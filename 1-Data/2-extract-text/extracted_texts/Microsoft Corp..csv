The latest estimates have the funding at $62 billion.</P><P>Macron and others are depending on the private sector to fill in the gap.</P><P>And private investors have been making announcements at the One Planet summit. On Tuesday morning, over 225 institutional investors, controlling over 26 trillion dollars of assets, say they will be working with 100 polluters, to put pressure on them as shareholders to reduce their <mark>carbon</mark> impact.</P><P>Investors are now paying attention to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>“I think there are more private sector leaders who mare much more interested in this agenda and think it is part of their corporate responsibility to take it seriously. But also, the pricing and technological changes have made this much more affordable for them as an investment,” Suma Chakrabarti, the President of the European bank of reconstruction and development, told RFI.</P><P>“If you’re a private sector leader, you will be looking at your bottom line. You will want to see whether you can marry this ‘planet-wise investment’, as I would call it, with something that’s going to help you make bigger profit for your shareholders. And now we’ve got the possibility to do that.”</P><P><STRONG>Green-washing summit</STRONG></P><P>Some NGOs criticise this summit as another instance of green-washing. Some point to the heads of state who are in Paris, who violate human rights in their countries.</P><P>And there are sceptics of green financing in general, like Maxime Combes, an economist and spokesperson on <mark>climate</mark> issues for Attac France, an anti-globalisation group.</P><P>A lot of these investment and green business initiatives are voluntary, and they do not go far enough, he told RFI: “We need public regulations to make sure that all companies change and not only 4 or 5 of them, or 50 per cent of them that change their business plans.”</P><P>Companies need to choose the <mark>climate</mark> over profit, he says, though it is still possible to turn a profit.</P><P>“You can have economic and financial profitability,; maybe not as much as the current system. But it’s still profitable on the long term. But to get long-term in financial system, you need regulations. When you don’t have regulations, you have speculation… and speculation is the opposite of long-term, and investment in energy transition.”</P><P>And yet, Macron is banking on green finance and the green economy, and part of reassuring investors is to show that there is government and institutional support.</P><P><STRONG>US missing</STRONG></P><P>One country is glaringly missing at the summit: the United States. Macron did not invite Trump, but there are many Americans here.</P><P>Michael Bloomberg, the financier and former mayor of New York, announced at the summit that over 200 companies have promised to disclose <mark>climate</mark>-related financial data.</P><P>He said the US does not need the federal government to make progress on <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>“Because the problems are at the local level and outside of government. And so you have local governments cleaning up their acts,” he said. The public is getting involved, as are corporations.</P><P>They are “becoming very environmentally friendly, because they have no choice.”</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

They include bolstering formal business alliances; working with California and other states whose governors seek to engage business on the issue; and trying to reframe the <mark>climate</mark> discussion by using terms such as “more resilient infrastructure” in place of “adaptation.”</P><P>Corporate voices are considered the last, and perhaps only, hope of getting Trump to focus on <mark>climate</mark> impacts at home and get him back to negotiations in <mark>climate</mark> talks abroad after his announcement June 1 that he is pulling the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement.</P><P>Dozens of Fortune 500 companies want to ensure they aren’t left outside the room in future talks that could impact whether their renewable energy and low-<mark>carbon</mark> technologies are able to compete with the more than 195 nations still in the pact.</P><P>Nothing in the work toward addressing <mark>climate</mark> “is as impressive as our business leaders saying we need America back at the table,” said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</P><H2>‘Lead By Example’</H2><P>Microsoft, which urged the Trump administration not to abandon the Paris agreement, seeks in the wake of Trump’s decision “to lead by example,” Rob Bernard, Microsoft’s chief environmental strategist, said in a statement to Bloomberg BNA.</P><P>The technology giant wants to invest in more renewable energy to power its global data center operations and expand its use of an internal <mark>carbon</mark> fee, which it began in 2012 to make its data centers, offices, manufacturing, and other business units accountable for their contributions to the company’s overall <mark>carbon</mark> footprint.</P><P>BP, which along with others in the energy sector such as Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and Shell backed the Paris <mark>climate</mark> pact, sees <mark>climate change</mark> as “an important long-term challenge justifying global action” in the wake of Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris deal, and it continues to back an economywide price on <mark>carbon</mark>, BP America said in a statement to Bloomberg BNA.</P><P>The company said it will continue to back increased production of natural gas, which is less <mark>carbon</mark>-intensive than oil or coal, and support more <mark>innovation</mark> in <mark>carbon</mark>-mitigation technologies.</P><P>Other large companies are part of the Center for <mark>Climate</mark> and Energy Solutions’ Business Environmental Leadership Council, a group of mostly Fortune 500 companies launched in 1998 to back mandatory <mark>climate</mark> policies. Earlier this month, the group’s members—which include Bank of America, Duke Energy, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy—were joined by Amazon, which the council said was the leading U.S. corporate purchaser of renewable energy last year.</P><P>“It has never been more important to bring business leaders together with policymakers to explore pragmatic steps toward a clean energy future,” Bob Perciasepe, the center’s president, said in a statement.</P><P>Beyond those corporate efforts, a total of 14 states including California, New York, Rhode Island, Virginia, and Washington also have launched the U.S. <mark>Climate</mark> Alliance, pledging to fill the gap from the federal retreat on <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P>California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) has announced plans to host a September 2018 international <mark>climate</mark> summit in San Francisco in which he envisions entrepreneurs, world leaders and others exploring solutions. And the nonprofit <mark>Climate</mark> Group will host <mark>Climate</mark> Week NYC in New York Sept. 18 to 24 featuring business leaders and others to advocate for <mark>climate</mark> action to coincide with the annual UN General Assembly.</P><H2>Reframing the Discussion</H2><P>Some say reframing the discussion could help in pushing policies that ensure roads, bridges, and other projects are better able to weather sea level rise, more flooding and higher temperatures.</P><P>“The data shows that as we get temperature increases, we get more cracking potholes, increased flooding, and you end up with more infrastructure loss,” Lisa Grice, global director of sustainability services at the Ramboll Environ, an environmental consulting firm, told Bloomberg BNA.</P><P>The Trump administration is more likely over time to be receptive to ideas that benefit the clean energy industry or bolster reliability of the power grid if framed not so much as <mark>climate</mark>-friendly projects but rather “wins for driving jobs or providing other economic value,” according to Grice, who worked during the Bush administration to launch the Environmental Protection Agency’s <mark>Climate</mark> Leaders program, which recognized voluntary corporate action on <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P>“You need to think of these as <mark>climate change</mark> tactics,” she said, such as completing infrastructure projects that the administration can tout as simply making good on Trump’s pledge for improved roads and bridges. They may include what Grice calls improved “asphalt road resiliency” that—without directly mentioning <mark>climate change</mark>—will shore up defenses against <mark>climate</mark> impacts.</P><P>Some of that change in terminology may appear subtle at first but is likely necessary, according to Grice, who said a preference for the more neutral-sounding term of “resiliency” over <mark>climate</mark> adaptation is already underway.</P><P>“We have a challenge not just from extreme storm events but also a combination of typical storm events with modest sea level rise, which also creates all kinds of property loss and impacts and elevates the cost of <mark>climate</mark> adaptation,” Grice said. “Finding a way to frame the federal government as a hero or savior would really appeal to this administration” if it could point to progress in shoring up communities from those threats, even as it will likely do so without even mentioning <mark>climate</mark>, she said.</P><P>“Now, the more individual companies can help frame anything that the federal government is doing around, say, energy efficiency, renewable energy, or <mark>climate</mark> resilience as a win for driving jobs or other economic value will incentivize this administration to do more,” she said. </P><H2>No Letting Up</H2><P>The Trump administration so far has shown no signs of letting up on its campaign against <mark>climate</mark> policies, from ending overseas <mark>climate</mark> aid to rolling back Obama administration rules cutting vehicle and power plant greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P>A coordinated business campaign to keep the U.S. in the Paris deal also didn’t sway Trump. About 1,000 companies and investors urged the president to stay, including U.S. industry leaders in technology, energy, health, and manufacturing such as Apple, Google, Facebook, HP, Intel Corp., Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Johnson Controls and Mars Inc.</P><P>More recently, <mark>climate</mark>-friendly corporate voices may also have to overcome what appears to be a growing schism between some corporate leaders and Trump over his response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., earlier this month. Trump disbanded two advisory groups made up of CEOs—the Strategy &amp; Policy Forum and the Manufacturing Council—but only after corporate chiefs began resigning.</P><P>Also scrapped: an Advisory Council on Infrastructure, which Trump only created in mid-July to advise him on his $1 trillion infrastructure plan. Among the projects the infrastructure panel was to make recommendations on were two that could impact the U.S. <mark>carbon</mark> footprint: renewable energy generation and electricity transmission.</P><P>The Trump administration argues that it isn’t losing a seat at the table in international <mark>climate</mark> talks even as it walks away from the Paris deal because it can continue in negotiations under the parent treaty to the Paris deal, the UN Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark>. Even with Trump’s announcement, the U.S. cannot technically withdraw from the Paris pact for four years, a span that gives U.S. companies and other supporters years to push Trump to reconsider his withdrawal. </P><H2>Still Prodding Trump to Tweak Pledge</H2><P>Some continue to argue that Trump can address much of his concern by taking advantage of flexibility in the Paris accord that allows nations to adjust their pledges to curb greenhouse gas emissions. That would allow Trump to pare back the U.S. pledge Obama made to the Paris deal, which is to cut emissions up to 28 percent by 2025 from 2005 levels.</P><P>“Rather than withdrawing from the agreement, a process that will take several years to accomplish, the U.S. is free to adjust its commitment if the [Trump] Administration feels the original commitment is inappropriate,” Stephen Harper, Intel Corp.'s global director of environment and energy policy, said in a statement to Bloomberg BNA.</P><P>“The Paris process will also provide a forum for countries to strike additional bi- and multilateral deals on technology transfer, particularly in the area of renewables and alternative energy,” Harper said.</P><P>“U.S. companies will lose business if we are not part of such deals,” he said, and the specter of a U.S. withdrawal from a deal signed by more than 190 parties could isolate it from world efforts to confront global warming and develop the renewable energy technologies those nations will need for such a global effort, he said.</P><P>Staying outside what is now a “virtually global effort to address <mark>climate change</mark> could make it vulnerable to border taxes and other trade retaliation by countries who are part of that effort,” Harper said, and such policies “would punish U.S. exports and our economy.”</P><H2>‘Open to Re-Engaging’</H2><P>Trump “is open to re-engaging in the Paris Agreement if the United States can identify terms that are more favorable to it, its businesses, its workers, its people, and its taxpayers,” according to a State Department statement issued Aug. 4 as the U.S. notified the UN of its plans to withdraw.One theme the Trump administration intends to bring to future <mark>climate change</mark> negotiations, according to the statement, is finding ways to help other countries “access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently.”</P><P>Myron Ebell, energy and environment director at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, who favored withdrawal from the Paris accord, said he reads any hint of a renegotiation as little more than a token acknowledgment to those in the Trump camp who favor international engagement.</P><P>“The president has clearly said that the only deal the U.S. would be interested in doing would be one that would serve America’s interests,” Ebell said. “As he has defined it, America’s interest is to be the world’s largest energy producer and to become one of the major coal, oil, and liquefied natural gas exporters in the world.”</P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

We are working to consistently reduce our <mark>carbon</mark> footprint, and we are committed to taking significant action to shape our energy future by developing clean, low-cost sources and building a greener grid to supply energy.&quot;</SPAN></P><P><B><SPAN>How did you<SPAN class=""apple-converted-space""> </SPAN>decide on your 100% goal and what did you do to reach it?</SPAN></B></P><P><SPAN>&quot;In 2012 we made a commitment to becoming <mark>carbon</mark>-neutral. We knew that driving company-wide accountability would be critical. So the environment team worked with senior leadership to get their support, and then we made our business divisions financially responsible for the cost of their emissions through a <mark>carbon</mark> fee. Switching to renewable electricity made business sense.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN><B>What have been your achievements so far?</B></SPAN></P><P><SPAN>&quot;Once we had both the support of the company and the mechanisms in place, we bought renewable energy credits and <mark>carbon</mark> offsets, and invested in renewable energy projects like the<SPAN class=""apple-converted-space""> </SPAN><A href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/microsoft-green/archive/2014/11/12/keechi-wind-project-one-year-later.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Keechi Wind Project</A><SPAN class=""apple-converted-space""> </SPAN>and the Pilot Hill Wind Project, to provide locally-sourced renewable electricity to nearby data centers. We also generate a small amount of electricity from solar panels covering the rooftops on our Silicon Valley campus.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>&quot;By matching the volume of our electricity consumption with renewable power investments, we have procured 100% renewable power for our global operations. These efforts have been recognized by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Green Power Partnership, which ranks us as the second largest green power purchaser for US operations.&quot;</SPAN></P><P><B><SPAN>What opportunities and challenges are you encountering?</SPAN></B></P><P><SPAN>&quot;As Microsoft has transitioned from a software company to a mobile-first, cloud-first company, our energy footprint has changed. Data centers are critical to enabling and powering our cloud offerings, but they also consume a great deal of electricity. This is both our biggest challenge and opportunity – as a technology company we have great tools to use electricity more smartly.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>&quot;We endeavor to increase our direct purchasing of renewable electricity to power our operations. Unfortunately, in many parts of the U.S. and around the world, renewables are still a very small part of the energy portfolio of local utility companies. The demand from companies like Microsoft and other RE100 corporate partners is outstripping the existing supply, and new projects take capital investment, political will and buyers to come online. Even then, it takes several years between striking an agreement and renewable electricity actually becoming available. We are a big customer with a growing need, which means we have the opportunity to address the challenge of bringing more clean energy on the grid. That is why we’re also working with others, through groups like RE100 and the Buyers’ Principles.&quot;</SPAN></P><P><B><SPAN>Why do you think it is important for companies to play a role in accelerating demand for renewable electricity and how can we get more companies to go 100%?</SPAN></B></P><P><SPAN>&quot;The private sector accounts for around half of the world’s electricity consumption so together we can make a real difference.<SPAN class=""apple-converted-space""><B> </B></SPAN>Collaborating with other companies sends a signal to utilities and suppliers that cannot be ignored, which will ultimately make renewable energy more affordable and accessible.&quot;<I> </I></SPAN></P><P><B>Why do you think RE100 is a good initiative to join?</B></P><P>&quot;We have been powered by renewables since 2014, but we believe there is still more that we can do to advance a low-<mark>carbon</mark>, <mark>sustainable</mark> economy. By joining RE100, we have the opportunity to collaborate with other sustainability leaders, share best practices, and work collectively to drive change to achieve greater global impact. Together, we send a strong market signal to utilities that there is demand for more renewables on the grid, which should in turn lead to increased supply, benefitting both companies and the public.&quot;</P><P><B><SPAN>How else are you helping to drive forward the transition to a low <mark>carbon</mark> economy?</SPAN></B></P><P><SPAN>&quot;Our internal <mark>carbon</mark> fee model has been received with great enthusiasm and engagement throughout the company as teams drive down their <mark>carbon</mark> emissions.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>&quot;Our approach to sustainability is also integrated into the products and services we offer.

  assessment, using our standard risk management  framework. We assessed risks and opportunities across 
  both potential transition (e.g., regulatory,  policy, reputational) and physical (e.g., extreme <mark>climate</mark> events) 
  aspects of <mark>climate change</mark>. We have identified the  top three <mark>climate</mark>-related risks and opportunities for our 
  business: an increase in extended duration  extreme precipitation events; an increase in <mark>climate change</mark> 
  regulations to limit greenhouse gas (“GHG”)  emissions; and increased global investment in <mark>innovation</mark> and low 
  <mark>carbon</mark> technologies. The assessment also included  a review of the current mitigation and controls associated 
with each risk and identified areas which may  need further strengthening to reduce risk.</P><P><STRONG>Reduce the Company’s impact on <mark>climate change</mark>:</STRONG> Over the course of 2017,  we analyzed our current and 
  forecasted GHG emissions to develop an ambitious  but realistic goal to reduce Barrick’s GHG emissions. Mining 
  is an energy-intensive business, and we  understand the important link between energy use and GHG emissions. 
  By effectively managing our energy use, we can  reduce our draw from local energy grids, reduce our GHG 
  emissions, achieve more efficient production, and  save direct mining costs. Barrick has set a goal to keep its 
  current GHG emissions flat in the short term and  is targeting a 30 percent reduction in GHG emissions by 
  2030, from a 2016 baseline of 3.5 MT <mark>CO2</mark>e  emitted. This target is also closely aligned with the national targets 
set by many of our host governments.</P><H3 class=""color--blue"">Barrick has set a goal to keep its current  GHG emissions flat in the short term and is targeting a 30 percent reduction in  GHG emissions by 2030, from a 2016 baseline of 3.5 MT <mark>CO2</mark>e emitted.</H3><P><STRONG>Improve our disclosure on <mark>climate change</mark></STRONG>:  In 2017, we committed to supporting the voluntary

will implement the full recommendations over the  next two years.</P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SPAN><SPAN class=""ContentPaneDiv4""><DIV id=""_ctrl0_ctl78_divModuleContainer"" class=""module module-html accordion_item accordion_item--first""><DIV class=""module_container module_container--outer""><DIV class=""module_container module_container--inner""><DIV class=""accordion_trigger""><H2>Governance</H2></DIV><DIV class=""accordion_panel grid""><DIV class=""grid_col grid_col--8-of-12 grid_col--md-12-of-12""><P>Governance over <mark>climate</mark>-related risks and  opportunities is provided at both the Board and management level.

Committee assists the Board in overseeing the  Company’s management of enterprise risks as well as the 
implementation of policies and standards for  monitoring and mitigating such risks. <mark>Climate change</mark> is built into our 
formal risk management process, outputs of which  are reviewed by the Risk Committee. The Audit Committee 
reviews the Company’s approach to <mark>climate change</mark>  in the context of Barrick’s disclosures.</P><P>At the management level, our <mark>Climate Change</mark>  Committee, comprised of senior members of our management team, provides  strategic oversight and governance over key decisions related to Barrick’s  <mark>Climate</mark> 
  Change Strategy, such as overseeing <mark>climate</mark>  change risk and opportunity assessments, monitoring progress 
  against GHG emissions targets, and providing  guidance on external disclosures. Further to the specific focus of the <mark>Climate</mark>  Change Committee, the weekly BPR allows for the discussion of opportunities and  risks that may help or hinder the Company from achieving its objectives,  including <mark>climate</mark>-related risks (e.g., spring snow melts, hurricanes, flooding,  and mud slides).</P><P><mark>Climate change</mark> activities initiated in 2017 will  continue into 2018 and beyond. Site-level <mark>climate</mark>-related risks and 
  mitigation plans will be reviewed in the context  of the company-wide risk assessment, and site-level plans to 
  reduce energy and GHG emissions will be  strengthened. We will continue to enhance our <mark>climate</mark>-related 
  disclosure according to the TCFD recommendations. </P><P>Overall, based on the groundwork completed in  2017, Barrick is building resilience to withstand the potential

The largest human-caused methane source is the oil and gas industry (about 33 percent), but raising livestock comes a close second (27 percent), and rice production alone <A href=""https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7110/full/nature05132.html"">contributes 9 percent</A> of methane emissions.</P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-3935d64b-e131-68e3-4076-a39c960cfade"">Much of the methane emitted in the rice production process comes because of the way rice is grown—immersed in water, creating ripe conditions for the bacteria that emit methane.

  aspects of <mark>climate change</mark>. We have identified the  top three <mark>climate</mark>-related risks and opportunities for our

  regulations to limit greenhouse gas (“GHG”)  emissions; and increased global investment in <mark>innovation</mark> and low

  is an energy-intensive business, and we  understand the important link between energy use and GHG emissions. 
  By effectively managing our energy use, we can  reduce our draw from local energy grids, reduce our GHG 
  emissions, achieve more efficient production, and  save direct mining costs. Barrick has set a goal to keep its 
  current GHG emissions flat in the short term and  is targeting a 30 percent reduction in GHG emissions by 
  2030, from a 2016 baseline of 3.5 MT <mark>CO2</mark>e  emitted. This target is also closely aligned with the national targets 
set by many of our host governments.</P><H3 class=""color--blue"">Barrick has set a goal to keep its current  GHG emissions flat in the short term and is targeting a 30 percent reduction in  GHG emissions by 2030, from a 2016 baseline of 3.5 MT <mark>CO2</mark>e emitted.</H3><P><STRONG>Improve our disclosure on <mark>climate change</mark></STRONG>:  In 2017, we committed to supporting the voluntary

But <mark>carbon</mark> trading is complex under any circumstances, and particularly so when the entities generating the offsets grow rice or corn or raise cows.

Globally, methane accounts for about <A href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf"">16 percent</A> of </SPAN>human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. The largest human-caused methane source is the oil and gas industry (about 33 percent), but raising livestock comes a close second (27 percent), and rice production alone <A href=""https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7110/full/nature05132.html"">contributes 9 percent</A> of methane emissions.</P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-3935d64b-e131-68e3-4076-a39c960cfade"">Much of the methane emitted in the rice production process comes because of the way rice is grown—immersed in water, creating ripe conditions for the bacteria that emit methane. But researchers have found that &quot;dry seeding&quot; the rice, or planting the rice before the field is flooded, alternating between dry and wet periods and draining the field earlier in the season can reduce methane buildup.</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-3935d64b-e131-68e3-4076-a39c960cfade"">The seven growers that took part in the recent trade used these practices on 2,000 acres of farmland, ultimately generating reductions of 600 tons of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide equivalent. The emissions reductions were calculated using a &quot;DNDC&quot; model—denitrification and decomposition—that compares results against dozens of other sites across years of production.  </SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-3935d64b-e131-68e3-4076-a39c960cfade"">The process was shepherded by the Environmental Defense Fund, funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and southern power company Entergy, and overseen by a San Francisco-based investor called Terra Global, among others.</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-3935d64b-e131-68e3-4076-a39c960cfade"">&quot;You put in all kinds of data around the practices that were implemented in the field,&quot; explained Leslie Durschinger, founder and CEO of Terra Global, which brokered the deal between the growers and Microsoft. &quot;Then you say: On this year, I did alternative drying and wetting. You put in that data and it produces the greenhouse gas emissions.&quot;</SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-3935d64b-e131-68e3-4076-a39c960cfade"">This trade happened in a voluntary market—the American <mark>Carbon</mark> Registry—but it was based on a protocol, or system, similar to the protocol California approved in 2015 to allow rice farmers to generate offsets to be sold in the state's cap-and-trade market.

(Reed says this is the first cropland-based trade she's aware of in the U.S. Other cropland-based trades have occurred, Reed explained, but as private transactions, not within <mark>carbon</mark> markets that have peer-reviewed processes and offset methodologies.) When nitrogen-based fertilizer breaks down in soil, it releases nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas with roughly 300 times the warming potential of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide. The 2014 National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment says <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/topic/agriculture"">agriculture</A> is responsible for about 60 percent of nitrous oxide emissions, due to the heavy use of nitrogen-based fertilizer.</P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-3935d64b-e131-68e3-4076-a39c960cfade"">While the cropland-based trades that have occurred in the U.S. so far have been voluntary, others have occurred within compliance markets, including in Alberta, Canada and Australia.  </SPAN></P><P dir=""ltr""><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-3935d64b-e131-68e3-4076-a39c960cfade"">Proponents are optimistic that the recent trade could spur buyers in California's cap-and-trade market to look toward rice-based offsets.

The <EM>Times</EM> notes that Trump fears it'll harm the economy, hurt job creation in areas where many of his supporters live and damage his &quot;American first&quot; message.

DiNapoli today announced that ExxonMobil has <A href=""exxon-agreement-letter.pdf"">agreed</A> to implement the shareholder request that the company analyze how worldwide efforts to adopt the Paris Agreement goals for reducing global warming might impact its business. The request, co-filed by the New York State Common Retirement Fund (the Fund) and the Church of England, received landslide support from more than 62 percent of Exxon voting shareholders at the company's annual meeting in May. As a result of the company's decision, the Fund will withdraw the shareholder proposal, which it refiled on Nov. 28, 2017.</P><P>&quot;ExxonMobil's adoption of greater <mark>climate</mark> analysis is a win for shareholders and for the company's ability to manage risk,&quot; said New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli. &quot;I am pleased Exxon has agreed to undertake this important analysis. <mark>Climate change</mark> is one of the greatest threats to our pension fund's long-term value. Exxon's decision demonstrates that investors have the power to hold corporations accountable and to compel them to address our very real <mark>climate</mark>-related concerns. We will continue to monitor Exxon's response to <mark>climate change</mark> as we urge the company, and others in the energy sector, to find ways that they can adapt to the growing lower <mark>carbon</mark> economy.&quot;</P><P>The <A href=""/press/docs/exxon-mobil-corporation-shareholder-proposal.pdf"">shareholder proposal</A> asked Exxon to analyze how the Paris Agreement's goal of restricting global temperatures to no more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels will affect its business and to assess the financial risks associated with that 2-degree scenario.</P><P>While Exxon has previously recognized that changing regulations could reduce demand for its products and impact or delay its projects, it has not yet provided meaningful analysis of how the globally agreed upon 2-degree target will affect its position in the marketplace. Investors have a right to know how the company might be affected by, and respond to, a lower demand for fossil fuels due to changing regulations and restrictions.</P><P>DiNapoli and the Fund have filed the proposal at several other corporations and it has since been adopted by PPL Corporation and others.</P><P><STRONG>Timeline of the NYS Common Retirement Fund's Engagement with Exxon </STRONG></P><UL><LI>Dec. 2015: The Fund and the Church of England first <A href=""/press/releases/jan16/011916.htm"">file their proposal</A> with ExxonMobil.</LI><LI>Jan. 2016: ExxonMobil seeks <A href=""/press/releases/feb16/022416.htm"">Securities and Exchange Commission</A> approval to omit the proposal from consideration at its annual meeting.</LI><LI>March 2016: The <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-exxon-mobil-shareholders-exclusive/exxon-mobil-must-allow-<mark>climate</mark>-change-vote-sec-idUSKCN0WP2TG"" target=""_blank"">SEC rejects</A> ExxonMobil's request.</LI><LI>May 2016: Dozens of major institutional investors <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-exxon-mobil-shareholders/calpers-nyc-pensions-urge-exxon-investors-to-back-<mark>climate</mark>-measure-idUSKCN0Y22IB"" target=""_blank"">announce</A> support for the Fund's proposal.

There are few societal areas where AI can be more impactful than in helping address the urgent work needed to monitor, model and manage the earth’s natural systems.”</P><P>In the blog he writes that tapping into technology help to capture the vast amount of data already being collected on the health of the planet, including air, water and land conditions, “and convert it into actionable intelligence.”</P><P>According to him, AI can be trained to classify raw data from sensors on the ground, in the sky or in space.</P><P>“Fundamentally, AI can accelerate our ability to observe environmental systems and how they are changing at a global scale, convert the data into useful information and apply that information to take concrete steps to better manage our natural resources,” he writes.</P><P>He called out a handful of successful projects around the world that are already putting AI to work on <mark>climate</mark>, water, agriculture and biodiversity challenges.</P><P>The blog lays out three steps for using the new funding and expanding the AI program.</P><P>First, they plan to expand seed grants around to create and test new AI applications. They also plan to provide universities, nongovernmental organizations and others with advanced training to put AI to its best use.</P><P>Next, the plan is to identify projects that show the most promise and make larger investments in them.</P><P>Finally, as the projects advance, they plan to identify and pursue opportunities to incorporate new AI advances into “platform-level services so that others can use them for their own sustainability initiatives.”</P><P>Some of this will involve platform services that will be offered by others, and in other instances, these may be incorporated into Microsoft’s own platform services.</P><P>As we enter the world’s Fourth Industrial Revolution, a technology-fueled transformation, we must not only move technology forward, but also use this era’s technology to clean up the past and create a better future,” Smith writes.</P><P><STRONG>Alaskan Snowfall</STRONG></P><P>Snowfall since the beginning of the industrial age has more than doubled on an Alaskan mountain range, a new study shows.</P><P>The study by researchers from Dartmouth College, the University of Maine and the University of New Hampshire, is based on an analysis of ice core samples collected from Mount Hunter in Denali National Park.</P><P>The range now has an average of 18 feet of snow per year.

Many experts agree that the pledges alone will not hold global temperatures below 2˚ C—we also need significant energy technology <mark>innovation</mark> in order to meet the <mark>climate</mark> goals. The International Energy Agency estimated that fulfilling all the <mark>climate</mark> pledges would require investments of $13.5 trillion in energy efficiency and low-<mark>carbon</mark> technologies by 2030; keeping the temperature increase below 2˚ C would require an additional $3 trillion.</P><P>“…We need an energy miracle,” says Bill Gates. The world needs energy that produces zero <mark>CO2</mark> emissions, is cheaper than today’s fossil fuels, and is completely reliable. Despite the growth of renewable power, the intermittent nature of wind and solar energy and the limited capacity to store power still impede the widespread implementation of renewables.</P><P>The top five tech companies, whose power, wealth and influence keep expanding, are continually pushing the technological envelope. What are Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and their founders doing about <mark>climate change</mark>?</P><P><STRONG>Bill Gates</STRONG>, founder of <STRONG>Microsoft</STRONG>, said that to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>, “We need a massive amount of research into thousands of new ideas—even ones that might sound a little crazy—if we want to get to zero emissions by the end of this century.”</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Private investment focused on <mark>climate change</mark> “shows the people in government that this isn’t just about academics trying to get grants, but that it’s really the central issue of our time.” —Steve Cohen</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Meanwhile, the U.S. Energy Department’s budget for R&amp;D is about $5 billion, approximately the same as it was five years ago. To remedy this situation, Gates has launched the <EM><A href=""http://www.breakthroughenergycoalition.com/en/index.html"">Breakthrough Energy Coalition </A></EM>along with 27 of the world’s richest billionaires, including Jeff Bezos (Amazon), Richard Branson (Virgin Group), Jack Ma (Alibaba), Meg Whitman (Hewlett Packard), Mark Zuckerberg and Dr. Priscilla Chan (Facebook), all of whom have pledged billions of dollars to be invested into researching new energy technologies. They will work in tandem with <EM><A href=""http://www.mission-<mark>innovation</mark>.net"">Mission <mark>Innovation</mark></A></EM>, a consortium of 20 countries including the United States, that have pledged to double their investments in clean energy to $20 billion over the next five years. The investment model will be a public-private partnership between governments, research institutions and investors.</P><P>The coalition wants to invest in new technologies and <mark>innovation</mark>s that will make energy more efficient, scalable and cheaper. And since no one knows where the best ideas will come from, it will invest across the board in electricity generation and storage, transportation, industrial use, agriculture and energy efficiency.</P><DIV id=""attachment_56160"" style=""max-width: 303px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis at Berkeley Lab</P></DIV><P>A few of the innovative technologies that could draw investments include solar chemical, artificial photosynthesis that would use sunlight to split water molecules into hydrogen fuel; flow batteries that could be as large as a swimming pool that could potentially last for decades; solar paint that generates electricity from the sun and could one day turn any surface into a solar panel; and wave and tidal energy.</P><DIV id=""attachment_56162"" style=""max-width: 303px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">A tidal turbine prototypePhoto: Scottish Government</P></DIV><P>Gates himself has invested in <EM><A href=""http://terrapower.com"">TerraPower</A></EM>, a company developing a nuclear “traveling wave reactor” that is 50 times as efficient as and more economical than a conventional reactor. The traveling wave reactor uses depleted uranium as fuel, which reduces the need to enrich uranium, minimizes the risk of bad actors obtaining weapons-usable material and solves the problem of nuclear waste. According to the company’s website, the traveling wave reactor could use all the depleted uranium that currently sits in storage in the United States to generate enough electricity to power all American households for 700 years. Moreover, it has safety features that enable it to be shut down automatically in case of emergency. TerraPower expects to build a 600-megawatt prototype in the mid-2020s.</P><P>Gates has invested in <EM><A href=""http://www.aquionenergy.com"">Aquion Energy Inc</A>.</EM>, which is developing safe, <mark>sustainable</mark> saltwater batteries to supply backup energy when solar and wind energy aren’t available. He has also invested in <EM><A href=""http://www.lightsail.com"">LightSail Energy</A></EM>, a company developing technology that uses compressed air to store energy by capturing the excess heat generated from mechanical energy like a piston that is usually wasted.</P><P>Gates is an investor in<EM><A href=""http://<mark>carbon</mark>engineering.com""><mark>Carbon</mark> Engineering</A></EM>, a company that is commercializing technology to capture <mark>CO2</mark> directly from the air. After processing, the pure <mark>CO2</mark> that is captured can be sequestered underground or sold for use in industrial processes as ultra-low emissions fuel. According to the website, “Direct air capture can remove far more <mark>CO2</mark> per acre of land footprint than trees and plants.” The company is already running a demonstration plant in Squamish, British Columbia, that is removing one ton of <mark>CO2</mark> from the air daily.</P><P>Microsoft Research’s Earth, Energy and Environment projects develop technologies for scientific visualization and data management to enhance understanding of <mark>climate</mark> and ecosystems. Among them are a network of sensors in the Brazilian rain forest to study conditions and help scientists understand how the ecosystem affects <mark>climate</mark> and vice versa. The Joulemeter project makes it possible to measure the energy usage of virtual machines, servers, desktops, laptops and individual software applications running on a computer so that power in data centers can be managed more efficiently.</P><P>In addition to investing as a member of the Breakthrough Energy Coalition,<STRONG> Amazon</STRONG> founder <STRONG>Jeff Bezos</STRONG> has put money into <A href=""http://www.generalfusion.com""><EM>General Fusion</EM></A>, a Canadian company that is using an unorthodox technology to develop commercially viable fusion energy. For decades, scientists have been trying to capture nuclear fusion, the process by which the sun generates energy, because it is non-polluting, safe and produces no greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P>As a company, Amazon is committed to eventually running completely on renewable energy. In April 2015, 25 percent of the power consumed by its infrastructure came from renewable resources. By the end of 2016, it aims to reach 40 percent with energy coming from its wind farms in development in Indiana, North Carolina and Ohio, and its solar farm in Virginia.</P><DIV id=""attachment_56167"" style=""max-width: 303px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Green Mountain Wind Farm in Texas.

The grants, ranging from $10,000 to $100,000, are open to all disciplines.</P><P>In 2015, <STRONG>Apple </STRONG>contracted with First Solar in Monterey County, California, to build a solar energy farm that will provide enough electricity to power all of Apple’s California stores, offices, headquarters and a data center, an $850 million investment. The company has also developed three solar plants in North Carolina and one in Nevada. As well, Apple will build 200 megawatts worth of solar projects across China on top of its existing 40 megawatts of solar projects in Sichuan Province to offset the energy used in its supply chain. In the future, the company plans to install more than 2 gigawatts of new renewable energy in China. Foxconn, a major Apple supplier, is also planning to build 400 megawatts of solar projects in Henan Province by 2018.</P><P>There is also speculation that Apple is developing an electric vehicle for 2019, code-named Project Titan. Electric vehicles, especially if the electricity comes from renewable sources, are key to reducing greenhouse gas emissions since 14 percent of global <mark>CO2</mark> emissions come from transportation. If the car is also self-driving, its emissions could be up to 90 percent lower than those of today’s gasoline-driven cars.</P><P><STRONG>Facebook </STRONG>founder <STRONG>Mark Zuckerberg </STRONG>and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, have pledged to give away 99 percent of their Facebook shares through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative LLC.

Google’s<EM><A href=""https://www.littleboxchallenge.com"">Little Box Challenge</A></EM>, co-sponsored by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, was an open competition awarding $1 million to the team that created a small power inverter. Inverters are devices that take direct current from solar panels and batteries and convert it into alternating current for use in homes, businesses and cars. Usually, inverters are the size of picnic coolers, but creating an inverter that is smaller than a laptop will enable broader use of solar power, more efficient distributed grids and help bring electricity to remote areas. This month, CE+T Power’s <A href=""http://www.cet-power.com"">The Red Electrical Devils</A> was declared the winner. They beat out over 2,000 teams by creating a 2kW inverter with the highest power density and smallest volume, 10 times more compact than commercial inverters.</P><P><STRONG>Larry Page</STRONG>, co-founder of Google, has invested in <EM><A href=""https://www.teslamotors.com"">Tesla Motors</A></EM>, which is developing long-range battery powered electric vehicles and batteries for storage.

Global meat production today already requires enormous amounts of land and water and is responsible for 18 percent of our greenhouse gas emissions; with the demand for meat expected to increase by two-thirds by 2050, it will be difficult to feed the expanding global population. According to Maastricht University, which created the first synthetic burger, cells from a single cow could eventually produce 175 million burgers, while it would take 440,000 cows to produce those burgers by traditional means.</P><P><STRONG>Eric Schmidt, </STRONG>former CEO and now executive chairman of Alphabet, and his wife, Wendy, founded the <EM>Schmidt Family Foundation</EM> that focuses on sustainability and the environment.

Google.org has invested in a company that makes solar panels, a company developing a kite system that will tap into the jet stream for energy, and a geothermal demonstration project. Through its Global Impact Awards, Google.org has given to the World Wildlife Fund to protect wildlife, the Natural Capital Project to integrate the value of natural capital into decision making, and charity: water that brings clean water to people in need.</P><P><EM><A href=""http://www.gv.com"">Google Ventures</A></EM>, the venture capital arm of Alphabet, provides funding to technology companies. While it is mainly focused on life sciences, engineering and design, it has also invested in Cool Planet Energy Systems, which is developing negative <mark>carbon</mark> and <mark>carbon</mark> neutral fuels based on photosynthesis; Transphorm, which creates modules that save energy across the grid; and Silver Springs Networks, a smart grid solutions provider.</P><DIV id=""attachment_56161"" style=""max-width: 303px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">A Long Island solar farm Photo: Brookhaven National Lab</P></DIV><P><EM><A href=""https://www.google.com/green/"">Google Green</A></EM>’s goal is to make the company more environmentally friendly through energy efficiency and renewable power. Already, Google is the world’s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy; it has pledged to purchase nearly 2 gigawatts of renewable energy and to invest $2.5 billion in renewable energy projects. Thirty-seven percent of its operations are powered by renewable energy, and the company plans to triple its purchases of renewable energy by 2025. It has invested in over 20 solar and wind projects.</P><P>“<mark>Climate change</mark> is everybody’s problem, but not everyone can afford to do something about it. Those who can should help,” said Vijay Modi, professor of mechanical engineering and director of the <mark>Sustainable</mark> Engineering Lab at Columbia University. “We need billionaires putting in their money. But we also need bottom up continuous efforts that occur at the same time, like providing the basic necessities of lighting and communication, things the poor in Africa and India don’t yet have.”</P><P>The investment of these major companies and billionaires “legitimizes the issue of <mark>climate change</mark>,” said Steve Cohen, executive director of the Earth Institute. “It shows the people in government that this isn’t just about academics trying to get grants, but that it’s really the central issue of our time. And it’s very important in moving the dialogue from ‘is this a problem?’ to ‘how do we address the problem?’”</P><P>“But the corporate money isn’t enough,” he said. “We really need the budget of the federal government to be much more dedicated to researching the science of <mark>climate change</mark>. We need the collective scale and muscle of the U.S. government. … Only it has the resources to deal with this.”</P><P>Cohen is optimistic that the world is moving in the right direction, though. “I think we’re going to solve these problems.

The statement was coordinated by a large collective of organizations including World Wildlife Fund, Rocky Mountain Institute, <mark>Climate</mark> Mayors, Ceres and Bloomberg Philanthropies. It has grown to include more than 1,500 businesses and investors, as well as nine U.S. states, more than 200 cities and counties and more than 300 colleges and universities.</SPAN></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>In recent years, a number of initiatives and collaborations have sprung up around the world focused on private sector action on <mark>climate change</mark>.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION>And it’s not alone. In recent years, a number of initiatives and collaborations have sprung up around the world focused on private sector action on <mark>climate change</mark>. With Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris agreement, these initiatives have raised an intriguing question: In the absence of political action, can business save the world from devastating <mark>climate change</mark>?<P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>&quot;T</SPAN><SPAN>he simple answer is there’s no saving the world without business, but business can’t do it on its own,&quot; said Nigel Topping, CEO of <A href=""https://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org/""><SPAN>We Mean Business</SPAN></A>. &quot;The reason we need these kinds of coalitions is so that both business leaders and political leaders hear loud and clear that actually the majority of businesses understand that we’ve got to change, and actually are on board and already in motion.&quot;</SPAN></P><P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>We Mean Business is a global coalition of many of the same NGOs that initiated We Are Still In — CDP (formerly the <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project), the B Team, the <mark>Climate</mark> Group and others — and the two initiatives are closely connected. We Mean Business’s role is to provide a framework for corporate commitments on <mark>climate change</mark> and a platform from which to make those commitments public.</SPAN></P><H3>Science-based targets</H3><P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>One such commitment is to adopt science-based greenhouse gas emissions targets. This is where </SPAN><SPAN><A href=""http://sciencebasedtargets.org/""><SPAN>Science Based Targets</SPAN></A></SPAN><SPAN> comes in. This global collaboration among CDP, World Resources Institute, the World Wide Fund and the United Nations Global Compact encourages and helps corporations to align their <mark>climate change</mark> policies with scientific evidence.</SPAN></P><P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>&quot;What we could observe is a majority of companies were setting targets, but at least from a CDP perspective, we had many challenges to understand what targets were best,&quot; said Pedro Faria, technical director of CDP and member of the Science Based Targets steering committee</SPAN><SPAN>. &quot;Talking with companies and other NGOs, we realized there was no method, so companies were setting targets based on what was feasible and not what was needed.&quot;</SPAN></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>It has been extremely important to just make people aware of this concept: Set your ambition according to what the best available science tells you.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></SECTION>Science Based Targets helps companies determine what actions they need to take to contribute meaningfully to the global target of remaining below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) warming, a level above which experts say irreversible changes become locked in<SPAN>. These actions will vary across industries, so targets must be tailored to individual companies while still meeting global needs. Nearly 300 companies have signed on from every continent except Antarctica.</SPAN><P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>&quot;It has been extremely important to just make people aware of this concept: Set your ambition according to what the best available science tells you,&quot; Faria said. &quot;Our mission is to make science-based targets a new norm.&quot; Sixty-two companies have set approved science-based targets for emissions reductions. For example, Coca-Cola HBC — a leading bottler of the Coca-Cola Company — has committed to a science-based target of reducing </SPAN><SPAN>its emissions by 50 percent per liter of drink by 2020.</SPAN></P><H3>Energy for renewables</H3><P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>Another corporate commitment We Mean Business advocates is the goal of 100 percent renewable power. More than 100 companies, including Ikea, Walmart, Nestle and Unilever, have committed to this, but in a complex energy market like that in the U.S., buying this much renewable energy isn’t always easy. So in May 2016, Business for Social Responsibility, the Rocky Mountain Institute, the World Resources Institute and World Wildlife Fund started the <A href=""http://rebuyers.org/"">Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance</A> (REBA), which helps steer corporations through the energy market maze. The end goal is facilitating the deployment of 60 gigawatts of new renewable energy in the U.S. corporate sector by 2025.</SPAN></P><P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>The alliance first made its mark with the World Wildlife Fund and World Resources Institute’s <A href=""http://buyersprinciples.org/""><SPAN>Corporate Renewable Energy Buyers’ Principles</SPAN></A>, a set of six criteria developed in partnership with a group of large energy buyers to assist utilities in helping companies who want to buy renewable energy.</SPAN></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Microsoft has stated that it is committed to working with the network and new partners to bring more renewable energy onto the grid.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>But more was needed, said Lily Donge, a principal at the Rocky Mountain Institute. &quot;We realized that the buyers need a trusted space to learn about renewable energy and also find ways to interact with each other and the service providers on the sale side in a more transparent and seamless fashion.&quot; Thus was born the <A href=""http://businessrenewables.org/"">Business Renewables Center</A>, which Donge heads.<P class=""selectionShareable"">The center convenes, educates and assists corporations around purchasing off-site, large-scale wind and solar energy. It also hopes to facilitate collective buying, although that aspect is still in development. Donge envisages a scenario in which a city — for example, Seattle — its universities, its utilities and a locally based company such as Microsoft might come together to pool their renewable energy buying power. As one of the first to join the REBA network, Microsoft has stated that it is committed to working with the network and new partners to bring more renewable energy onto the grid. It is just one of the 60 percent of Fortune 100 companies that have set emissions reductions targets or committed to clean energy.</P><H3>Turning words into action</H3><P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>If We Are Still In is the sentiment, We Mean Business is the statement of intent, and initiatives such as Science Based Targets and the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance are the enablers of action, then America’s Pledge will be the scorekeeper.</SPAN></P><P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>Launched July 12, <A href=""https://www.americaspledgeon<mark>climate</mark>.com/""><SPAN>America’s Pledge</SPAN></A> will compile and quantify the steps taken by businesses, cities, states and others to address <mark>climate change</mark>.</SPAN></P><P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>Looking across these initiatives, it’s clear which industries are leading the pack. &quot;If you’re one of the IT majors and you haven’t committed to 100 percent renewable electricity, you’re a laggard, you’re a dinosaur and you really start to stand out,&quot; Topping said. But other industries face more existential challenges around <mark>climate change</mark> action, particularly in the fossil fuel space.</SPAN></P><P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>&quot;While many of the oil majors are publicly supportive of <mark>climate</mark> action and the Paris agreement, some of them are still proposing future energy and emissions scenarios in which there are very high levels of <A href=""https://ensia.com/features/sequestration/""><mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage</A> deployment — levels way higher than the current level of investment suggests is plausible,&quot; Topping said.</SPAN></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>There’s no sector where there’s a sectoral <mark>climate</mark> denial or sectoral resistance to Paris.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>But even those industries are publicly engaged. The <A href=""https://www.clcouncil.org/""><mark>Climate</mark> Leadership Council</A>, which launched June 20, features big oil companies BP, ExxonMobil, Shell and Total among its founding corporate members.<P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>&quot;There’s no sector where there’s a sectoral <mark>climate</mark> denial or sectoral resistance to Paris,&quot; Topping said. &quot;It’s just a question of what is the economic pathway of survival.&quot;</SPAN></P><P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>WWF’s Senior Vice President of <mark>Climate Change</mark> and Energy Lou Leonard said the challenge ahead for all these initiatives and collaborations is to continue to demonstrate the credibility of the voice of these sub-national actors to the rest of the world, particularly in the lead-up to 2020 when all countries are supposed to return to the table with even more stringent targets than were committed to in 2016, in accordance with the Paris agreement.</SPAN></P><P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>&quot;There’s going to have to be a continual injection of confidence and support from non-state actors and sub-nationals in the U.S. if you want those countries to keep [working toward goals],&quot; he said. &quot;This is where the future is, this is where we are going, and we want the rest of the world to know it.&quot;</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""field field-name-field-gbz-article-source field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix""><DIV class=""field-label"">This story first appeared on: </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

In December, Rep. Jerry McNerney, a California Democrat, introduced an unprecedented <A href=""https://mcnerney.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-mcnerney-introduces-groundbreaking-geoengineering-bill"" target=""_blank"">bill</A> seeking funds for geoengineering research and development. In February, Trump signed a budget that includes <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2018/02/09/the-energy-202-budget-deal-picks-winners-and-losers-in-energy-industry/5a7c914b30fb041c3c7d76f7/?utm_term=.f099a77d7ba1"" target=""_blank"">first-ever tax breaks</A>, with bipartisan support, for using new technologies to <A href=""http://www.geoengineering.ox.ac.uk/what-is-geoengineering/what-is-geoengineering/"" target=""_blank"">capture <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide</A> from the atmosphere, a strategy many experts consider to be a kind of geoengineering.</P><P>“The future is bright for geoengineering,” Republican Rep. Randy Weber of Texas, chairman of the Energy Subcommittee of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, said at a <A href=""https://science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/subcommittee-environment-and-subcommittee-energy-hearing-geoengineering"" target=""_blank"">hearing</A> in November.</P><P>In the past, Weber has <A href=""https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/26/house-science-committee-c_n_5533992.html"" target=""_blank"">grilled scientists</A> on “global cooling” and rejected a <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> tax as “<A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/<mark>climate</mark>-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/apr/04/inconceivable-the-latest-theatrical-house-science-committee-hearing"" target=""_blank"">blasphemy</A>.” Yet at the hearing, he claimed that specific, yet-untested proposals such as “placement of mirrors in space” and “brightening the clouds overhead … could have a cooling effect on our lower atmosphere.”</P><H3>‘Hacking the planet’</H3><P>Trump himself has not publicly addressed geoengineering, his budget proposals make no mention of it, and none of his cabinet members has publicly endorsed it. Neither Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt nor Paul Dabbar, the Energy Department’s undersecretary for science, responded to requests for comment.</P><P>Nevertheless, said Harvard University physics professor David Keith, “there’s much more broad support for this than there was just two years ago.”</P><P>Keith, who wrote a 2013 book, “A Case for <mark>Climate</mark> Engineering,” leads one of the world’s most advanced and closely watched geoengineering research projects. Later this year, his <A href=""https://keith.seas.harvard.edu/david-keith-and-solar-geoengineering"" target=""_blank"">team</A> plans to conduct its first outdoor trial, launching a slow-moving balloon over Tucson, Arizona, to disperse substances such as calcium <mark>carbon</mark>ate dust or sulfur dioxide to reflect the sun’s rays back into space. The scientists believe this approach, known as solar radiation management, could mimic the <mark>climate</mark>-cooling effect of a volcano such as the Philippines’ Mount Pinatubo, whose eruption in 1991 caused a temporary global drop in temperatures of about 1 degree Fahrenheit. Keith <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/magazine/is-it-ok-to-engineer-the-environment-to-fight-<mark>climate</mark>-change.html"" target=""_blank"">estimates</A> full-scale deployment would cost about $1 billion a year.</P><P>The increasing interest in geoengineering, including from <mark>climate change</mark> skeptics, owes partly to growing <A href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/<mark>climate</mark>-may-be-15-warmer-than-previously-thought-by-2100-2017-12"" target=""_blank"">pessimism</A> about humanity’s capacity—and political will—to ward off the worst effects of <mark>climate change</mark> without some major technological breakthrough. <mark>Microsoft Corp.</mark> founder <A href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2010/01/bill-gates-funding-geoengineering-research"" target=""_blank"">Bill Gates</A> has invested both in Keith’s research and in a for-profit <A href=""http://<mark>carbon</mark>engineering.com/"" target=""_blank"">company</A> Keith founded to try to capture <mark>carbon</mark> from the atmosphere. In 2015, two major US environmental groups, the <A href=""https://www.edf.org/<mark>climate</mark>/our-position-geoengineering"" target=""_blank"">Environmental Defense Fund</A> and the <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/media/2015/150210"" target=""_blank"">Natural Resources Defense Council</A>, supported small-scale research into projects that one writer has dubbed “<A href=""https://www.npr.org/books/titles/138090460/hack-the-planet-sciences-best-hope-or-worst-nightmare-for-averting-<mark>climate</mark>-catas"" target=""_blank"">hacking the planet</A>.”</P><P>Several Trump allies are considerably more gung-ho, with some explicitly portraying geoengineering as a cheap alternative to radically transforming a US economy that is still about <A href=""https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=21912"" target=""_blank"">80 percent dependent</A> on fossil fuels.</P><P>“Instead of forcing unworkable and costly government mandates on the American people, we should look to technology and <mark>innovation</mark> to lead the way to address <mark>climate change</mark>,” Rep. Lamar Smith chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, said at last fall’s hearing.</P><P>Smith, a Texas Republican and Trump stalwart heavily <A href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/industries?cycle=Career&amp;cid=N00001811&amp;type=I"" target=""_blank"">backed</A> by the fossil fuel industry, has been one of the most aggressive <mark>climate</mark> science skeptics in Congress. Yet at the hearing, he called for more research into geoengineering, saying, “Some scientists believe it could achieve substantial environmental benefits at a cheaper cost than regulations.”</P><P>Likewise, former GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a devoted ally of Trump’s who has portrayed <mark>climate change</mark> as the left wing’s “<A href=""https://www.politico.com/story/2011/05/gingrich-recalls-global-cooling-055848"" target=""_blank"">newest excuse to take control of lives</A>,” has also praised <A href=""http://humanevents.com/2008/06/03/stop-the-green-pig-defeat-the-boxerwarnerlieberman-green-pork-bill-capping-american-jobs-and-trading-americas-future/"" target=""_blank"">geoengineering</A> for its “promise of addressing global warming concerns for just a few billion dollars a year.”</P><P>Attorney David Schnare, a Trump transition appointee at the EPA who has since left the administration, has challenged mainstream <mark>climate</mark> science and <A href=""https://www.buzzfeed.com/danvergano/trump-transition-lawyer-has-spent-years-suing-for-<mark>climate</mark>-em?utm_term=.gwZV3mj5L#.vwM6v5YRA"" target=""_blank"">filed lawsuits</A> seeking access to <mark>climate</mark> scientists’ emails, while championing <A href=""http://www.academia.edu/9864788/<mark>Climate</mark>_Change_and_the_Uncomfortable_Middle_Ground_The_Geoengineering_and_No_Regrets_Policy_Alternative"" target=""_blank"">geoengineering</A> as “a means to put off the most catastrophic potential effects” of global warming.</P><P>For several years, conservative think tanks, including the American Enterprise Institute, the Hoover Institution and The Heartland Institute, have taken a similarly paradoxical position, challenging established <mark>climate</mark> science while promoting geoengineering. Scholars working for the American Enterprise Institute’s Geoengineering Project have <A href=""http://www.aei.org/events/geoengineering-a-revolutionary-approach-to-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"" target=""_blank"">touted the strategy</A> as “a revolutionary approach to <mark>climate change</mark>.”</P><H3>‘Howlingly barking mad’</H3><P>Over the past several years, scientists and entrepreneurs throughout the world have proposed more than a dozen different kinds of geoengineering projects. One would send 16 trillion <A href=""http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160425-how-a-giant-space-umbrella-could-stop-global-warming"" target=""_blank"">tiny robots into space</A> to deflect the sun’s rays from the Earth.

The “<A href=""http://www.mcbproject.org/"" target=""_blank"">cloud-brightening</A>” scheme praised by Weber last fall envisions shooting salt water into marine clouds to improve their reflective power.</P><P>These aren’t even the most radical ideas.

And in a widely condemned operation in 2012, a rogue California businessman conducted the world’s <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/15/pacific-iron-fertilisation-geoengineering"" target=""_blank"">largest geoengineering project</A> to date by dumping 100 tons of iron dust into the Pacific Ocean. His goal was to fertilize plankton to absorb <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and then sell “credits” to fossil fuel firms.</P><P>Solar radiation management proposals, such as the cloud-brightening strategy and the Harvard aerosol-spraying plan, have attracted the most interest from US politicians, even as they’ve caused alarm among leading <mark>climate</mark> scientists.</P><P>“The idea of ‘fixing’ the <mark>climate</mark> by hacking the Earth’s reflection of sunlight is wildly, utterly, howlingly barking mad,” Oxford University physics professor Raymond Pierrehumbert <A href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2015/02/nrc_geoengineering_report_<mark>climate</mark>_hacking_is_dangerous_and_barking_mad.html"" target=""_blank"">wrote</A> in a 2015 Slate article. He was a lead author of the Nobel Prize-winning Third Assessment Report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>.</P><P>In an interview, Pierrehumbert compared such strategies with “jumping off the Washington Monument and hoping somebody invents anti-gravity before you hit the ground.”</P><P>He and other scientists say large-scale spraying of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, as envisioned by Harvard’s Keith, could deplete the ozone layer, harm some plants and animals, and benefit some countries while causing droughts in others, stirring <A href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/s/522676/the-geopolitics-of-geoengineering/"" target=""_blank"">global conflict</A> akin to nuclear rivalries. Furthermore, barring radical cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, such projects, once begun, might have to be continued indefinitely to prevent worse warming than before, a phenomenon known as the termination effect.</P><P>An additional danger, which Keith himself has <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/10/30/david-keith-explains-why-geoengineering-isnt-as-crazy-as-it-sounds/?utm_term=.65c487c547fd"" target=""_blank"">cited</A>, stems from geoengineering’s potential “moral hazard,” an insurance industry term that refers to how people behave more recklessly when they know they have a fallback. In other words, the promise of geoengineering might convince politicians that they need not worry about reforming our energy economy.</P><P>“If we don’t cut emissions, we’re sunk, and it would be criminal if people use this as an excuse to avoid that,” Keith said in an interview with Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting.</P><P>This is precisely what worries Janos Pasztor, former UN assistant secretary-general for <mark>climate change</mark>, who has been leading a <A href=""https://www.carnegiecouncil.org/programs/ccgg"" target=""_blank"">new global effort</A> to improve public discussion and governance of geoengineering proposals. He said the House hearing last fall “sent the wrong signal to the world,” noting that it took place just as world leaders were meeting at the UN’s annual <mark>climate change</mark> conference to discuss ways to lower greenhouse gases.</P><P>“At the very same time, US politicians were talking about stopping all these activities that could make a difference and talking about geoengineering, as if it’s some sort of a plan B,” Pasztor said. “It’s not a plan B. Maybe it could give us some time, but it’s not a solution.”</P><H3>Boots on the ice</H3><P>Field, the Ice911 founder, says she’s also concerned that the promise of a geoengineering fix might sap political will to cut emissions. Yet that hasn’t deterred her from joining other scientists and entrepreneurs rushing into the leadership vacuum.</P><P>“I don’t want Ice911 to be an excuse for building another coal mine,” she said. “But we have to do something. Our backs are up against the wall.”</P><P>Field, an inventor with 53 patents, began her research with buckets of cold water on the front deck of her home in Portola Valley, California, where she tested a variety of materials, including hay and daisies, to see how well they could prevent the sun’s rays from raising water temperatures. After settling on silica, she scaled up her experiments with trials on ice in California’s Sierra Nevada and on Canada’s Miquelon Lake.</P><P>Along the way, she raised funds from private donors, the largest contribution being a three-year, $1.3 million grant from a family foundation she heard about from a wealthy friend with whom she volunteered at her sons’ school. The money has helped pay for land-use permits and logistical support from <A href=""http://uicalaska.com/our-lands/science-support/"" target=""_blank"">Ukpeaġvik Iñupiat Corp.</A>, an indigenous-run organization in Barrow, Alaska. In May, Field and a small group of volunteers used an agricultural spreader, dragged by a snowmobile, to cover an area of ice the size of three football fields on an inland lake in Alaska.</P><P>Next week, Field plans to dispatch a buoy into the Arctic Ocean to monitor sea ice, and then return next month to try dispersing more sand on lake ice. She has not yet secured permits to perform tests on sea ice.</P><P>“Ice911 is the boots on the ground solution acting now to ease <mark>climate change</mark> by restoring Arctic ice,” reads Field’s fundraising pamphlet, what she conceded in an interview was an overstatement. Ice911 has yet to have any impact on <mark>climate change</mark>. Before that can happen, she said, she needs to build credibility for her approach, which has yet to win respect from the so-called <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/05/clique-geoengineering-debate"" target=""_blank"">geo-clique</A>—a small group of North American scientists who advise politicians and large funders.</P><P>Among Field’s harshest critics is Ken Caldeira, an atmospheric scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science’s Department of Global Ecology at Stanford University, who has collaborated with Keith and <A href=""https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Year-in-Review-2016"" target=""_blank"">worked with Bill Gates</A>. Caldeira dismissed Ice911 as unrealistic.</P><P>“This isn’t anything anyone is going to do,” Caldeira said. “It’s hard to do, not that effective, and you’d have to do it over millions of acres.”</P><P>Field disputes this. She said she recently hired <mark>climate</mark> modelers who she said assured her that Ice911 could lower Arctic temperatures by placing her sand in limited, strategic locations, such as the Fram Strait between Greenland and Svalbard.</P><P>“We’re working to simply restore an ecosystem that has a profound effect on the planet’s weather patterns,” she said. “That’s a lot better than putting a known pollutant into our one and only atmosphere.”</P><P>Harvard’s Keith, whom Time magazine honored in 2009 as a “<A href=""http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1924149_1924154_1924428,00.html"" target=""_blank"">hero of the environment</A>,” gives voice, often simultaneously, to the world’s fears and hopes for geoengineering. In the span of a single conversation with comedian and TV host <A href=""https://www.metabunk.org/david-keith-on-colbert-discussing-geoengineering.t2798/"" target=""_blank"">Stephen Colbert</A> in 2013, he called geoengineering “ugly” and “horrifying” but also said, “It might actually save people and be useful.”</P><P>Many scientists warn that the longer politicians ignore other strategies, the more likely society eventually will need to make the hard choice to try geoengineering. Still, Keith said he is unnerved by <mark>climate change</mark> skeptics’ recent embrace of geoengineering.</P><P>“In some ways,” Keith said <A href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609379/why-this-geoengineering-pioneers-worst-nightmare-is-a-trump-tweet/"" target=""_blank"">at a conference last fall</A>, “the thing we fear the most is a tweet from Trump, saying, ‘Solar geoengineering solves everything! It’s great! We don’t need to bother to cut emissions.’”</P></DIV><DIV class=""related-cne-video-component""><H4 class=""related-cne-video-component__brow""> Related Video</H4><DIV class=""related-cne-video-component__info""><SPAN class=""related-cne-video-component__cat"">Science</SPAN><H5 class=""related-cne-video-component__hed"">How <mark>Climate Change</mark> Is Already Affecting Earth</H5><P class=""related-cne-video-component__dek"">Though the planet has only warmed by one-degree Celsius since the Industrial Revolution, <mark>climate change</mark>'s effect on earth has been anything but subtle.

	Look, if it was any other issue, it would be a no-brainer for politicians all along the ideological spectrum. In almost every other area, society works on something like a “You break it. You buy it.” principle where those responsible for damaging something are the ones responsible for the tab. Except, it seems, when it comes to the <mark>climate</mark> crisis.
</P><P>
	Sure, <mark>climate change</mark> is an enormous and complex problem. One without any single silver bullet solution. But we know that some pretty basic and commonsense policy tools like <mark>carbon</mark> pricing – if done right and fairly – can make a real dent in emissions and trigger exactly the kind of broader cultural changes we need if we’re going to solve the crisis.
</P><P>
	Right now, the stakes couldn’t be clearer. After all, just look at the horrifying destruction left by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in the past month. Then listen to all the scientists telling us that <mark>climate change</mark> is likely making these storms all the worse. Because, when you do, the question you have to ask isn’t “Should we be pricing <mark>carbon</mark>?”
</P><P><EM>It’s “Why aren’t we?”</EM> </P><P>
	So how does <mark>carbon</mark> pricing work? Who’s using it and how’s it’s been working out? Read on.
</P><H3><STRONG>What Is <mark>Carbon</mark> Pricing?</STRONG></H3><P>
	When entire cities are flooded, farms dry out, or wildfires burn through forests and communities usually thanks in part to <mark>climate change</mark>, there is often a long – and costly – recuperation and rebuilding period. Infrastructure needs repairing or rebuilding. Homes may be damaged or destroyed, and although the federal government usually steps in to help financially, the cost of the recovery is paid for through higher taxes, government borrowing, and insurance rates. Not to mention the medical bills that fall on families affected.
</P><P>
	But even as regular people spend years rebuilding their lives after <mark>climate</mark> events, the companies responsible for the majority of the <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> driving them – think Big Oil – aren’t the ones picking up the bill. Even though they’re also sitting at the top of the list of the world’s most profitable firms. </P><H3><STRONG>Which leads us to</STRONG><STRONG><mark>carbon</mark> pricing.</STRONG></H3><P>
	We know that the public costs of burning fossil fuels are enormous, but the market prices of <mark>carbon</mark>-intensive products and services don’t reflect that reality. Government subsidies for the fossil fuel industry and lack of accountability for <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> allow market prices for these products to stay artificially low, effectively telling polluters that they are free to dump unlimited <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> into the atmosphere without any consequences.
</P><P>
	There are two main types of <mark>carbon</mark> pricing: emissions trading systems (often referred to as ETSs) and <mark>carbon</mark> taxing. For an in-depth and practical analysis of the various pricing mechanisms, their design considerations, and the advantages and disadvantages associated with each, <STRONG><A href=""https://www.<mark>climate</mark>realityproject.org/content/download-<mark>climate</mark>-reality-<mark>carbon</mark>-pricing-handbook"" target=""_blank"">download the <EM><mark>Climate</mark> Reality <mark>Carbon</mark> Pricing Handbook.</EM></A></STRONG></P><P>
	Policies that put a price on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions aim to re-adjust the market to better reflect the true cost of <mark>carbon</mark> and shift that cost to the polluter. The good news is that policies, like <mark>carbon</mark> taxes or “cap-and-trade” programs, <STRONG>have already been adopted in a number of countries around the globe.</STRONG></P><H3><STRONG>So Who Uses It?</STRONG></H3><P>
	<mark>Carbon</mark> pricing policies have been taking shape on various levels, from individual states in the US to multinational regions (like the EU) around the world. Even some corporations are using internal <mark>carbon</mark> pricing strategies on their own.
</P><P><A href=""http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/pricing-<mark>carbon</mark>"" target=""_blank"">More than 40 nations</A> around the world have implemented or are in the process of planning or implementing a <mark>carbon</mark> pricing initiative. Among them, some of the world’s strongest economies, including China, Australia, Brazil, and Canada. The European Union (EU) has adopted <mark>carbon</mark> pricing as a cornerstone of its <mark>climate</mark> efforts through the EU ETS cap-and-trade system. This system includes all 28 EU countries, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.

	Many states in the US have also implemented their own <mark>carbon</mark> pricing policies. US states like California have enacted statewide policies, <A href=""https://www.rggi.org/"" target=""_blank"">while nine states in the Northeast have joined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative</A>, the first mandatory market-based program in the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.
</P><P>
	Some corporations have even developed <mark>carbon</mark> pricing mechanisms to mitigate risks associated with the <mark>climate</mark> crisis, de<mark>carbon</mark>ize and reduce greenhouse gas footprints, prepare for a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy, and increase operational efficiency.  As of 2016, more than 1,200 companies globally report that they have internalized or plan to internalize <mark>carbon</mark> pricing. Among those are 210 US companies, including big names like <mark>Microsoft Corpo</mark>ration, Walt Disney Company, and General Motors Company.
</P><H3><STRONG>Does It Work?</STRONG></H3><P>
	So if all these policies have been implemented, how do we know if it’s working?

Packaged software was on the decline. Customers were increasingly doing their computing on remote servers. So the company planned a big expansion of its cloud-computing services.</P><P>But that created another issue, said sustainability chief T.J. DiCaprio: “We realized our energy consumption was going to be increasing significantly as we built data centers.”</P><P>More energy meant more <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions. But, like others in the tech industry, Microsoft pledged to be <mark>carbon</mark>-neutral. The challenge to reduce the impact of data centers was getting business managers on board.</P><P>DiCaprio said that meant speaking their language, and shifting &quot;from speaking about metric tons of <mark>carbon</mark>, which is a nebulous concept for the business people. It was much more direct to speak in terms of a dollar per metric ton and a charge on their profit-and-loss statement.”</P><P>So the company began tallying how much electricity their data centers consumed, multiplying that by how much <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide the power plants would produce and charging managers a fee per ton.</P><P>With a <mark>carbon</mark> tax on their balance sheets, DiCaprio said, managers found ways to cut energy use, like reducing server idling time and cooling data centers with more fresh air.</P><P>“That’s the beauty of this model with the price signal,&quot; she said. &quot;It helps the managers understand that driving efficiency is critical.”</P><P><STRONG>Major energy savings</STRONG></P><P>Efficiency improvements were paid for with funds from the <mark>carbon</mark> tax. Microsoft has collected $30 million in the program’s first three years. It cut its <mark>carbon</mark> footprint by 7.5 million metric tons and saved more than $10 million a year in energy costs.</P><P>The company’s <mark>carbon</mark> tax also paid for planting trees in developing countries and other programs like providing efficient cookstoves that reduce firewood demand.</P><P>DiCaprio said almost no one seems to mind paying. Rather, employees are excited that the company shows environmental responsibility.</P><P>“I’m pleasantly surprised that the response from the managers has been so positive,” she said.</P><P>Microsoft is among the more than 1,000 corporations worldwide that have adopted internal <mark>carbon</mark> taxes or plan to in the next two years, according to a recent report.</P><P>Several energy companies are on that list. Although they don’t pay for their <mark>carbon</mark> emissions in the United States, they do in other countries.
And companies expect more will require it in the future, said Eliot Metzger of the World Resources Institute, an environmental research group.</P><P>“I think they’ve seen the writing on the wall and they recognize that this is a huge issue that’s going to affect their future markets,&quot; he said. &quot;And they have to find a way to prepare for that.”</P><P>Internal <mark>carbon</mark> taxes can help them identify the most cost-effective ways to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, he said, before governments do it for them.</P></DIV><UL><LI><DIV class=""c-author c-author--hlight""><DIV class=""small-thums-list""><DIV class=""media-block horizontal has-img""><DIV><H4 class=""media-block__title media-block__title--author""><A href=""/author/4446.html"">Steve Baragona</A></H4><DIV class=""wsw""><P>Steve Baragona is an award-winning multimedia journalist covering science, environment and health.</P><P>He spent eight years in molecular biology and infectious disease research before deciding that writing about science was more fun than doing it.

But beyond self-reported, voluntary measures, experts say holding them to account is nearly impossible</B><B>.</B></P><P class=""p3""><mark>Climate change</mark> is now ingrained in corporate culture at many firms, a marked departure from the greenwashing of the 1990s and 2000s when companies appointed largely token sustainability chiefs. That’s important given the popular narrative that big businesses will play an outsized <mark>climate</mark> role after president Donald Trump said he would <A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>changenews.com/2017/06/01/us-leaves-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-agreement-wants-come-back/"">pull the US out of the Paris accord</A>.</P><P class=""p3"">Companies like Apple, Google, IBM and Amazon all pushed Trump to remain in Paris and have since joined <A href=""http://wearestillin.com"" target=""_blank"">We Are Still In</A>, a coalition of businesses, cities and states that will still adhere to the Paris targets, many having announced lofty emissions-curbing pledges, commitments to <mark>sustainable</mark> sourcing and promises to reduce water consumption.</P><P class=""p3"">Much of that may amount to good publicity for the largest multinational firms most affected by public opinion, but there’s scant few ways to hold the private sector accountable for information. And in the private sector writ large, there’s very little emphasis on sustainability, especially when it comes to energy-intensive industries, said Cynthia Cummis, director of private sector <mark>climate</mark> mitigation at the World Resources Institute.</P><P class=""p3"">“It’s still just the top couple hundred companies,” Cummis said. “It’s still not standard practice to take a leadership position on sustainability.”</P><P class=""p3"">Companies sometimes disingenuously report emissions reductions in corporate sustainability reports, said Gary Cook, a corporate campaigner for Greenpeace. He said Apple, for instance, is 100% renewable at facilities in the US and 23 other countries, but about four-fifths of its emissions come from its manufacturing supply chain.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P class=""p3""><A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>changenews.com/newsletter-sign-up/""><STRONG><mark>Climate</mark> Weekly:</STRONG> Sign up for your essential <mark>climate</mark> news update</A></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P class=""p3"">Amazon and Amazon Web Services document how much renewable power they add but refuse to share data on their net emissions – for a company that’s constantly growing, it’s unlikely the additional megawatts of renewable power match its increasing emissions despite Amazon Web Services’ goal of being 100% renewable. (Amazon did not return a request for comment.)</P><P class=""p3"">Of the myriad reporting standards and fora that exist – which businesses say can be confusing for them and the public – none offer much detail on how companies account for their shares of renewable power. That’s critical, as it relates directly to perception and how much company actions actually reduce emissions. While many view the <A href=""https://www.cdp.net/en"" target=""_blank""><mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project</A> as an admirable floor for reporting, it’s not very user friendly and free downloads of the numerous company reports are limited, Cook said.</P><P class=""p3"">One common practice companies employ to distort how much renewable energy they’re getting is by purchasing renewable energy credits (RECs). But not all RECs are created equal – some correspond to drawing power from the same regional grid in which the credit purchaser is located, but in other cases the power source may be distant. Those latter RECs, which are called “unbundled”, are at the heart of what many <mark>climate</mark> advocates see as a misrepresentation of the private sector’s record on <mark>climate</mark>. Critics call it an accounting trick that allows well-heeled companies to siphon off already existing renewable energy rather than compelling new additions to the electric grid.</P><P class=""p3"">“A lot of people are simply buying RECs and saying they’re doing the right thing here,” said Tim Mohin, chief executive with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), a standards-setting body used by the private sector to compare sustainability efforts. “You see that typically in companies like Google, Apple, Facebook that have massive data consumption.”</P><P class=""p3"">Mohin said GRI and other standards try to limit REC abuse by setting grid location restraints. Having spent years on sustainability teams at Intel and Apple, Mohin said he knows companies especially in the IT sector with its energy-gobbling data centers and sprawling manufacturing operations, rely on RECs as a quick fix to boost renewable power pledges. He described renewable energy accounting as “really sensitive” and that “how people count their contribution to <mark>climate change</mark> hasn’t been settled”.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P class=""p3""><A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>changenews.com/2017/05/31/exxon-shareholders-win-historic-vote-<mark>climate</mark>-transparency/""><STRONG>Report:</STRONG> Exxon shareholders win ‘historic’ <mark>climate</mark> vote against board’s advice</A></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P class=""p3"">Added Wayne Balta, vice president of environmental affairs at IBM: “If IBM is going to talk about how much renewable energy IBM uses, we are going to be transparent in that purchasing an unbundled REC is not the same as using electricity. It’s not an opinion; it’s a statement of fact.”</P><P class=""p3"">Still, companies are increasingly moving away from accounting trickery as awareness and pressure from investors strengthens.</P><P class=""p3"">A task force of financial institutions and large companies working with the Financial Stability Board, a body of regulators led by former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-<mark>climate</mark>change-financial-disclosure-idUSKBN19K0JW"" target=""_blank"">released a report on 29 June </A>that called for more disclosure on how <mark>climate change</mark> would affect businesses and what firms are doing to address rising emissions.</P><P class=""p3"">Firms like Vanguard and BlackRock are advising the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, a sectoral reporting approach working with GRI. Mohin added socially responsible investing has moved from “fringe” to “mainstream”, citing an <A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>changenews.com/2017/05/31/exxon-shareholders-win-historic-vote-<mark>climate</mark>-transparency/"">ExxonMobil shareholder resolution</A> to disclose <mark>climate</mark> risks that got two-thirds approval even against management’s recommendation. And 63% of Fortune 100 and nearly half of Fortune 500 companies have <A href=""https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/repo""><SPAN class=""s1"">set at least one <mark>climate</mark> or clean energy target</SPAN></A>.</P><P class=""p3"">Progress also is expanding across the supply chain. Companies like Microsoft have moved away from using unbundled RECs (the company says it’s been <mark>carbon</mark> neutral since 2012, but critics contend it was plugging the gap with RECs) – it deploys revenues from its internal <mark>carbon</mark> fee to fund green projects and purchase clean energy across the globe.</P><P class=""p3"">Timberland audits its suppliers regularly, with performance shared on the company’s quarterly corporate sustainability report, Colleen Vien, the firm’s sustainability director, said in an email. Apple is considered a leader in getting its supply chain to go <mark>carbon</mark> neutral, at least for the portions of their operations devoted to making Apple products. The company has pledged to bring 4 gigawatts of renewable energy for manufacturers online by 2020, with 2 gigawatts already committed.</P><P class=""p3"">“[T]his is not about cheap unbundled RECs,” an Apple employee said in an email. “This is about working with suppliers to bring new energy sources online, purchase from existing sources.”</P><DIV class=""yarpp-related""><H3>Related posts:</H3></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"

Intel Corporation believes that global <mark>climate change</mark> is a<SPAN class=""pdf-ellipses"">...</SPAN><SPAN class=""hidden-content""> serious environmental, economic, and social challenge that warrants an equally serious response by governments and the private sector. By its nature, <mark>climate change</mark> is a global problem that defies simple “silver bullet” solutions or contributions by a narrow group of countries or a few industry sectors. Addressing <mark>climate change</mark> requires leadership, both by individual governments and companies. Intel exercises leadership both in reducing our own footprint and in working with others to influence the development of sound public policies. With respect to reducing our own footprint, we take seriously the work of the UN-affiliated Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC). The IPCC, in its 2007 Fourth Assessment Report, estimated that in order to stabilize <mark>CO2</mark> emissions in the atmosphere at 450 parts per million (ppm) in 2050 (a goal that many <mark>climate change</mark> experts have advocated), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions need to be reduced by 85% compared to levels observed in our own GHG emissions reduction progress against that benchmark. See the Addendum of this document for information on our progress to date.

Third, it uses the fund to drive internal and external <mark>climate</mark>-related energy and technology <mark>innovation</mark>.

						Microsoft is expanding its &quot;AI for Earth&quot; program with a $50 million investment over the next five years. This could yield new artificial intelligence applications to enable scientists, businesses, and even farmers to better protect the environment.					</DIV><DIV class=""summary module""><H2>An AI Investment</H2><P>The tech giant Microsoft is deploying artificial intelligence to the task of protecting our planet.  Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president and chief legal officer, <A href=""https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/12/11/ai-for-earth-can-be-a-game-changer-for-our-planet/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">announced on Dec. 11</A> that the company would be investing $50 million in their <A href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/aiforearth"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">AI for Earth</A> program over the next five years in order to “monitor, model, and manage the Earth’s natural systems.”</P><P>This investment is part of Microsoft’s expansion of its environmental policies, which center around <A href=""https://futurism.com/microsoft-announces-its-new-open-source-machine-learning-tools/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">the concept of democratizing AI</A> so that both scientists and business owners can easily utilize the technology to analyze <mark>climate</mark> data and provide information to help us take strategic action. Smith suggested in the announcement that AI could soon be used to collect and analyze data about energy consumption and weather patterns to conserve power and reduce needless water usage in agriculture.</P><FIGURE style=""width: 781px"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">Image Credit: Microsoft</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>“AI can be trained to classify raw data from sensors on the ground, in the sky, or in space into categories that both humans and computers understand,” Smith said <A href=""https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/12/11/ai-for-earth-can-be-a-game-changer-for-our-planet/"">in the announcement.</A>“Fundamentally, AI can accelerate our ability to observe environmental systems and how they are changing at a global scale, convert the data into useful information, and apply that information to take concrete steps to better manage our natural resources.”</P><H2>Better Tools</H2><P>The expansion of AI for Earth will take place in three steps: First, Microsoft will award researchers worldwide with more seed grants for designing and testing new AI applications. The company will then identify applications with the most promise and bring them to scale with larger investments. Finally, Microsoft will incorporate the most useful applications into the services they can provide to <mark>climate</mark> scientists and those involved with <mark>sustainable</mark> initiatives.</P><P>These new services and tools could not only help conservationists make sense of <A href=""https://futurism.com/heres-what-real-<mark>climate</mark>-scientists-have-to-say-about-global-warming/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">the mountains of <mark>climate</mark> data</A> that we’ve collected and <A href=""https://futurism.com/data-shows-summers-are-now-either-hot-or-extremely-hot-compared-to-50-years-ago/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">continue to accumulate</A> but also help companies and even farmers take control of the impact they make on our environment.</P><P>As <A href=""https://futurism.com/us-officially-only-country-world-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-agreement/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">every nation in the world— save the U.S.</A>—publicly recognizes that <A href=""https://futurism.com/al-gores-an-inconvenient-sequel-is-here-and-we-need-it-more-than-ever/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">human behavior must change</A> in order to preserve the environment, companies like Microsoft are embracing the idea that the more information individuals at every level of society have about their personal sustainability practices, the better they will be able to modify them for the better.</P><P>“We face a collective need for urgent action to address global <mark>climate</mark> issues. When we think about the environmental issues we face today, science tells us that many are the product of previous Industrial Revolutions,” Smith said in the announcement. “…we must not only move technology forward, but also use this era’s technology to clean up the past and create a better future.”</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Operated by Renovate America, the HERO Program is a Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing program that partners with local governments to make energy-efficient, water-saving, and renewable energy products more accessible for homeowners. PACE, enacted by California legislation, provides 100 percent financing at rates competitive to a home equity line of credit for projects that save energy and water. Since the projects are permanently affixed to the home and financed through local property taxes, any remaining balance may be able to be transferred to a buyer if the home is sold. The program empowers local governments to create more <mark>sustainable</mark>, healthy and prosperous communities through reducing energy and water use, increasing installation of renewables, stimulating the local economy, creating jobs and reducing GHG emissions.</P><P>The Government Authorities for the Home Energy Renovation Opportunity (HERO) Program are being recognized for a <mark>Climate</mark> Leadership Award—Innovative Partnerships Certificate—for the following accomplishments:</P><UL><LI>While more than 370 municipalities play key roles in guiding HERO at the local level, three government partners—Western Riverside Council of Governments, San Bernardino Associated Governments, and County of Los Angeles, CA—are fundamental to the program’s operation, as they developed and brought to market the California HERO Program. The partners took on significant roles to address <mark>climate change</mark> issues, and the challenges facing property owners at a time when the housing crisis was impacting their communities. </LI><LI>The main partners formed a Joint Powers Authority (JPA) in 2014 so that other local governments could join the program and have it benefit their communities. </LI><LI>The partners provide key input that continues to guide and shape the partnership, including development of comprehensive consumer protections, crafting eligible product guidelines, and adjusting program policies in response to market feedback as well as establishing PACE as a key tool for local government in achieving local <mark>climate</mark> action goals. </LI><LI>By utilizing the JPA and local government process, HERO has expanded across California, now representing 372 communities and over 85 percent of the housing units in California.</LI><LI>The projects financed through the HERO Program, as of February 1, 2016, have resulted in the creation of more than 10,000 jobs in California and will realize more than 2.16 million tons in reduced emissions and more than 3 billion gallons in conserved water.</LI><LI>The California HERO program is now the largest and most successful PACE program in the United States, accounting for approximately 90 percent of all PACE assessments.</LI></UL><P>Key partnership members include:</P><UL><LI>Western Riverside Council of Governments</LI><LI>San Bernardino Associated Governments</LI><LI>County of Los Angeles, CA</LI><LI>Renovate America</LI></UL><P><STRONG>King County-Cities <mark>Climate</mark> Collaboration (Washington State)</STRONG></P><P>In 2011, King County, Washington and nine cities founded the King County-Cities <mark>Climate</mark> Collaboration (K4C) in recognition that neighboring local governments can achieve greater action on <mark>climate</mark> solutions by working together.

Microsoft wants to take responsibility for that global impact even if the U.S. government no longer does.</P><P>Other Washington state companies, too, are thinking this way. The movement picked up steam when President Donald Trump announced he would pull America out of the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement, with <A href=""http://wearestillin.com/"">Microsoft, Amazon and Starbucks all pledging their support for ambitious, if unspecified, <mark>climate</mark> action</A> to meet the terms of the agreement.</P><P>Microsoft had lobbied Trump to stay in the Paris agreement. It also pushed the White House, unsuccessfully, to keep President Obama’s Clean Power Plan. </P><P>The company’s efforts on behalf of the <mark>climate</mark> predate the Trump administration. Since 2012, the tech giant has slapped a <mark>carbon</mark> tax on itself to push everything it does in a <mark>climate</mark>-friendly direction. This April, it negotiated a divorce from Puget Sound Energy so its suburban-Seattle office campuses can run on power that isn’t made from coal.</P><P>That deal would allow Microsoft, currently Puget Sound Energy’s largest customer, to buy power directly from clean-energy providers.

That unspecified point in the future may be too late for a livable <mark>climate</mark>; scientists say the world needs deep cuts in fossil fuel starting now.</P><P>Microsoft data centers in eastern Washington run mostly on <mark>carbon</mark>-neutral hydropower, but still get some power from coal, according to the Grant County Public Utility District. They also ran their backup diesel generators for nearly a month last year, according to state regulators — enough to add 2 tons of diesel soot to the air above rural Quincy, Washington.</P><P>In the short term, Microsoft aims to get half its power worldwide from wind, solar and hydropower by the end of next year. While that goal is only half as ambitious as Google’s all-renewables-this-year plan, it is more ambitious than many states or nations.</P><P>Bernard said lowering Microsoft’s dependence on dirty energy has been good for business.</P><P>PACCAR, the fifth largest company in Washington state, said the same, though it has been much less politically active on the issue than Microsoft, and it has not fully disclosed its emissions. </P><P>The big-truck manufacturer has taken no position on Trump’s withdrawal from the global <mark>climate</mark> agreement<EM>.</EM></P><P><STRONG>Quiet company, loud products</STRONG></P><P>The low-profile company has been around for more than a century, and employees at PACCAR Tower in Bellevue still wear suits to work. “It is very traditional,” said Ken Hastings, who handles investor and media relations at PACCAR. “We do dress in business attire.”</P><P>Eighteen-wheelers tend to get about 6 miles a gallon, meaning they burn a lot of diesel and put out a lot of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide.</P><P>“We continually make improvements in fuel efficiency,” Hastings said. “We're highly motivated to do that regardless of the regulatory environment.”</P><P>Manufacturers got an extra push last year to do more of that when the Obama administration raised efficiency requirements for heavy trucks.</P><P>Yet Hastings said it’s customers who push PACCAR to make greener trucks. For trucking companies, diesel is such a big share of costs that the firms are, um, driven to save energy.</P><P>“Whether diesel is at $2.50 or whether it's at $4, our customers are very motivated to reduce fuel costs,” he said. “Fuel costs are probably one third of their total operating cost.”</P><DIV class=""wysiwyg-asset-image-wrapper inset""><DIV class=""wysiwyg-asset-image""><DIV class=""image-meta""><DIV class=""caption"">Ken Hastings of PACCAR in front of one of its truck-themed conference rooms.</DIV><DIV class=""credit"">Credit KUOW Photo / John Ryan</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>There are <A href=""https://www.trucks.com/2017/04/26/epa-review-heavy-duty-truck-emissions-rules/"">indications</A> the Trump administration may try to undo Obama administration fuel economy rules for heavy trucks, as it is doing for cars. Hastings said a push for less regulation won’t affect what PACCAR does, one way or the other.</P><P>“If the government's needs change, we would still continue to develop more fuel efficient vehicles because that's what customers want,” he said.</P><P>Hastings said it’s not in the company’s DNA to be activist.</P><P>“It's part of our culture,” Hastings said. “We would rather win in the market than try to influence events through lobbying efforts.”</P><P>Congressional disclosures show that PACCAR does lobby in D.C., but much less than many corporate giants from our region. Microsoft, for example, spent 32 times more than PACCAR on federal lobbying last year.</P><P>“They’ve historically been more quiet when it comes to policy options,” Dave Cooke with the Union of Concerned Scientists, which lobbies for cleaner transportation, said of PACCAR.</P><P>The company’s politics as well as attire favor the conservative: It steers campaign contributions almost exclusively to Republican candidates, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. (Donations from Microsoft staff and political committees lean Democratic.)</P><P>The trucking industry and the environment have both benefited from federal subsidies for research into energy-saving “super trucks.”</P><P>PACCAR participated in the first round of the Obama administration’s Supertruck program, aimed at developing trucks with double the fuel efficiency of today’s rigs.</P><P>Hastings said some of the <mark>innovation</mark>s from the first Supertruck program, like aerodynamic wheel covers and lightweight materials, are already being used in PACCAR trucks today.</P><P>The Trump Administration’s federal budget for 2018 would slash funding for round two of the Supertruck program.</P><P>After Trump started dismantling U.S. efforts to protect the <mark>climate</mark>, many <mark>climate</mark> advocates and scientists expressed despair for the future.

On Monday, more than a dozen large companies announced a new partnership with the White House to expand renewable energy use and cut greenhouse gas emissions and water use. The companies, which also include Cargill, General Motors, Goldman Sachs, UPS and Walmart, agreed to back a strong international <mark>climate change</mark> agreement that is to be negotiated in Paris in early December. </P><P>The Paris talks are viewed as the last chance to limit manmade global warming to an upper limit of 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. By implication, the companies are also endorsing — or at least not objecting to — the Obama administration's own <mark>climate</mark> goals, which are to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28% by 2025 compared to 2005 levels.</P><P>&quot;No corner of the planet and no sector of the global economy will remain unaffected by <mark>climate change</mark> in the years ahead,&quot; the fact sheet states.</P><P>By signing the &quot;American Business Act on <mark>Climate</mark> pledge,&quot; the companies are voicing &quot;support for a strong outcome in the Paris <mark>climate</mark> negotiations,&quot; according to the White House. </P><P>The corporate support for <mark>climate change</mark> action could affect the <mark>climate</mark> talks in Paris, since this is a new, influential corporate dynamic on the international stage. The tech companies who have signed on today together represent $1.3 trillion in revenue, based on 2014 data, according to a <A href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/07/27/fact-sheet-white-house-launches-american-business-act-<mark>climate</mark>-pledge"" target=""_blank"">White House fact sheet</A>. </P><DIV class=""see-also""><P>See also: <A href=""http://mashable.com/2015/07/20/earth-warmest-june-warmest-year/"">Earth just had its warmest June on record, and warmest year so far</A></P></DIV><P>As part of the pledge, each company agreed to take additional action to reduce their emissions. </P><P>In sum, the announcements total &quot;at least $140 billion in low-<mark>carbon</mark> investment and more than 1,600 megawatts of new renewable energy,&quot; the White House said. </P><P>Apple, for example, which already runs all of its U.S. operations on renewable energy, said it will bring an additional 280 megawatts of &quot;clean power generation&quot; online by the end of 2016 through investments in several states as well as in Sichuan Province, China.</P><P>According to the White House, <SPAN class=""microcontent"" data-fragment=""apple-has-cut-<mark>carbon</mark>"" data-description=""Apple has cut <mark>carbon</mark> emissions from its global corporate facilities, data centers and retail stores by 48% since 2011."" data-micro=""1"">Apple has cut <mark>carbon</mark> emissions from its global corporate facilities, data centers and retail stores by 48% since 2011.</SPAN></P><P>Google has already committed to powering its operation with 100% renewable energy. Along those lines, it committed to tripling its renewable energy purchases by 2025. </P><P>As a company headquartered in bone dry California, Google pledged to cut its water use by 30% at its San Francisco Bay area headquarters in 2015, compared to a 2013 baseline. The company has been installing drought tolerant plants and using recycled water irrigation, among other measures, to cut water use.</P><P>&quot;We believe that by directly investing in renewable energy projects, we can help accelerate the shift to zero-<mark>carbon</mark> power and create a better future for everyone,&quot; the company said in the White House fact sheet.</P><P>As for Microsoft, the company also agreed with the increasingly popular tech sector pledge of purchasing 100% renewable energy for operating its data centers, offices, labs and manufacturing facilities. </P><P>The White House's business push comes during what is expected to be the hottest year on record globally, beating the record high set just last year. <A href=""https://mashable.com/2015/07/20/earth-warmest-june-warmest-year/"" target=""_blank"">June was the planet's hottest</A> such month since reliable instrument records began in 1880.

Coca Cola, for example, pledged to cut &quot;the <mark>carbon</mark> footprint of &quot;the drink in your hand&quot; by 25% by 2020. </P><P>Even Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street investment firm, pledged to achieve <mark>carbon</mark> neutrality &quot;across our operations and business travel&quot; starting this year and continuing thereafter. The company is also planning to purchase 100% renewable power for the company's electricity needs by 2020.</P><P>Alcoa, the aluminum manufacturing giant, pledged to cut its emissions by 50% in the U.S., compared to 2005 levels, by 2025. And Berkshire Hathaway Energy, an offshoot of billionaire Warren E. Buffet's investment firm, pledged up to $15 billion more for investments in renewable energy generation construction and operation. </P><P>In addition, Berkshire Hathaway Energy pledged to construct an addition 522 megawatts of new wind generation in Iowa and shut down more than 75% of the companies coal-fired power plants in Nevada by 2017.</P><P>Perhaps more importantly, the company pledged to invest in electrical transmission infrastructure in the West and Midwest, where most of the country's solar and wind generation takes place, to better integrate renewable energy into the country's electrical grid. </P><P><SPAN class=""microcontent"" data-fragment=""because-wind-and-solar"" data-description=""Because wind and solar are intermittent sources of power (the sun doesn't always shine, and the wind doesn't always blow), incorporating them into the standard electrical grid has its challenges."" data-micro=""1"">Because wind and solar are intermittent sources of power (the sun doesn't always shine, and the wind doesn't always blow), incorporating them into the standard electrical grid has its challenges.</SPAN></P><P>And Walmart, which is already one of the largest users of solar energy across the U.S. and most forward-thinking companies when it comes to cutting emissions from improving fuel efficiency and reforming product packaging practices,  pledged to increase its procurement of renewable energy globally by more than 600% compared to a 2010 baseline. This includes doubling the number of on-site solar energy projects at U.S. stores by 2020.</P><P>This marks a noteworthy departure from the state of <mark>climate</mark> treaty negotiations during the Obama administration's first year in office, when many companies feared cost increases from the <mark>climate</mark> agreement etched out in Copenhagen in 2009 and showed some resistance. </P><P>The White House is planning to announce a second round of pledges in the fall, &quot;with a goal of mobilizing many more companies to join.&quot; And Secretary of State John Kerry will hold a forum at the State Department in October to highlight U.S. actions on <mark>climate</mark> investments and solutions. </P><P>Kerry will be on hand to make the <mark>climate</mark> pledge announcements at the White House on Monday. </P><P>In its push for a strong Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement, the White House faces widespread and deep opposition in both houses of Congress, where many Republicans doubt the mainstream science findings on manmade global warming.</P></SECTION></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

To “capture and catalyze” these commitments, the UN Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, in conjunction with the government of Peru, launched the <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>action.unfccc.int/companyindustries.aspx"">Non-State Actor Zone for <mark>Climate Change</mark> (NAZCA)</A>. NAZCA is an online portal that showcases commitment to action by companies, investors, cities and subnational regions to address <mark>climate change</mark>. To date, more than 2,000 companies—from <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>action.unfccc.int/company/baosteel-group-corporation"">Baosteel Group Corporation </A>to<A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>action.unfccc.int/company/exxon-mobil-corporation""> Exxon Mobil Corporation </A>to <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>action.unfccc.int/company/taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing"">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing</A> to <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>action.unfccc.int/company/wal-mart-stores,-inc-"">Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.</A>—have made voluntary commitments to reduce emissions, increase energy use efficiencies and invest in renewable energy sources.</P><H2>IT sector stands out </H2><P>Proactive action by businesses to combat global <mark>climate change</mark> is not new. Over the past decade, businesses have increasingly engaged in voluntary <mark>climate</mark> action to share best practices, network, promote market mechanisms, and set greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Despite this, not all businesses are eager participants. <A href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2686728"">My recent paper on the role of the Global 500 companies in transnational <mark>climate</mark> governance</A> shows that, after controlling for political economic and institutional factors at the country level, global businesses operating in the information technology (IT) sector are twice as likely as other firms to engage in proactive <mark>climate</mark> action. Next to the consumer staples sector, the IT sector has the highest share of global companies engaging in proactive <mark>climate</mark> action compared to the energy, health care, industrials, materials and utilities sectors. </P><P>Among the notable IT companies worldwide that have taken proactive <mark>climate</mark> action, including public disclosures of their <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, are <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>action.unfccc.int/company/apple-inc-"">Apple Inc</A>., <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>action.unfccc.int/company/google-inc-"">Google Inc.</A>, <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>action.unfccc.int/company/hitachi,-ltd-"">Hitachi, Ltd.</A>, <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>action.unfccc.int/company/lg-innotek"">LG Innotek</A>, <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>action.unfccc.int/company/microsoft-corporation""><mark>Microsoft Corp.</mark></A>, <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>action.unfccc.int/company/ericsson"">Ericsson</A> and <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>action.unfccc.int/company/telefonica"">Telefonica</A>.</P><P>There are several reasons why IT companies are in a better position than other corporations to play a proactive role in <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation. First, IT companies, as a sector, tend to be wealthier, not only in terms of asset holdings but also profitability. They also employ a larger number of workers than other companies. Large and well-endowed corporations are better able to afford the costly investments necessary for deploying renewable energy and for undertaking <mark>carbon</mark> emissions management. According to my findings, wealthy corporations that employ a large number of workers have two to four time higher odds of proactive <mark>climate</mark> action than companies with smaller asset holdings and employee base.</P><H2>Complementary capabilities</H2><P>Second, my research also shows that, more often than not, when a company demonstrates a commitment to sustainability through complementary capabilities and competencies, namely investments in environmental R&amp;D and/or certification with the ISO 14001 environmental management standard, the odds are higher that the company also engages in voluntary <mark>climate</mark> action and <mark>carbon</mark> disclosure. For example, a larger share of companies in the IT sector (75 percent) are certified with the ISO 14001 environmental management standard than Global 500 companies excluding IT (54 percent). A similar pattern, albeit less pronounced, is also true of investments in environmental R&amp;D by IT companies compared to other global companies (56 percent versus 48 percent). </P><P>Wealth endowment and complementary capabilities aside, IT companies are more likely than other Global 500 companies to have an in-house managerial- or executive-level sustainability officer. Close to half of all IT companies have formally created a position of a vice president of sustainability or a chief sustainability officer compared to about 40 percent of other global businesses. These in-house champions of sustainability policies and initiatives play a critical role in helping to align corporate vision and allocate the necessary resources toward sustainability efforts. </P><P>Among the world’s largest companies by revenue, Apple Inc. (rank 15<SUP>th</SUP>)is a leader in proactive <mark>climate</mark> action: Apple has pledged to “maintain <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>action.unfccc.int/company-commitments.aspx?id=48"">100% renewable energy</A> in datacenters… [and] maintain <mark>carbon</mark> neutrality of purchased electricity for U.S. corporate facilities achieved in 2014 through renewable energy purchases and onsite generation and procurement.” In 2014, Apple hired Lisa Jackson, a former administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as its vice president of environmental, policy, and social initiatives, reporting directly to CEO Tim Cook. Along with Jacky Haynes, Apple’s senior director of social and environmental responsibility who specializes in supplier responsibility, Jackson has brokered a relationship with the Beijing-based <A href=""http://doteco.org/partners/institute-of-public-environmental-affairs/"">Institute of Public &amp; Environmental Affairs</A> to train Apple facilities workers as part of Apple’s new Environmental, Health, and Safety Academy and to proactively publish emissions data of Apple’s supplier facilities in China. By committing to voluntary <mark>climate</mark> action, Apple and other corporations signal to consumers that they are socially responsible companies, not only to preempt public scrutiny but to gain an advantage in the “<A href=""https://www.brookings.edu/research/books/2005/marketforvirtue"">market for virtues</A>.”</P><P>Apple and <mark>Microsoft Corp.</mark> are the only two private sector entities that earned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s <A href=""http://www3.epa.gov/greenpower/awards/winners.htm"">Green Power Partner of the Year</A> award in 2015, which recognizes leadership in green power use and overall strategy and impact on the green power market. </P><P>Other IT companies, such as <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>action.unfccc.int/company/autodesk"">Autodesk</A>, <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>action.unfccc.int/company/bt-group"">BT</A>, <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>action.unfccc.int/company/infosys-limited"">Infosys</A>, <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>action.unfccc.int/company/salesforce-com"">Salesforce</A> and <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>action.unfccc.int/company/sap-se"">SAP</A> have recently joined forces with Aviva, IKEA, Starbucks, Walmart, Marks and Spencer, Johnson &amp; Johnson, among others, as part of <A href=""http://there100.org/companies"">RE100</A>, a collaborative initiative of businesses, to set long-term target on powering their operations entirely with renewable energy. </P><H2>Living up to promises</H2></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

                                </SPAN></P><P>“The simple answer is there’s no saving the world without business, but business can’t do it on its own,” says Nigel Topping, CEO of <A href=""https://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org"">We Mean Business</A>. “The reason we need these kinds of coalitions is so that both business leaders and political leaders hear loud and clear that actually the majority of businesses understand that we’ve got to change, and actually are on board and already in motion.”</P><P>We Mean Business is a global coalition of many of the same NGOs that initiated We Are Still In — CDP (formerly the <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project), The B Team, The <mark>Climate</mark> Group, and others — and the two initiatives are closely connected. We Mean Business’s role is to provide a framework for corporate commitments on <mark>climate change</mark> and a platform from which to make those commitments public.</P><H3>Science-based Targets</H3><P>One such commitment is to adopt science-based greenhouse gas emissions targets. This is where <A href=""http://sciencebasedtargets.org"">Science Based Targets</A> comes in. This global collaboration among CDP, World Resources Institute, the World Wide Fund and the United Nations Global Compact encourages and helps corporations to align their <mark>climate change</mark> policies with scientific evidence.</P><P>“What we could observe is a majority of companies were setting targets, but at least from a CDP perspective, we had many challenges to understand what targets were best,” says Pedro Faria, technical director of CDP and member of the Science Based Targets steering committee. “Talking with companies and other NGOs, we realized there was no method, so companies were setting targets based on what was feasible and not what was needed.”</P><P>“It has been extremely important to just make people aware of this concept: Set your ambition according to what the best available science tells you.”</P><P>Science Based Targets helps companies determine what actions they need to take to contribute meaningfully to the global target of remaining below 2°C (3.6°F) warming, a level above which experts say irreversible changes become locked in. These actions will vary across industries, so targets must be tailored to individual companies while still meeting global needs. Nearly 300 companies have signed on from every continent except Antarctica.</P><P>“It has been extremely important to just make people aware of this concept: Set your ambition according to what the best available science tells you,” Faria says. “Our mission is to make science-based targets a new norm.” Sixty-two companies have now set approved science-based targets for emissions reductions. For example, Coca-Cola HBC — a leading bottler of The Coca-Cola Company — has committed to a science-based target of reducing its emissions by 50 percent per liter of drink by 2020.</P><H3>Energy For Renewables</H3><P>Another corporate commitment We Mean Business advocates is the goal of 100 percent renewable power. More than 100 companies, including Ikea, Walmart, Nestle and Unilever have committed to this, but in a complex energy market like that in the U.S., buying this much renewable energy isn’t always easy. So in May 2016, Business for Social Responsibility, the Rocky Mountain Institute, the World Resources Institute and World Wildlife Fund started the <A href=""http://rebuyers.org"">Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance</A>, or REBA, which helps steer corporations through the energy market maze. The end goal is facilitating the deployment of 60 gigawatts of new renewable energy in the U.S. corporate sector by 2025.</P><P>The alliance first made its mark with the World Wildlife Fund and World Resources Institute’s <A href=""http://buyersprinciples.org"">Corporate Renewable Energy Buyers’ Principles</A>, a set of six criteria developed in partnership with a group of large energy buyers to assist utilities in helping companies who want to buy renewable energy.</P><P>Microsoft has stated that it is committed to working with the network and new partners to bring more renewable energy onto the grid.</P><P>But more was needed, says Lily Donge, a principal at the Rocky Mountain Institute. “We realized that the buyers need a trusted space to learn about renewable energy and also find ways to interact with each other and the service providers on the sale side in a more transparent and seamless fashion.” Thus was born the <A href=""http://businessrenewables.org/"">Business Renewables Center</A>, which Donge heads. The center convenes, educates and assists corporations around purchasing off-site, large-scale wind and solar energy. It also hopes to facilitate collective buying, although that aspect is still in development. Donge envisages a scenario in which a city — for example, Seattle — its universities, its utilities and a locally based company such as Microsoft might come together to pool their renewable energy buying power. As one of the first to join the REBA network, Microsoft has stated that it is committed to working with the network and new partners to bring more renewable energy onto the grid. It is just one of the 60 percent of Fortune 100 companies that have now set emissions reductions targets or committed to clean energy.</P><H3>Turning Words Into Action</H3><P>If We Are Still In is the sentiment, We Mean Business is the statement of intent, and initiatives such as Science Based Targets and the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance are the enablers of action, then America’s Pledge will be the scorekeeper.</P><P>Launched on July 12, <A href=""https://www.americaspledgeon<mark>climate</mark>.com"">America’s Pledge</A> will compile and quantify the steps taken by businesses, cities, states and others to address <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Looking across these initiatives, it’s clear which industries are leading the pack. “If you’re one of the IT majors and you haven’t committed to 100 percent renewable electricity, you’re a laggard, you’re a dinosaur, and you really start to stand out,” Topping says. But other industries face more existential challenges around <mark>climate change</mark> action, particularly in the fossil fuel space.</P><P>“While many of the oil majors are publicly supportive of <mark>climate</mark> action and the Paris agreement, some of them are still proposing future energy and emissions scenarios in which there are very high levels of <A href=""https://ensia.com/features/sequestration/""><mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage</A> deployment — levels way higher than the current level of investment suggests is plausible,” Topping says.</P><P>“There’s no sector where there’s a sectoral <mark>climate</mark> denial or sectoral resistance to Paris.”</P><P>But even those industries are publicly engaged. The <A href=""https://www.clcouncil.org""><mark>Climate</mark> Leadership Council</A>, which launched June 20, features big oil companies BP, ExxonMobil, Shell and Total among its founding corporate members.</P><P>“There’s no sector where there’s a sectoral <mark>climate</mark> denial or sectoral resistance to Paris,” Topping says. “It’s just a question of what is the economic pathway of survival.”</P><P>WWF’s senior vice president of <mark>Climate Change</mark> and Energy Lou Leonard says the challenge ahead for all these initiatives and collaborations is to continue to demonstrate the credibility of the voice of these sub-national actors to the rest of the world, particularly in the lead-up to 2020 when all countries are supposed to return to the table with even more stringent targets than were committed to in 2016, in accordance with the Paris agreement.</P><P>“There’s going to have to be a continual injection of confidence and support from non-state actors and sub-nationals in the U.S. if you want those countries to keep [working toward goals],” he says. “This is where the future is, this is where we are going, and we want the rest of the world to know it.” </P><P><EM>This article was reprinted with permission from <A href=""https://ensia.com/"">Ensia</A>.</EM></P></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

In 2010, the <A href=""http://www.cbd.int/<mark>climate</mark>/geoengineering/"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">UN Convention on Biological Diversity declared a moratorium</A> on experiments in the sea and space, <A href=""http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19660-what-the-un-ban-on-geoengineering-really-means.html"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">except for small-scale scientific studies</A>.</P><P>Concern is now growing that the small but influential group of scientists, and their backers, may have a disproportionate effect on major decisions about geoengineering research and policy.</P><P>&quot;We will need to protect ourselves from vested interests [and] be sure that choices are not influenced by parties who might make significant amounts of money through a choice to modify <mark>climate</mark>, especially using proprietary intellectual property,&quot; said Jane Long, director at large for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the US, in a paper delivered to a recent geoengineering conference on ethics.</P><P>&quot;The stakes are very high and scientists are not the best people to deal with the social, ethical or political issues that geoengineering raises,&quot; said Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace. &quot;The idea that a self-selected group should have so much influence is bizarre.&quot;</P><P>Pressure to find a quick technological fix to <mark>climate change</mark> is growing as politicians fail to reach an agreement to significantly reduce emissions. In 2009-2010, the <A href=""http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-903"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">US government received requests for over $2bn</A>(£1.2bn) of grants for geoengineering research, but spent around $100m.</P><P>As well as Gates, other wealthy individuals including Sir <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Branson"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Richard Branson</A>, tar sands magnate <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._Murray_Edwards"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Murray Edwards</A> and the co-founder of Skype, Niklas Zennström, have funded a series of official reports into future use of the technology. Branson, who has frequently called for geoengineering to combat <mark>climate change</mark>, helped fund the Royal Society's inquiry into solar radiation management last year through his <A href=""http://www.<mark>carbon</mark>warroom.com/"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline""><mark>Carbon</mark> War Room</A> charity. It is not known how much he contributed.</P><P>Professors <A href=""http://people.ucalgary.ca/~keith/"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">David Keith</A>, of Harvard University, and <A href=""http://dge.stanford.edu/labs/caldeiralab/Caldeira%20downloads/cv_caldeira.pdf"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Ken Caldeira</A> of Stanford, [see footnote] are the world's two leading advocates of major research into geoengineering the upper atmosphere to provide earth with a reflective shield. They have so far received over $4.6m from Gates to run the <A href=""http://keith.seas.harvard.edu/FICER.html"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Fund for Innovative <mark>Climate</mark> and Energy Research</A> (Ficer). Nearly half Ficer's money, which comes directly from Gates's personal funds, has so far been used for their own research, but the rest is disbursed by them to fund the work of other advocates of large-scale interventions.</P><P>According to statements of financial interests, Keith receives an undisclosed sum from Bill Gates each year, and is the president and majority owner of the geoengineering company <A href=""http://www.<mark>carbon</mark>engineering.com/"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline""><mark>Carbon</mark> Engineering</A>, in which both Gates and Edwards have major stakes – believed to be together worth over $10m.</P><P>Another Edwards company, Canadian Natural Resources, has plans to spend $25bn to turn the bitumen-bearing sand found in northern Alberta into barrels of crude oil. Caldeira says he receives $375,000 a year from Gates, holds a <mark>carbon</mark> capture patent and works for <A href=""http://intellectualventureslab.com/?page_id=258"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Intellectual Ventures</A>, a private geoegineering research company part-owned by Gates and run by Nathan Myhrvold, former head of technology at Microsoft.</P><P>According to the latest Ficer accounts, the two scientists have so far given $300,000 of Gates money to part-fund three prominent reviews and assessments of geoengineering – the <A href=""http://www.srmgi.org/"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">UK Royal Society report on Solar Radiation Management</A>, <A href=""http://www.bipartisanpolicy.org/projects/task-force-geoengineering/about"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">the US Taskforce on Geoengineering</A> and a 2009 <A href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5140"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">report by Novin</A> a science thinktank based in Santa Barbara, California. Keith and Caldeira either sat on the panels that produced the reports or contributed evidence. All three reports strongly recommended more research into solar radiation management.</P><P>The fund also gave $600,000 to Phil Rasch, chief <mark>climate</mark> scientist for the <A href=""http://www.pnl.gov/"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Pacific Northwest national laboratory</A>, one of 10 research institutions funded by the US energy department.</P><P>Rasch gave evidence at the first Royal Society <A href=""http://royalsociety.org/uploadedFiles/Royal_Society_Content/policy/publications/2009/8693.pdf"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">report on geoengineering 2009</A> and was a panel member on the 2011 report. He has testified to the US Congress about the need for government funding of large-scale geoengineering. In addition, Caldeira and Keith gave a further $240,000 to geoengineering advocates to travel and attend workshops and meetings and $100,000 to Jay Apt, a prominent advocate of geoengineering as a last resort, and professor of engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. Apt worked with Keith and <A href=""http://aurora.aero/"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Aurora Flight Sciences</A>, a US company that develops drone aircraft technology for the US military, to <A href=""http://people.ucalgary.ca/~keith/Misc/AuroraGeoReport.pdf"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">study the costs of sending 1m tonnes of sulphate particles</A> into the upper atmosphere a year.</P><P>Analysis of the eight major national and international inquiries into geoengineering over the past three years shows that Keith and Caldeira, Rasch and <A href=""http://www.epp.cmu.edu/people/bios/morgan.html"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Prof Granger Morgan</A> the head of department of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University where Keith works, have sat on seven panels, including one set up by the UN. Three other strong advocates of solar radiation geoengineering, including Rasch, have sat on national inquiries part-funded by Ficer.</P><P>&quot;There are clear conflicts of interest between many of the people involved in the debate,&quot; said Diana Bronson, a researcher with Montreal-based geoengineering watchdog ETC.</P><P>&quot;What is really worrying is that the same small group working on high-risk technologies that will geoengineer the planet is also trying to engineer the discussion around international rules and regulations. We cannot put the fox in charge of the chicken coop.&quot;</P><P>&quot;The eco-clique are lobbying for a huge injection of public funds into geoengineering research. They dominate virtually every inquiry into geoengineering. They are present in almost all of the expert deliberations. They have been the leading advisers to parliamentary and congressional inquiries and their views will, in all likelihood, dominate the deliberations of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC) as it grapples for the first time with the scientific and ethical tangle that is <mark>climate</mark> engineering,&quot; said Clive Hamilton, professor of Public Ethics at the Australian National University, in a Guardian blog.</P><P>The scientists involved reject this notion. &quot;Even the perception that [a small group of people has] illegitimate influence [is] very unhealthy for a technology which has extreme power over the world. The concerns that a small group [is] dominating the debate are legitimate, but things are not as they were,&quot; said Keith. &quot;It's changing as countries like India and China become involved. The era when my voice or that of a few was dominant is over. We need a very broad debate.&quot;</P><P>&quot;Every scientist has some conflict of interest, because we would all like to see more resources going to study things that we find interesting,&quot; said Caldeira. &quot;Do I have too much influence? I feel like I have too little. I have been calling for making <mark>CO2</mark> emissions illegal for many years, but no one is listening to me. People who disagree with me might feel I have too much influence. The best way to reduce my influence is to have more public research funds available, so that our funds are in the noise. If the federal government played the role it should in this area, there would be no need for money from Gates.</P><P>&quot;Regarding my own patents, I have repeatedly stated that if any patent that I am on is ever used for the purposes of altering <mark>climate</mark>, then any proceeds that accrue to me for this use will be donated to nonprofit NGOs and charities. I have no expectation or interest in developing a personal revenue stream based upon the use of these patents for <mark>climate</mark> modification.&quot;.</P><P>Rasch added: &quot;I don't feel there is any conflict of interest. I don't lobby, work with patents or intellectual property, do classified research or work with for-profit companies. The research I do on geoengineering involves computer simulations and thinking about possible consequences. The Ficer foundation that has funded my research tries to be transparent in their activities, as do I.&quot;</P><P><SPAN class=""bullet"">•</SPAN> This article was amended on 8 February 2012.

Carter and Lynn Loo, director of the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment — took part in and led discussions on major global issues at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum that concluded Friday, Jan. 20, in Davos, Switzerland.</P><P>The delegation, led by Princeton University President Christopher L. Eisgruber, also included engineering faculty member Denise Mauzerall, who is jointly appointed in <A href=""http://www.princeton.edu/cee/"" target=""_blank"">civil and environmental engineering</A> and the <A href=""http://wws.princeton.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs</A>.</P><P>Each year, the meeting brings together leaders, scholars and practitioners from the public and private sectors to seek solutions to a broad range of world problems. Topics the Princeton faculty addressed included <mark>climate change</mark>, income inequality and public health, strengthening democracy, and technological <mark>innovation</mark>. Eisgruber participated in meetings of university leaders from around the world and hosted a &quot;Princeton in Davos&quot; reception for alumni, faculty, media and other conference attendees.</P><P>&quot;Princeton has important contributions to make to discussions aimed at solving global challenges, such as the ones that took place in Davos,&quot; Eisgruber said. &quot;The eight Princeton faculty members who participated in the annual meeting have made pathbreaking contributions to a variety of fields, and they exemplify the University’s commitment to teaching and research that make a positive difference in the world.&quot;</P><P>In an interview with the news agency Reuters, Carter spoke about <mark>innovation</mark> as a driver of economic opportunity. &quot;All of the things that make our lives easier, all the discoveries in health, all the discoveries in sustain able energy, the discoveries in information technology, cell phones – everything you can think of that involves technology and has made our lives better – started in a laboratory somewhere or in a computer simulation somewhere, long ago. At least two decades ago, on average, before it gets to market,&quot; Carter said. &quot;So it's so important to be able to find those discoveries that will lead to the next great industry that will then provide many, many jobs.&quot;</P><P>On Thursday afternoon, Eisgruber introduced the University’s interdisciplinary &quot;IdeasLab&quot; panel discussion, &quot;Responding to <mark>Climate Change</mark>,&quot; which featured four University faculty members leading discussions about adapting to and mitigating <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Taking part were Carter; Mauzerall; Guy Nordenson, professor of <A href=""http://soa.princeton.edu/"" target=""_blank"">architecture</A>; and Michael Oppenheimer, the Albert G. Milbank Professor of <A href=""https://www.princeton.edu/geosciences/"" target=""_blank"">Geosciences</A> and International Affairs and the <A href=""http://environment.princeton.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Princeton Environmental Institute</A>.</P><P>Eisgruber also moderated an informal panel discussion hosted by Princeton University and Microsoft, &quot;Income Inequality and Opportunities to Improve the Human Condition,&quot; which featured Bill Gates, founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and <mark>Microsoft Corp.</mark>; Angus Deaton, the 2015 Nobel laureate in <A href=""http://economics.princeton.edu/"" target=""_blank"">economics</A> and the Dwight D. Eisenhower Professor of International Affairs, Emeritus; Hon. Navdeep Bains, minister of <mark>innovation</mark>, science and economic development in Canada; and Carter.</P><P>&quot;Technology has amazing power to make differences in people's lives,&quot; Carter said in an interview following the panel. &quot;It is the case too that people can look at technology and be fearful of it. We all know that sometimes technologies end up displacing jobs because of automation. The fact is that what technology ultimately should be able to do is to free up people to be creative. One thing that people have over machines, every kind of machine, including computers, is the ability to be creative in a way that is uniquely human.&quot;</P><P><A href=""http://acee.princeton.edu"" target=""_blank"">Andlinger Center</A> Director Loo, who also is a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader, participated in a dinner discussion, &quot;Beyond the Possible,&quot; with scientists, technologists and artists on turning science fiction into fact.</P><P>Loo also participated in a &quot;<A href=""https://www.facebook.com/Tradeshift/videos/1347739741934550/"" target=""_blank"">Breakfast Influencer Panel</A>&quot; on energy technology and women in technology, sponsored by the web-based marketplace Tradeshift. Loo said work at the Andlinger Center ranges from fundamental investigation into materials with potential use in energy technology to start-up companies taking research into the market. &quot;Fundamental science develops into <mark>innovation</mark>s, which then can be pushed out,&quot; she said.</P><P>Princeton delegates were interviewed by many of the journalists covering Davos. Deaton was queried on a range of topics, including economic inequality, globalization and the new political landscape. Oppenheimer participated in a CNBC panel discussion on the future of <mark>sustainable</mark> energy. <A href=""https://www.princeton.edu/politics/"" target=""_blank"">Politics</A> professor Jan-Werner Müller spoke with several outlets, including Reuters, which also <A href=""https://www.facebook.com/ReutersMoney/videos/867659946669974/"" target=""_blank"">interviewed Carter live on Facebook</A>. Carter also contributed <A href=""https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/smashing-the-glass-ceiling-6-davos-leaders-explain-how-they-did-it"" target=""_blank"">a post to the Forum’s blog</A> on how women can shatter the &quot;glass ceiling&quot; in their careers.</P><P>&quot;My words of advice are these,&quot; Carter wrote. &quot;Find work that gives your life meaning and don’t let anyone dissuade you from pursuing it. Constructive action is the best answer to prejudice. Your hard and excellent work will speak for itself.&quot;</P><P>Eisgruber's interviews included <A href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/princeton-president-i-hope-congress-doesnt-tax-our-endowment-195559332.html"" target=""_blank"">one with Yahoo! Finance</A> in which he was asked for the state of Princeton today. &quot;The University is very strong,&quot; Eisgruber replied. &quot;We have the most socio-economically diverse class the University has ever admitted, and that's something we think is very important to our future and to the country's future.&quot;</P><P>He also talked about the importance of endowments to enable colleges and universities to achieve their teaching and research missions.</P><P>&quot;From our standpoint, we feel the most important thing is to be explaining what these endowments do for colleges and universities. At Princeton, they're supporting our financial aid program. It's more affordable to be a Princeton student today than when I was a student there,&quot; said Eisgruber, a graduate of the Class of 1983. &quot;It's more affordable for most students to go to a place like Princeton University than it is to go to their local state university because that endowment is paying for half of what the college or university does.&quot;</P><P>As part of the official World Economic Forum program, Duncan Haldane, the 2016 Nobel laureate in physics and the Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics, discussed his journey of scientific discovery and joined other science laureates at a panel on &quot;Improving the State of the World.&quot; Deaton participated in a similar event featuring economics laureates, and also shared his expertise in sessions on combating inequality and raising life expectancy and expectations.</P><P>Müller gave presentations on &quot;Pundits, Professors and Predictions,&quot; &quot;Strengthening Democracy&quot; and &quot;The Post-EU Era.&quot;</P><P><A href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbHTNtpVO5Y&amp;t=26s"" target=""_blank"">Oppenheimer</A>, <A href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XD0_RyvDPM"" target=""_blank"">Nordenson</A>, <A href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-MiN_0kYhM"" target=""_blank"">Mauzerall</A> and <A href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEG7iSxhf8g"" target=""_blank"">Carter</A> also gave solo presentations on the topics they presented in the &quot;IdeasLab&quot; panel.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE><SECTION id=""associated-faculty"" class=""related-faculty""><DIV class=""faculty-content rename-class-three""><H2>Related People</H2></DIV></SECTION></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Here's what business leaders must do next, according to <STRONG>Michael Toffel</STRONG> and <STRONG>Auden Schendler</STRONG>.</STRONG><DIV class=""shim20""> </DIV><DIV class=""hr""> </DIV><STRONG><DIV class="" authors"">by Michael Toffel &amp; Auden Schendler</DIV></STRONG><DIV class=""article-content""><DIV class=""ExternalClass6E11001032A4437C82D1C75E098A2557""><P>Green initiatives are ubiquitous these days, implemented with zeal at companies like Dupont, IBM, Walmart, and Walt Disney. The programs being rolled out—lighting retrofits, zero-waste factories, and carpool incentives—save money and provide a green glow. Most large companies are working to reduce energy use and waste, and many have integrated sustainability into strategic planning. What's not to like?</P><P>Well, for starters, these actions don't meaningfully address the primary barrier to sustainability, <mark>climate change</mark>. According to the International Energy Agency, without action, global temperatures will likely increase 6 degrees C by 2100, &quot;which would have devastating consequences for the planet.&quot; This means more super droughts, floods, storms, fires, crop failures, sea-level rise, and other major disruptions. &quot;Sustainability&quot; simply isn't possible in the face of such a problem, as Superstorm Sandy demonstrated.</P><P>So despite perceptions that &quot;<mark>sustainable</mark> business&quot; is up and running, the environment reminds us we're failing to deal with the problem at anywhere near sufficient scale. Because <mark>climate change</mark> requires a systemic solution, which only governments can provide, firms serious about addressing it have a critical role well beyond greening their own operations. They must spur government action. But few are.</P><P>&quot;Green business&quot; as currently practiced focuses on limited operational efficiencies—cutting <mark>carbon</mark> footprint and waste reduction—and declares victory. But these measures fail to even dent the <mark>climate</mark> problem. And the proof is easy: Greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. Last month, we hit 400 parts per million atmospheric <mark>CO2</mark> for the first time in 3 million years. Worse, though, such small-ball initiatives are a distraction: We fiddle around the edges thinking we're making a real difference (and getting accolades), while the planet inexorably warms.</P><P>The reality is that even if one company eliminates its <mark>carbon</mark> footprint entirely—as Microsoft admirably pledged to do—global warming roars on. That's because the problem is too vast for any single business: Solving <mark>climate change</mark> means we must switch to mostly <mark>carbon</mark>-free energy sources by 2050 or find a way to affordably capture <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions, both monumental tasks.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>“Green business as currently practiced focuses on limited operational efficiencies”</BLOCKQUOTE><P>Even several very large companies cannot, on their own, get us there. In fact, historically, no big environmental problem, from air and water <mark>pollution</mark> to acid rain or ozone depletion, has ever been solved by businesses volunteering to do the right thing. We ought not presume that voluntary measures will solve this one.</P><P>But nobody seems to have noticed. Most green scorecards, corporate strategies, media, and shareholder analyses of businesses focus almost entirely on operational greening activities and policies, but not on whether companies can continue on their current course in a <mark>climate</mark>-changed world. In other words, such analyses don't actually measure sustainability.</P><P>So what does a meaningful corporate sustainability program look like in the era of <mark>climate change</mark>?</P><P>First, corporate leaders need to directly <STRONG>lobby state and national politicians</STRONG> to introduce sweeping, aggressive bipartisan <mark>climate</mark> legislation such as a <mark>carbon</mark> fee-and-dividend program. Strong policy in G8 nations is all the more important because it removes excuses for inaction by China, India, and other countries with rapidly growing <mark>carbon</mark> footprints.</P><P>Second, CEOs should <STRONG>insist that trade groups prioritize <mark>climate policy</mark> activism</STRONG> and withdraw from associations that refuse to do so, like when Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, Apple, and Nike left the US Chamber of Commerce over its opposition to regulating greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P>Third, businesses should <STRONG>market their <mark>climate</mark> activism</STRONG> so that customers and suppliers appreciate their leadership, understand what matters, and follow suit. Such marketing is also education on one of the key issues of our time.</P><P>Fourth, companies should <STRONG>partner with effective non-governmental organizations</STRONG> such as the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies, the Natural Resources Defense Council, 350.org, Protect Our Winters, and Citizen's <mark>Climate</mark> Lobby to support their work, become educated on <mark>climate</mark> science and policy solutions, and understand effective lobbying.</P><P>Fifth, managers should <STRONG>demand that suppliers assess their <mark>climate</mark> impact and set public targets</STRONG> to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But companies that are multiplying their influence in supply chains, like Dell and Walmart, must not miss the larger and more important opportunity to change the rules of the game through activism.</P><P>Even in the United States, a <mark>climate</mark> laggard, some companies are already responding to <mark>climate change</mark> in the appropriate way.</P><P>Nike, for example, moved beyond operational greening by helping to create BICEP (Business for Innovative <mark>Climate</mark> and Energy Policy), which brings its members to Washington, D.C., to lobby for aggressive energy and <mark>climate</mark> legislation.</P><P>Starbucks has also taken out full-page ads in major newspapers to raise public awareness about the importance of <mark>climate</mark> action and has lobbied the US Congress and the Obama administration to explain the threat <mark>climate</mark> poses to coffee.</P><P>These companies are the exception. Unfortunately, even businesses that are sustainability leaders—like clothing manufacturer Patagonia, a business we admire—don't recognize the primacy of <mark>climate change</mark>. Instead, it includes <mark>climate</mark> in a basket of equally weighted issues, like protecting oceans, forests, or fisheries. But that's misguided: <mark>Climate</mark> vastly trumps (and often includes) those other environmental concerns.</P><P>Businesses that claim to be green but aren't loudly making their voices heard on the need for government action on <mark>climate change</mark> are missing the point. They are not just dodging the key challenge of sustainability; they are distracting us from what really matters.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""authorinfo""><H3 class=""mu-uc"">About the Author</H3><DIV class=""nu""><DIV data-wcm-edit-url=""/Lists/Authors/EditForm.aspx?ID=5668""><P><EM><STRONG>Michael Toffel</STRONG> is an associate professor at Harvard Business School, where he specializes in business and environment issues. <STRONG>Auden Schendler</STRONG> is vice president of sustainability at Aspen Skiing Company, author of </EM>Getting Green Done<EM>, and a board member of Protect Our Winters.</EM></P><P><STRONG>This article was first published on <A href=""http://grist.org/"">Grist.org</A> under the title <A href=""http://grist.org/<mark>climate</mark>-energy/corporate-sustainability-is-not-<mark>sustainable</mark>/"">Corporate Sustainability is Not <mark>Sustainable</mark></A>.</STRONG></P></DIV><DIV data-wcm-edit-url=""/Lists/Authors/EditForm.aspx?ID=5669""><P><EM><STRONG>Michael Toffel</STRONG> is an associate professor at Harvard Business School, where he specializes in business and environment issues. <STRONG>Auden Schendler</STRONG> is vice president of sustainability at Aspen Skiing Company, author of </EM>Getting Green Done<EM>, and a board member of Protect Our Winters.</EM></P><P><STRONG>This article was first published on <A href=""http://grist.org/"">Grist.org</A> under the title <A href=""http://grist.org/<mark>climate</mark>-energy/corporate-sustainability-is-not-<mark>sustainable</mark>/"">Corporate Sustainability is Not <mark>Sustainable</mark></A>.</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""comments""><UL class=""unstyled""><LI>Tim Gieseke</LI><LI class=""ash"">President, Ag Resource Strategies,LLC</LI></UL></DIV><mark>Climate change</mark> or atmospheric composition are key components of the ecology and economy.

Because, the amount of man made C02 is dwarfed by the naturally occuring C02.  Example:  C02 released during one volcano is estimated to have entirely wiped out the last 10 and next 10 years of efforts to reduce C02.  Another clue--C02 levels and <mark>climate change</mark> are NOT exclusively linked. They are related along with many other factors.  Why is this important?  A great many other factors have caused global temperatures to rise and fall dramatically BEFORE man made C02 came on the scene. 
  however, there is lots of money to be made from this scare.  Those who are, rely on those without knoweledge to stay that way.  I'm a man of faith but also recognize data and global warming IS slowly happening.  However, don't buy into the myth that reducing man made C02 will have any real impact.<LI>Christy</LI><LI class=""ash"">Marketing</LI></DIV>The actions proposed in the article are a wonderful road map to follow if everyone in your organization is on board. However, historically, even governments have struggled to make environmentally related commitments based on the economic impacts of adhering to stringent regulation. The Kyoto Protocol is a good example. For some businesses (not all), it is NOT in the best interest for the company's survival to publicly sit on the side of the fence for <mark>climate change</mark>. Especially when such positioning is so polarizing and may conflict with the interests and beliefs of vital stakeholders. <mark>Climate change</mark> is a touchy subject. There is still much debate over whether humans, are impacting it. No individual or company wants to go down in history as the fool that fought for a cause that turned out to be a farce. This statement may upset <mark>climate change</mark> advocates, but it is a reality in business decisions. No business wants to ignore the issue
  either, so many choose the safe middle ground. Brand and image are everything.<LI>Narayan</LI><LI class=""ash"">Vice President, Wipro</LI></DIV>While the five point action agenda suggested in the article is nice, it still will amount to only a 'dent' against <mark>climate change</mark>. <mark>Climate</mark> science shows that even if all our GHG emissions drop to zero today, the greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere will stay for more than a 100 years. Given the inherently complex inter-linkages between energy, GHG emissions, water, waste, biodiversity,public health and food - to name just a few - 'within the boundary' corporate sustainability programs really mean very little. It is best if the business world woke up to this fact. The statement 'we are becoming more <mark>sustainable</mark>' needs to be replaced by 'we are becoming less un<mark>sustainable</mark>'. The two are clearly not the same and organizations need to articulate this without any ambiguity to themselves as well as to their public stakeholders.<LI>Mike Toffel</LI><LI class=""ash"">Associate Professor, Harvard Business School</LI></DIV>For those looking for thoughtful and accessible insights regarding the science of <mark>climate change</mark>, I recommend two excellent websites - Real <mark>Climate</mark> and <mark>Climate</mark> Progress (links below).

He was 52, two years younger than Barack Obama is now; he hadn’t worked outside the government in decades; and even if he managed to cope personally with a historically bitter disappointment that might have broken many people, he would still face the task of deciding how to spend the upcoming years.</P><P>Some of the answers he found are known to everyone. He connected himself with the leading tech firms of the era, Google and Apple. In 2005 he and a partner launched Current TV, which in 2013 was sold to Al Jazeera for several hundred million dollars. Throughout his political life he was poor compared with many senators; now by any standard he is rich. According to his financial-disclosure forms, Gore was worth between $1 million and $2 million when he ran for president. Gore declined to discuss his personal finances with me, but published estimates of his net worth are in the hundreds of millions. He was the most prominent U.S. politician to issue an early warning against the impending invasion of Iraq, which he did in a speech in California in September 2002. His first book about <mark>climate change</mark>, <I>An Inconvenient Truth</I>, was a No. 1 international best seller. The movie version won two Oscars, the audiobook won a Grammy, and for his <mark>climate</mark> work Gore was a co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-2""><P>Gore is still involved on most of these fronts. He has become a partner in the Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins and is a member of the Apple board. He founded and chairs an advocacy group called the <mark>Climate</mark> Reality Project, travels constantly for speeches, and has published several books since <I>An Inconvenient Truth</I>, including another No. 1 best seller, <I>The Assault on Reason</I>. I asked him how he divided his time among the projects. “Probably a little more than half on <mark>Climate</mark> Reality,” and then half on some other commitments. “And then probably another half on Generation.”</P><P>The object of this final “half” is Generation Investment Management, a company that is rarely mentioned in press coverage of Gore but that he says is as ambitious as his other efforts.</P><P>The most sweeping way to describe this undertaking is as a demonstration of a new version of capitalism, one that will shift the incentives of financial and business operations to reduce the environmental, social, political, and long-term economic damage being caused by un<mark>sustainable</mark> commercial excesses. What this means in practical terms is that Gore and his Generation colleagues have done the theoretically impossible: Over the past decade, they have made more money, in the Darwinian competition of international finance, by applying an environmentally conscious model of “<mark>sustainable</mark>” investing than have most fund managers who were guided by a straight-ahead pursuit of profit at any environmental or social price.</P><ASIDE class=""pullquote instapaper_ignore"">A growing number of economists warn that ever shorter time horizons are destroying businesses and entire economies.</ASIDE><P>Their demonstration has its obvious limits: It’s based on the track record of one firm, which through one decade-long period has managed assets that are merely boutique-scale in the industry’s terms. Generation now invests a total of about $12 billion for its clients, which are mainly pension funds and other institutional investors, half U.S.-based and half overseas. For comparison, total assets under management by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset-management firm, are about $5 trillion, or 400 times as much. But for investment strategies, the past decade has been a revealing one, with its bubbles, historic crashes, and dramatic shifts in economic circumstances in China, Europe, and every other part of the globe.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-3""><P>During that tumultuous time, from the summer of 2005 through this past June, the MSCI World Index, a widely accepted measure of global stock-market performance, showed an overall average growth rate of 7 percent a year. According to Mercer, a prominent London-based analytical firm, the average <I>pre-fee</I> return for the global-equity managers it surveys was 7.7 percent. This meant that after fees, which average about 70 “basis points” (or seven-tenths of 1 percent), the returns an average professional money manager could produce barely kept up with plain old low-cost, passive index funds. Individual investors have heard this message (“You can’t beat the market, so why try?”) for years, from index-investing firms like Vanguard. The Mercer analysis says that it applies even to the big-endowment pros.</P><P>But through that same period, according to Mercer, the average return for Generation’s global-equity fund, in which nearly all its assets are invested, was 12.1 percent a year, or more than 500 basis points above the MSCI index’s growth rate. Of the more than 200 global-equity managers in the survey, Generation’s 10-year average ranked as No. 2. In addition to being nearly the highest-returning fund, Generation’s global-equity fund was among the least volatile.</P><P>Gore is obviously delighted to discuss the implications of his firm’s success. “I wanted us to start talking when the five-year returns were in, but cooler heads persuaded me that we should wait until now,” he told me. But he says he is not doing so to attract more business. The minimum investment Generation will accept in its main fund is $3 million, and even then individuals must show they have total assets many times that large to be “qualified investors.” And besides, its most successful fund is now closed to new investment. Instead he and his colleagues are aiming at a small audience within the financial world that steers the flow of capital, and at the political authorities that set the rules for the financial system. “It turns out that in capitalism, the people with the real influence are the ones with capital!,” Gore told me during one of our talks this year. The message he hopes Generation’s record will call attention to is one the world’s investors can’t ignore: They can <I>make more money</I> if they change their practices in a way that will, at the same time, also reduce the environmental and social damage modern capitalism can do.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-4""><P>“We are making the case for long-term greed,” David Blood told me in July. Blood is Generation’s senior partner and on-scene leader at its headquarters in London. The formal name for the concept he and Gore are advancing is <I><mark>sustainable</mark> capitalism</I>, which sounds both more familiar and less hard-edged than what I understand to be the real underlying idea. The idea is that if some tenets of “long term” and “value based” investing are extended to include the environmental and social ramifications of corporate activity, the result can be better financial performance, rather than returns that are “nearly as good” or “worth it when you think of the social benefits.”</P><P>I asked David Rubenstein, the billionaire co-founder and co-CEO of the Carlyle Group, the private-equity firm, what he thought of Generation’s aspirations and its business model. “The general theory in investing is that the highest returns go to those who are unencumbered by sustainability or other environmental and social constraints,” he said. Generation’s “pitch that the conventional wisdom is wrong may be right; their record would be a good barometer.”</P><P>“They are indeed unusual, in applying such a comprehensive sustainability perspective,” Dominic Barton, the global head of McKinsey, said when I asked him about Generation’s approach. “They have created a real demonstration vehicle for the idea that if you are broad-minded and care about externalities, you can actually <I>add</I> shareholder value. Many people have talked about this, but now they have done it.” The economist Laura Tyson, of UC Berkeley, who is part of Generation’s unpaid advisory board, said that Gore and Blood were “genuine pioneers” in showing the practicality of their investment approach. “When they started, very few people believed that a sustainability strategy could offer competitive returns,” she told me. “Their hypothesis has been borne out by their results.”</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-5""><P>No single small company is going to change finance by itself, and Generation’s past results are no guarantee of its future. But previous examples of market success—Peter Lynch of Fidelity in the early mutual-fund days, Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway with his emphasis on the long term, David Swensen of Yale with his returns from unconventional investments, John Bogle of Vanguard with his advocacy of low-cost indexing—have shifted behavior. Generation’s goal is to present an example of a less environmentally and socially destructive path toward high returns.</P></SECTION><FIGURE class=""full-width"" style=""max-width: 960.0px;""><FIGCAPTION class=""caption"">“We are making the case for long-term greed.” Al Gore and David Blood, in Generation’s New York City Office. August 25, 2015. (Christopher Griffith)</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><SECTION id=""article-section-6""><P class=""dropcap"">T<SPAN class=""smallcaps"">he chain of logic</SPAN> behind this argument starts with the assumption that capitalism has shown its superiority to all other systems—as Gore put it to me, “it has proven to unlock a higher fraction of human potential” than any alternative system for making money—and markets are the most efficient way to allocate resources. But markets often overshoot, creating bubbles and busts like the destructive subprime real-estate disaster of the 2000s, and through its history the global capitalist system as a whole has periodically overshot, causing national or worldwide crises. The financial and industrial crises of the late 19th century led to reforms in the United States (and revolution in Russia) but were never fully resolved in Europe. The more profound crisis of the Great Depression led to the modern welfare state.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-7""><P>The capitalist crisis of our times, to follow this logic, shows up in the recurring booms and busts, the widening gaps between rich and poor, and the intensifying pressures on the natural environment. In many countries, including the United States, overall growth has stagnated through the past decade, and the median income has fallen even while total wealth has gone up.</P><P>In one way or another, all of these problems are related to faulty market signals or destructive incentives within today’s capitalism. Since the 2008 financial crisis, a growing number of economists, managers, and financiers have warned that ever shorter time horizons are destroying businesses and entire economies. For instance, this spring Laurence Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, sent a cautionary letter to hundreds of CEOs. As a group, he said, they were too attentive to short-term profitability and stock values, at the cost of the long-term welfare of their firms. “The average <I>Fortune </I>500 CEO has a term of only five years,” Fink told me. “If you’re going to build a new factory in a manufacturing company, the break-even point is probably longer than that. In pharmaceuticals, the payoff time may be more than twice that long. There’s an incentive not to reinvest. You see these behaviors, year after year, and it’s a big problem.” Dominic Barton, of McKinsey, has written or co‑written three influential articles in the <I>Harvard Business Review</I> on the pernicious effects of short-term pressures. According to a 2012 Harvard Business School study, simply issuing quarterly profit guidance, which most Wall Street analysts demand, led managers to overemphasize immediate returns in a way that reduced long-term profitability.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-8""><P>So far these might sound like lessons from one of Warren Buffett’s annual letters to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, or the pre-IPO letter from Google’s founders on why they were determined to resist short-term profitability pressures.</P><P>The <mark>sustainable</mark>-capitalism concept includes a long-term outlook, a search for underlying value, and an attempt to resist distraction by market ephemera. But it adds the idea that the real, dollars-and-cents, balance-sheet value of a company is best assessed by including factors deliberately left out of many business measurements. Among them are a company’s environmental effects, the culture it creates internally, and its impact on the societies in which it operates.</P><P>This contention involves some elements that seem blandly commonsensical, like the importance of matching pay and incentive structures with a company’s long-term interests. But others are anything but conventional. For instance, Warren Buffett considers Coca-Cola a wonderful long-term value proposition, because of its decades-long track record of worldwide success. By Generation’s standards, it is distinctly un<mark>sustainable</mark>, since obesity problems in all of its leading market countries will, in the firm’s view, inevitably do to the soda industry what public-health concerns have done to Big Tobacco.</P><P>Generation’s best-known analysis is its 2013 report asserting that coal and petroleum reserves were “stranded assets” whose theoretical market value would never be realized, because environmental, legal, technological, and market constraints would inevitably prevent much of that <mark>carbon</mark> from being sold and burned. Generation argued that the bankruptcies, write-downs, and market declines that had battered the coal industry in the past decade would soon extend to oil companies. As a prominent Harvard alumnus, Gore has said that the university’s endowment should divest itself of <mark>carbon</mark>-based assets. “But I say that not just because it’s the ‘right’ thing to do but because it is the economically smart thing to do,” Gore told me. “Oil companies have assets on the books worth $21 trillion, but that’s based on the fiction that all that <mark>carbon</mark> is going to be burned.”</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-9""><P>***</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-10""><H3><SPAN class=""smallcaps"">Seeing More of the “Spectrum”</SPAN></H3><P>I’ve observed, interviewed, and slightly known Gore over the decades, and have been on better and worse terms with him over that time (based mainly on what I had most recently written about him). It’s common knowledge that his physical appearance varies. When I saw him this summer, he looked good—sturdy rather than portly, tall and erect, hair now gray rather than jet-black but still present and combed straight back. His speaking mode has also varied by year and by setting: sometimes loose and wisecracking, sometimes ponderous and slow. When I spoke with him through a long afternoon in Nashville this summer, he seemed to have evolved a jokey enjoyment of his own weakness for pedantry.</P><P>For instance: As I first walked into his office, he showed me a big photo of the Earth, like the famous <I>Blue Marble</I> picture from <I>Apollo 17</I> that everyone has seen. This one showed Africa and Europe, rather than the Americas, as in the <I>Apollo</I> shot. “Nice!,” I said, or something similar. He realized he had an opening for a little tutelage, so he explained to me why this photo, far from <I>nice</I>, was something extraordinary.</P><P>It turned out that the familiar <I>Blue Marble</I> picture was not just the best-known “full disk” picture of the Earth. It was, according to Gore, <I>the only one </I>of that exact type ever taken—until, that is, a few days earlier, when a <SPAN class=""smallcaps"">NASA</SPAN> satellite had produced the second-ever photograph, the one Gore was now showing to his underappreciative visitor. Gore had initiated the Deep Space <mark>Climate</mark> Observatory satellite program, known as <SPAN class=""smallcaps"">DSCOVR</SPAN>, when he was vice president; Dick Cheney personally zeroed out its funding as soon as he could, and the program went into hibernation until the Obama administration revived it. After more than 40 years in which one <I>Blue Marble</I> photo of the Earth existed, <SPAN class=""smallcaps"">DSCOVR</SPAN> would start producing photos every day. “I love explaining this!,” Gore said—and obviously he did. But he also seemed to be taking some arm’s-length amusement, in a way I had not seen him do during his competitive political career, at the spectacle of himself giving this little lecture.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-11""><P>He loved the spectrum even more. Halfway through our talk he asked politely, “Has anyone mentioned the metaphor of the spectrum, as a guide to our work?” I said that, as it happened, during my recent visit to the Generation Investment headquarters in London, every single person had mentioned it to me. It was a core part of company culture. And I was actually holding in my hand a chart that explained the concept. And …</P><P>“Oh, that’s great!” he said, and sat looking a little disappointed for a moment. Then he brightened. “But this is important, so I’d just like to explain …”</P><P>So now let me explain! We all know that there’s a spectrum of visible light, from red at one end, with the lowest-frequency waves, to violet at the other, with the highest. Everyone has also heard in science class that visible light is only a small part of the full electromagnetic spectrum. The spectrum extends in a vastly broader range than we can see. Just below red, on the low end, it goes first to infrared and then farther down to microwaves and radio waves. On the high-frequency end, it goes from violet to ultraviolet and then up to X-rays and gamma rays. But until 200 years ago, people had no idea that the nonvisible parts of the spectrum even existed. “We can see less than one-tenth of 1 percent of what’s really there,” Gore said, making sure I got the point. “We were blind and didn’t know what we couldn’t see!”</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-12""><P>The reason everyone at Generation uses this analogy is that it matches their ambition: to improve investment choices by bringing more information into the range of the visible rather than leaving anything out. (The other two words they use all the time are <I>sustainability</I>, which of course is their central precept, and <I>holistic</I>, to describe their inclusive analytical approach. I’ve gone this far in my journalistic career without feeling compelled to use <I>holistic</I>; I deploy it here as part of my reportorial duty.)</P><P>From Generation’s perspective, most of what passes for “financial” analysis—the focus on price-to-earnings ratios, the daily chatter on why the markets moved, the screaming on the cable shows, the speculation about the Federal Reserve—is equivalent to the tiny slice of the entire spectrum human eyes can see. It’s hard to detect the full extent of the spectrum, but Generation believes that attempting to do so can make businesses both more <mark>sustainable</mark> and more profitable.</P><P>When the spectrum model is applied to investing, it means a subtly but significantly different approach from some of the “ethical investing” approaches of the past. For as long as there have been buyers and sellers, borrowers and lenders, people have considered using market power for noneconomic ends, as in boycotts of British tea by the American colonialists in the 18th century and boycotts of the products of American slave labor in the 19th. The current ethical-investment movement dates to the 1960s, when students pressured their universities to rid endowments of holdings in defense contractors or big polluters. The most famous political success of what is called a “negative screen” approach—ruling out certain categories of investment—was the anti-apartheid boycott of South African products and businesses in the 1980s and early 1990s. But all of these methods viewed “ethics” as a minus, the unavoidable cost of doing the right thing. The people at Generation, of course, contend that the “holistic” and “<mark>sustainable</mark>” view is a business plus, in the service of long-term greed.</P><ASIDE class=""pullquote instapaper_ignore"">Generation’s deliberative process for choosing investments differs profoundly from the investment-house norm.</ASIDE><P>They have more evidence to draw on than just their own. The most comprehensive recent research in this field, released last year by economists at Oxford University in collaboration with the investment firm Arabesque, drew on 190 academic studies and news reports about businesses that had and had not applied sustainability policies. The business-world term for these policies is <I>ESG</I>, meaning that in addition to normal profit-and-loss calculations a company factors in the environmental, social, and governance effects of what it does. In spectrum-analogy terms, these are policies that broaden considerations beyond the narrow range of visible light. (A related concept is that of the “triple bottom line,” promoted by the British consultant John Elkington starting in the 1990s. This is the idea that, in addition to the normal financial profit-and-loss bottom line, corporations should also be measured by the bottom line of their environmental and social effects.) The Oxford-Arabesque report found overwhelming evidence that “it is in the best economic interest for corporate managers and investors to incorporate sustainability considerations into decision-making processes.” According to the study, the advantages include more stable (and less volatile) revenues, significantly lower cost of capital, higher profits, and better share-price performance.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-13""><P>In an ongoing series of speeches, the Bank of England’s chief economist, Andrew Haldane, has similarly emphasized that firms and investors that widen their perspective and look beyond this quarter’s or year’s results can earn predictably higher returns than those that don’t. Most people who have taken economics courses would say: That can’t be so! If the returns really were higher, everyone would already be investing this way. Arbitrage would even out the returns. (In economics courses, this is known as the “$20 bill paradox”: An economist sees some money lying on the sidewalk and says, “That can’t be a $20 bill, because if it were, someone would have picked it up.”) But Haldane’s analysis shows a persistent market failure because of habits of mind, compensation structure, and other real-world factors that make investors undervalue long-term returns. Thus there are potential increased rewards for those who can organize themselves to think differently and buck the trend.</P><P>***</P><H3><SPAN class=""smallcaps""><B>When Gore Met Blood </B></SPAN></H3><P>“I won’t be one of those people saying, ‘Oh, it wasn’t about the money,’ ” Gore told me about his early postelection work for an asset-management firm called Metropolitan West, based in Newport Beach, California. “I am telling you straight up, it was <I>about the money</I>. They were very nice people, and they offered me enough money to get my attention.”</P><P>After a year of work, Gore had improved his finances and found the intellectual exercise of asset management—matching insights about opportunities and challenges to bets on particular firms—to be truly interesting. “I decided that I wanted to continue in the business, but I wanted to do it on my own terms,” he told me. By 2003 Gore had made enough money to consider buying an investment company, and looked hard at one in Switzerland called <mark>Sustainable</mark> Asset Management. A friend at Goldman Sachs was advising him in this investment and said: You don’t really want to buy a company. What you want to do is meet David Blood.</P></SECTION><FIGURE class=""full-width"" style=""max-width: 960.0px;""><FIGCAPTION class=""caption"">“Long-term business success requires a holistic view, involving teamwork, integrity, values.” The London office. September 8, 2015. (Christopher Griffith)</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><SECTION id=""article-section-14""><P>Then in his early 40s, Blood had enjoyed a conventionally successful finance career, starting from an unconventional background. He grew up in the prosperous suburbs of Detroit, where his father was an executive with Ford. When he was 11 and headed into sixth grade, his father was reassigned to Brazil, and the whole family moved to São Paulo. Each morning, through the window by his breakfast table, he could look out directly onto a Brazilian slum, or favela. “I could throw a baseball into the house of a boy my age,” he told me when I met him in London. “I wondered how it was that I was here and he was there. That has bothered me all those years since, the disparity in income and wealth. It was a moment that led to the founding of Generation.”</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-15""><P>Blood came back to the United States for high school, was a star football linebacker at Hamilton College, in New York, and planned to become a child psychologist. But he didn’t get into graduate school, and his application for the Peace Corps was turned down. “My father said, ‘You have to get a job,’ and the only offer I got was from a bank.</P><P>“I’d never thought about finance, but I found I was okay at it,” Blood said. Over the next decade, he thrived. After his first job, with Bankers Trust, he went to Harvard Business School. His most formative experience there came during the summer between his first and second year, when he worked for the then-famous, now-defunct (through merger) brokerage firm E. F. Hutton. “Everything about the culture seemed wrong to me,” he said. “Everything was short-term-focused, with no sense of what would help the client in the long run.” This was around the time that a young bond trader named Michael Lewis was observing something similar at the also now-defunct Salomon Brothers. Lewis converted his insights into his first book, <I>Liar’s Poker</I>.</P><P>Blood developed an enduring interest in the way a firm’s internal culture governed its success. “There were companies that had the same toxic short-term culture in those days—Drexel, Salomon, Bear Stearns, Kidder, Lehman,” he told me. “They’re all gone. If you look at what happened to them, it was all failures of culture: governance, leadership, incentive structures, values. That’s why they failed. And that was the beginning of my view that long-term business success requires a holistic view, involving teamwork, integrity, values.”</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-16""><P>He said he found the values he was looking for at Goldman Sachs, a firm that then prided itself on a noblesse-oblige culture of putting its investors’ interests first. Blood rose in the organization, was transferred to London, and by the time he met Al Gore in 2003 had become the head of Goldman’s asset-management division, overseeing 1,600 people and managing $325 billion in investments. He had also become a U.K. citizen, although unlike some other Yankee expats he does not sound ersatz British when he talks.</P><P>Just when Gore was turning to Goldman Sachs for advice on buying the Swiss asset-management firm, Blood was preparing to leave. Their mutual friend at the firm introduced Blood to Gore, and they immediately agreed they should work together. “It was obvious that we were both searching for the same holy grail,” Gore told me, “which was a way to manage assets with sustainability built into every part of the model.”</P><P>
They considered buying the Swiss firm and other possibilities, but finally agreed that their best chances lay with what Gore calls the “long, slow approach”: starting their own company, whose structure, values, analytic approach, and payment schemes would be designed the way they wanted. In early 2004 they founded Generation with five other like-minded partners. They spent the rest of that year establishing the firm’s operating rules, objectives, and even its own new vocabulary, which they considered important for a group determined to reconceive investment.

</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-17""><P>To get this out of the way: The obvious joke about their collaboration is that the firm should have been named Blood and Gore. The joke is so obvious that nearly everyone I spoke with about Generation mentioned it. Overobviousness, along with forced jocularity, no doubt helps explain why the founders chose a different name. But Gore and Blood both emphasized another reason, which reflects the values they hoped to build into the firm: There were seven partners, not two, at its founding. Gore and Blood are now first among equals, as chairman and senior partner, respectively. (Gore spends about a week a month at Generation’s office in London, and several more days at its office in New York. He joins, by phone, weekly management-committee meetings, and he told me that he spends part of nearly every day in online or telephone contact with Generation analysts.) In the details of its daily work, Generation incorporates a team-based rather than star-dominated approach to decision making.</P><P>***</P><H3><SPAN class=""smallcaps""><B>How It Works</B></SPAN></H3><P>In practice, seeing more of the spectrum involves a disciplined, complex, multilevel process, which I heard about in London. I’ll highlight just three of its aspects.</P><P><I>The road map.</I> The starting point for many of Generation’s investment decisions is a set of “road map” reports, on the long-term business, environmental, and social aspects of emerging technologies or markets. The Generation team, which now numbers more than 60 people in London and another 11 in New York, has produced more than 100 of these reports, on topics ranging from the worldwide spread of diabetes to changes in the heating-and-air-conditioning industry, which (with elevators) can account for nearly half the total energy use in big cities. I am looking as I write at a report on the environmental and workforce implications of the rapid rise in data-storage centers, the physical incarnation of the “cloud.” Next to it is one on the “last mile” question of online commerce: how products ordered over the Internet make their way into customers’ hands, and whether the dynamics are more likely to make delivery companies—the postal service, FedEx and DHL, and eventually Lyft and Uber—into retailers, or instead convert retailers such as Costco and Walmart into their own deliverers. And another report on the environmental, workforce, and urban-planning ramifications of those models and others. I’ve read a lot of these reports now. When they touched on topics I knew about, such as the manufacturing supply chain in China, or the business future of the media and the political and social effects of that changed future, I thought they rang true. The rest gave me a better understanding of, say, sustainability issues in the fashion industry, and equipped me to learn more.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-18""><P>The company also runs occasional multiday “solutions summits” on major topics for its analysts, held at its headquarters in London and presided over by Gore. This June it held one on “The Future of Mobility,” meant to explore what changes in city planning, self-driving cars, battery and engine and drone technologies, business models like Uber’s, and other areas would mean for companies ranging from Tesla to Priceline. As I read the records of some past summits, I realized that they were more, well, holistic than events I’d heard of or seen elsewhere. Compared with those at universities or government agencies or think tanks, they were more tied to business opportunities. Compared with those at other financial firms, they took a broader historical and intellectual view.</P><P><I>The focus list.</I> Based on the road maps, summits, and other sources of guidance, Generation’s analysts begin researching specific companies. They travel to the headquarters and interview managers and board members. They tour factories; they learn about competitors. They check sites like Glassdoor.com, where former employees discuss what they liked and didn’t like about a firm.</P><P>Once a week, about 25 members of the analyst team sit around a big conference table in London to discuss a company that has been the target of such research. They know that at the end of the meeting, they will each be asked to assign the company a value on two scales, BQ and MQ. <I>BQ</I> stands for “business quality,” a measure of whether the firm is likely to enjoy better-than-average long-term profitability. Does it have a “moat” against competitors? Is its whole industry vulnerable to disruption? Does it have a strong enough brand to avoid ruinous price competition? <I>MQ</I> stands for “management quality,” which encompasses not merely the character and intelligence of the executives and board members but also how closely their personal interests are aligned with the firm’s. Do their payment schemes encourage them to cash out or front-load the company’s profits and thus underfund long-range investments? Are they respected or resented by employees at large? Built into both assessments is consideration of the company’s social and environmental effects. Neither a very profitable business with disastrous environmental side effects nor a well-meaning company with weak revenues would qualify for investment.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-19""><P>Presiding over these meetings are Generation’s two co–chief investment officers, Mark Ferguson and Miguel Nogales. I heard the shorthand “Mark and Miguel” at Generation almost as often as I heard references to “Al.” (No one there seems to call him “Vice President Gore”; they viewed my reflexive use of the term as a weird Americanism.) Ferguson and Nogales, both in their 40s, make up an odd-couple leadership team. Nogales grew up in southern Spain, in a family of doctors and medical professors. He came to England for high school and then went to Cambridge, where he earned a degree with highest honors in economics. If you had to guess, based on bearing and diction, who at Generation was from the English upper class, you would choose the man from Spain.</P><P>Mark Ferguson is a Scot who says he finished high school only because he injured his knee in a soccer game when he was 16 and gave up his dream of going pro. “I come from a football family,” he told me. This was wry understatement: His father is the longtime Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, probably more recognizable on a London street than Al Gore.</P></SECTION><FIGURE class=""full-width"" style=""max-width: 960.0px;""><FIGCAPTION class=""caption"">Mark Ferguson (left) and Miguel Nogales (right), Generation’s chief investment officers, with David Blood in their London office. September 8, 2015. (Christopher Griffith)</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><SECTION id=""article-section-20""><P>Both Ferguson and Nogales went into finance early and thrived. But in their 30s each was looking for a way to combine it with his environmental and social-justice interests. Ferguson had worked, at different times, with both Blood and Nogales; Blood introduced them both to Gore; and in 2004 they were all part of the founding team. (The other three founders were a young asset manager named Colin le Duc; Gore’s former chief of staff, Peter Knight; and Peter Harris, of Goldman Sachs.)</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-21""><P>At the focus-list meeting I attended, Ferguson and Nogales guided the conversation rather than weighing in themselves, taking care to draw out even the soft-spoken or introverted analysts and those less comfortable in English. The business under discussion at that session was a well-known U.S.-based technology firm, which I am not supposed to name. On the good side, it held a wide market lead, and some of its technologies had shown potential in helping low-capital entrepreneurs in Africa, India, and elsewhere. On the bad side, other technologies might leapfrog its entire market category. Analysts argued the pros and cons. And was the pay structure likely to keep the best executives on board? An analyst making a case about the strengths of a company is also supposed to prepare an imagined corporate obituary, listings the things that went wrong and led the company to fail.</P><P>When it came time to vote on business quality and management quality, everyone around the table held out a closed fist, palm down. Then, on a count of three—“rock-paper-scissors” style—each person at the table put out one to five fingers, ranking first the company’s BQ and then its MQ. This company got a BQ3 and an MQ3.</P><P>“We came up with the rock-paper-scissors plan because we found that if Miguel or I indicated our feelings, that would inevitably steer things,” Ferguson told me.</P><P>What struck me when the process was over was what I had not heard during the long back-and-forth: namely, any mention of the company’s stock price. “That would really be frowned on at this stage of discussion,” Nogales said when I mentioned this to him the next day. “It would suggest a misunderstanding of what we’re trying to do.”</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-22""><P>He meant separating the judgment about whether a company is sustainably profitable from the decision about when to buy its shares. The initial judgment is made, collectively, at the focus-list meeting. If a company scores 3 or better on <I>both</I> measures, it is added to Generation’s focus list. That list now has about 125 entries. These are the firms whose stock prices and earnings Ferguson and Nogales watch closely, so they can buy if and when the price falls into what they consider an attractive range.</P><P>Some companies have been on the list for years but have never become cheap enough to buy. Nogales told me, for example, about a European biotech firm that Generation considers a top-ranked BQ1/MQ1. Unfortunately, the rest of the investing public has also recognized its virtues, keeping the price too high. In other cases Ferguson and Nogales have bought when the price was right—and then kept buying as the price went into a slump. For instance, in 2007 Generation bought 5 percent of the total shares of Kingspan, an Irish company that had invented a dramatically effective form of building insulation. During the ensuing collapse of the world’s construction business, the company’s share price plummeted from 22 euros all the way down to 2. Generation increased its holdings as the shares fell; the price is now back in the 20s.</P><P>“Our sustainability analysis has given us the conviction to have very concentrated positions in companies we think have the right long-term earning potential,” Nogales told me. Some of these bets have gone wrong—an early stake in First Solar, an Arizona-based company whose solar panels were underpriced by Chinese competitors and whose business results fell short of Generation’s assumptions. But enough have gone right to give Generation the performance record on which it is now making its case.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-23""><P><I>Active ownership. </I>This is the third distinctive trait of the Generation approach. Mark Ferguson said that in a normal firm, 80 percent of the attention is on the buy decision and 20 percent on the sell, leaving zero percent for <I>owning</I> shares in a company. From Gore and Blood on down, everyone I spoke with at Generation said they viewed the attention scale entirely differently. Their real responsibilities began rather than ended when they bought shares of a firm.</P><P>Generation officials meet with board members and managers of companies they invest in, explaining exactly what they like about the business and what kinds of decisions they’re hoping to see. “We talk directly with them about compensation levels, about board structure, about sustainability practices they are considering,” Nogales said. “Typically board members and CEOs will tell us that we’re the first institutional investors ever to talk about these issues. You should not underestimate the influence this can have on CEOs. We are trying to give cover to people who want to do things in a different way.”</P><P>***</P><H3><SPAN class=""smallcaps""><B>Reinventing Capitalism?</B></SPAN></H3><P>At Generation, I could tell that I had slightly hurt Mark Ferguson’s, Miguel Nogales’s, and David Blood’s feelings by not acting more awestruck at what I was seeing. To me, the analyst reports and discussions resembled good versions of what I’d seen and heard over the years from scientists discussing opportunities and obstacles in a field they knew well, or entrepreneurs weighing prospects for a new business. The Generation officials emphasized that if I had spent more of my life in the financial world, I would understand how profoundly their deliberative process varied from the investment-house norm. In particular, it was not based on a star system, in which leading analysts cultivate their contacts and play their hunches. Nor did it involve the normal sort of quantitative analyses of general market trends.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-24""><P>“If you want to get an idea of the difference, spend a few minutes watching CNBC,” Blood told me. Pay systems at financial firms are typically based on year-by-year or even quarter-by-quarter profits; staff turnover is rapid, driven by higher pay offers elsewhere. Bonuses for Generation’s investment team are based on its funds’ performance over a three-year period. Annual turnover has been about 3 percent through Generation’s history, very low for the financial world.</P><ASIDE class=""pullquote instapaper_ignore"">“When a new model … shows consistent results that beat the average, that model is sought after,” Gore says.</ASIDE><P>When I was able to look at the complete focus list of 125 companies under ongoing consideration, and public U.S., U.K., and European regulators’ reports on the companies in which Generation holds active positions, I was at first puzzled about just what made this lineup so special. Of the three dozen companies in which Generation reported holdings as of June 30, its largest holding was in Microsoft. No. 2 was Qualcomm, the leading chip maker for the mobile-phone industry, and the top 10 also included Google and the company that makes John Deere tractors.</P><P>I asked David Blood how this constituted any kind of reinvention of capitalism. He reminded me that Generation was trying to realize two goals usually considered contradictory: making a lot of money and supporting <mark>sustainable</mark> businesses. Every company on the focus list—big or small, household name or obscure start-up—had passed Generation’s internal test of offering good long-term business prospects. The big, familiar names were in one way or another advancing a sustainability goal. Microsoft, according to Nogales, met the test of “providing goods and services consistent with a low-<mark>carbon</mark>, healthy, fair, and safe society,” while also being (in Generation’s perhaps contrarian view) an attractive long-term business. Qualcomm was notable for its market position and its leadership in clean manufacturing and energy-efficient processing chips. John Deere? Equipment that supported “precision agriculture,” which could increase crop yields while reducing demand for energy, water, and chemical inputs. For the past six years Generation has held shares in Unilever, which it considers a proponent of <mark>sustainable</mark> agriculture around the world. A major cause of deforestation throughout the tropics is clearing forests to open land for palm-oil plantations, and the market for palm oil is dominated by big companies like Unilever, P&amp;G, Nestlé, and L’Oréal. Unilever, the single largest palm-oil purchaser, has coordinated international efforts toward <mark>sustainable</mark> palm-oil production.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""article-section-25""><P>Once I looked past the likes of Microsoft and Qualcomm, I saw that about a third of the companies on Generation’s holdings list, and the great majority of those on its larger focus list, were ones I had simply never heard of before, even in fields I felt familiar with. I asked about them and learned that many made ambitious environmental or social-benefit claims. For instance: Ocado, an online-only grocery company based in England, has no physical stores. It claims to be able to deliver your selections to your house for a lower total energy/<mark>carbon</mark> cost than if you walked to a store yourself, and at much greater savings than if you drove. (Main reason: It avoids the extreme energy intensity of operating a chain of normal grocery stores, where the cooling and heating systems are working against each other, and where so much fresh food goes unsold and spoils. Instead Ocado uses an Amazon-esque model of stocking food in its own few warehouses, where rapid stock turnover minimizes spoilage. The energy costs of its sophisticated home-delivery network are less than those of a chain’s distribution system.) A firm called Ansys, based in the small Pennsylvania town of Canonsburg, has developed simulation software that allows engineering companies to skip many stages of creating physical prototypes, thus saving time, energy, and materials. Other Ansys products allow companies to model and reduce the environmental effects of their operations. Linear Technology, based in Milpitas, California, north of San Jose, dominates the market for sensors and related devices for electric and hybrid vehicles (which can use five to 10 times as many of them, per vehicle, as conventional cars).</P><P>I asked about many other companies and heard many similar rationales. Some concerned a firm’s environmental or public-health effects; others, exceptional market power. All arose from the long BQ/MQ analytical approach.</P><P>When I pressed Gore and Blood on whether this assortment of companies, plus Generation’s undeniably successful first-decade performance record, had more than niche significance, they said they recognized the risks of overstating their achievement. But they said it should not be underappreciated, because they had provided at least one counterexample to the assumption that reducing the destructive side effects of modern capitalism would necessarily mean reducing its success. Political strategies change when a candidate comes out of nowhere to win. Coaches and athletes must adapt after losses if they hope to win again. The Generation strategy had proved a winner by the standards capitalism cares about most.</P><P>“When a new model appears that shows consistent results that beat the average, that model is sought after,” Gore told me. “Even if most assets are still allocated to index funds or by algorithmic traders, a prime part of the world’s assets are reserved for managers who think they can beat the market. That is what we have done. Our goal is to show that sustainability is a ‘best practice’ for doing this, and thus for changing the culture of the investment marketplace. I know that sounds pretty grandiose, but it’s our aim.”</P><P>Many other people suggested to me that world finance is ready for such a push. Laurence Fink, of BlackRock, said that he wrote his open letter to CEOs because “I truly believe we need to have inclusive capitalism, progressive capitalism”—a system that can be “stronger, more resilient, more equitable, and better able to deliver the <mark>sustainable</mark> growth the world needs.” Fink said that countless pressures, from hyper-fast automated trading to the frenzied tone of cable-news coverage, were steering managers toward destructively shortsighted behavior. “We decided that we needed to be a countervailing voice, to say that as your largest shareholder, we’re going to raise expectations about how you behave.”</P><P>Dominic Barton, of McKinsey, has written extensively about the leverage that investors and boards can have in deterring short-term, un<mark>sustainable</mark> corporate behavior. With Fink and other asset managers from Europe, North America, Asia, and elsewhere, Barton has been organizing an effort to convert major investors to a longer-term outlook. “We have something like $10 trillion in investable assets lined up here,” he told me. “This is not a small-potatoes amount, and it can send a very powerful signal.” Laura Tyson, of Berkeley, says that sustainability strategies of one kind or another are now “by far the fastest-growing category of assets under management.”</P><P>In his book <I>Capitalism 4.0</I>, published in the wake of the worldwide crash of 2008–09, the British financial writer Anatole Kaletsky argued that capitalism has survived so long because of its ability to adapt and mutate. In times of deep crisis—the brutal inequality of the first Gilded Age, the mass unemployment of the 1930s, financial instability and environmental pressures today—governments sooner or later intervene. “At these historic moments, when the capitalist system appears to be in its death-throes, it also seems incapable of radical reform,” he wrote. But just then, “politics kicks in to shake up institutional structures … [and] a reformed version of capitalism takes shape.”</P><P>“Reform” sounds boring and earnestly high-minded, criticisms that have been applied to Al Gore as well. But having lost some of the major fights in his life, he has earned consideration for the implications of this win.</P></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

In the US, for example, companies must disclose the subject of their lobbying, but do not have to disclose the position that they are lobbying for. This incomplete reporting opens them to concerns from consumers and investors.</P><P>In an age of increasing transparency, business leaders can expect more scrutiny, especially as concerns about the <mark>climate</mark> grow. While the politics and policies of <A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/<mark>sustainable</mark>-business/<mark>climate</mark>-change""><mark>climate change</mark></A> may be complicated, the message to a CEO is simple: there should be no question about where your company stands on <mark>climate policy</mark>.</P><P><A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/business/ikea"">Ikea</A> Group has gotten the message, and is moving toward a transparent <mark>climate change</mark> policy. The company recently articulated its positions in <A href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/213487609/IKEA-position-on-EU-2030-package-infograph"">this infographic</A>. Thanks to internal <A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/<mark>sustainable</mark>-business/leadership"">leadership</A> and partnerships with NGOs like WWF and the <mark>Climate</mark> Group, IKEA can now explain why <mark>climate change</mark> is relevant to its business interests and which policy actions it supports. Most importantly, it is taking these messages directly to policymakers throughout Europe, lobbying for ambitious, legally-binding 2030 targets for <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions, renewable power and energy efficiency.</P><H3>A Silent Majority</H3><P>While some companies are stepping forward on <mark>climate change</mark> policy, many others have remained quiet. There are a variety of reasons for this silence. Some are wary of staking out a position on a politically-charged topic that might alienate customers. Others offer tepid public support, while privately lobbying against <mark>climate change</mark> policy. Many are simply struggling internally to understand business risks and opportunities, ensure consistent messaging, and find the capacity to engage in <mark>climate policy</mark> debates. However, regardless of the reason for their silence, <A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/<mark>sustainable</mark>-business/us-business-leaders-<mark>climate</mark>-change-silence"">some critics</A> have argued that it prevents essential political breakthroughs on <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>So why (and how) are companies like Ikea stepping up to inform and advance <mark>climate policy</mark>? More importantly, what can other companies do to articulate their positions and demonstrate their leadership? My colleagues and I at the World Resources Institute worked with the United Nations and several esteemed partners on a <A href=""http://caringfor<mark>climate</mark>.org/"">Caring for <mark>Climate</mark></A> report to answer these questions and create a common standard for engaging responsibly in <A href=""http://www.wri.org/publication/guide-responsible-corporate-engagement-<mark>climate</mark>-policy""><mark>climate policy</mark> debates</A>. This guide, which is informed by business leaders, policymakers, investors, and NGOs from nearly two dozen countries, represents a baseline for action and transparent reporting.</P><P>Continued silence or perceived inconsistencies put companies at risk. As <A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/business/ford"">Ford's</A><A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/<mark>sustainable</mark>-business/blog/ford-lobbying-keystone-xl-pipeline-corporate-environmental-disclosures"">recent link to Keystone XL</A> shows, a lack of clarity fuels suspicion, speculation and distrust.</P><P>Shareholders and other stakeholders want to understand if and how companies support strong policy action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to a changing <mark>climate</mark>. And, as Anne Kelly of Ceres has noted, silence does not equal neutrality: industry associations and other powerful interest groups can claim to be speaking for those companies who do not speak for themselves.</P><H3>Increasing Attention and Interest</H3><P>Investors are asking more questions. CDP, which is backed by more than 750 institutional investors representing more than $90tn in assets, is gathering information about corporate lobbying for the second year in a row. In 2014, it plans to extend its scope, scoring the quality of the disclosures that it receives. The group is currently exploring how to factor these responses into overall performance scores over time.</P><P>Meanwhile, outside groups are looking closer at what companies are saying and doing on <mark>climate policy</mark>. the <A href=""http://blog.ucsusa.org/companies-trade-groups-and-<mark>climate</mark>-change-why-we-need-an-sec-rule-on-corporate-political-disclosure-380"">Union of Concerned Scientists</A> has been reviewing companies' and industry groups' actions and influences, and calling out inconsistencies between their public positions and those of their lobbyists.</P><P>Other organizations are exploring the possibility of updating past studies, like SustainAbility's <A href=""http://www.sustainability.com/library/influencing-power#.U0Qat_a1n4g"">Influencing Power</A>. Another option that some are exploring is benchmarking companies to establish leaders and laggards.</P><H3>Actions Speak Loudest</H3><P>The bottom line for companies is that it pays to be proactive. Businesses that clarify their positions and are transparent about their influences can avoid any questions from investors, customers and NGOs. Further, supporting policies to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions now, instead of delaying for a few more years, would avoid some $5tn in additional costs, according to the <A href=""http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/media/weowebsite/2013/energy<mark>climate</mark>map/RedrawingEnergy<mark>Climate</mark>Map.pdf"">International Energy Agency</A>.</P><P>Being proactive means identifying where <mark>climate change</mark> creates long-term risks and opportunities. It means ensuring that a company's lobbyists, and its industry groups' lobbyists, are pulling in the same direction as the company's long-term interests. These actions help ensure consistent, transparent engagement. A company can:</P><OL><LI><P><STRONG>Clarify its position:</STRONG> Companies like Microsoft have issued <A href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/microsoft-green/archive/2013/08/15/powering-forward.aspx"">public statements</A> to clarify that their membership in <mark>climate</mark>-change denying industry groups like Alec &quot;is not an endorsement&quot; of their views on <mark>climate</mark> or energy policies.

Broader partnership groups, like the UN's <A href=""http://caringfor<mark>climate</mark>.org/"">Caring for <mark>Climate</mark></A> initiative, also help companies connect with high-level officials and ministers to discuss <mark>climate policy</mark> priorities.

CEOs at Ford, Goldman Sachs, Nike, and Starbucks spoke out against them.</P><P>When Indiana and North Carolina curbed anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people, leaders of big companies strongly objected. PayPal <A href=""http://hrc-assets.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com//files/assets/resources/NC_CEO_Letter_%283%29.pdf"">canceled plans</A> to expand in North Carolina, and the NBA moved its all-star game out of Charlotte.</P><P>But as President Trump prepares to back away from the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement, roll back the Obama administration’s signature <mark>climate change</mark> initiatives, and appoint an Environmental Protection Agency administrator who has repeatedly fought the agency, the leaders of corporate America have for the most part been muted or silent.</P><P>This poses a problem for environmentalists and their allies in Congress, particularly on the <mark>climate</mark> issue. </P><P>U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat and a persistent advocate for <mark>climate change</mark> action, puts it this way: “One of the dirty secrets that we have to live with is that even the good-guy corporations don’t show up in Congress to lobby for doing something about <mark>climate change</mark>. Collectively, they do zero or less than zero to support <mark>climate</mark> legislation… That leaves the field to the bad guys.” </P><P>Without support from business, the environmental movement will struggle to defend itself against what David Goldston, director of government affairs for the Natural Resources Defense Council, calls an “incredible onslaught from both Congress and the administration.” What’s more, if environmentalists are to have any chance of convincing the federal government to enact stronger laws or regulations to curb <mark>climate change</mark> — a long shot, admittedly, for now — they will need big companies to use their political clout to turn around the Republicans who control Congress and the White House.</P><P>The reluctance of Fortune 500 companies to speak up on behalf of environmental protection is striking because it comes after decades of efforts by environmental nonprofits, ranging from The Nature Conservancy to Greenpeace, to develop partnerships with business. This work has paid off: Many companies have pledged to reduce their own <mark>carbon</mark> footprints, curb waste, and buy renewable energy. But few are willing to spend political capital on behalf of the environment.</P></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--pullquoteBlock""><BLOCKQUOTE class=""article__pullquote"">Why aren’t companies “speaking out more against the Trump administration’s ‘alternative facts’ on <mark>climate</mark>?”</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--textBlock""><P>The nomination of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA is a case in point. “He’s not just bad on one thing,” says Fred Krupp, president of the business-friendly Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). “He’s bad on everything.” It’s the first time that EDF has campaigned against an EPA nominee, but the group has few business allies in the battle.</P><P>Tom Murray, an EDF vice president who works closely with business, says he hopes that “pragmatic business voices” will eventually step up to influence the Trump administration. “At this point, however, companies are hanging back on engaging in policy and politics,” he says. “Companies are trying to make sense of the new political landscape, concerned about becoming the president’s next social media target, and enticed by the potential of regulatory and tax reform.”</P><P>A business affiliate of the Natural Resources Defense Council called E2 (it stands for “environmental entrepreneurs”) did put together a letter from “<A href=""https://members.e2.org/jsp/controller?docName=petition(AlertPruittNomEPA)"">500 business leaders</A>” who oppose Pruitt, but the signatories include a registered nurse, a physical therapist, and not a single big-company CEO. </P><P>Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director, says big business needs to step up. “It simply makes no sense that big companies like Coke, Microsoft, Google, and other companies that care about and are doing great things with clean energy and sustainability aren’t speaking out more against the Trump administration’s ‘alternative facts’ on <mark>climate change</mark> and a national energy plan that will only increase our dependence on fossil fuels,” he says.</P><P>Worse, at least for environmentalists, some companies are actively turning against their erstwhile allies. Two days after Trump was elected, the Alliance of American Automobile Manufacturers, which represents Ford and General Motors, among others, urged the president’s transition team to roll back stringent fuel economy rules that were agreed to by the carmakers early in the Obama years. Environmentalists were stunned.</P><P>Says Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a nonprofit alliance of environmentalists and investors: “General Motors is doing a lot of good things on waste, they’re committed to 100 percent renewables, they’re supportive of the Paris talks. But on fuel economy standards, they like this new administration.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--pullquoteBlock""><BLOCKQUOTE class=""article__pullquote"">In 2016, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google all donated more money to Republicans than Democrats.</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--textBlock""><P>Meantime, as the political winds have shifted rightwards, so have campaign contributions from corporate political action committees (PACs). In 2016, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, and Google — all of which had previously favored Democratic congressional candidates over Republicans — donated more money to Republicans than Democrats. Congressional Republicans have united to oppose plans to regulate the greenhouse gases that cause <mark>climate change</mark> since 2008.</P><P>All of this means that, when it comes to <mark>climate change</mark>, the loudest business voices in Washington belong to the fossil fuel industry and powerful trade associations, notably the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, that have staunchly opposed <mark>climate</mark> regulation. The chamber’s board includes executives from Accenture, Allstate Insurance, AT&amp;T, Caterpillar, Dow Chemical, FedEx, Florida Power &amp; Light, and Pfizer, all of which have pledged to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions. Public pension funds and so-called socially responsible investors have <A href=""http://www.ott.ct.gov/PolicyAndEducation/LettertoCompaniesAddressing<mark>Climate</mark>Change.pdf"">called on chamber members</A> to “address any misalignment between their own positions and actions on <mark>climate change</mark> and their funding of the chamber’s actions,” to little apparent effect.</P><P>To be sure, some big companies have backed up their <mark>climate change</mark> rhetoric with action in Washington. In 2009, Apple left the U.S. chamber over its <mark>climate change</mark> position and Nike resigned from the chamber board, citing the <mark>climate</mark> issue. Last year, Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft filed a legal brief in federal court supporting the EPA’s Clean Power Plan. General Mills, Mars, and Starbucks have lobbied side-by-side with Ceres on <mark>climate</mark> issues. </P><P>Since the election, Ceres, World Wildlife Fund, and a group called We Mean Business recruited a large number of small companies and a small number of large ones — Campbell Soup, DuPont, Gap, General Mills, HP, Intel, Kellogg, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Mars, Mondelez, Monsanto, Staples, Starbucks, and Unilever, among them — to <A href=""http://www.low<mark>carbon</mark>usa.org/"">sign a letter</A> asking the new administration to affirm its commitment to the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement.

In a statement, Google explained its donations to Republican <mark>climate</mark> skeptics by saying: “Google engages on a wide variety of public policy issues and we work with policymakers and advocacy groups across the political spectrum. We’re never going to agree 100% with every organization or policymaker on every issue.” </P></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--pullquoteBlock""><BLOCKQUOTE class=""article__pullquote"">Corporations do not want to become a target of a president who is willing to call out individual companies by name.</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--textBlock""><P>Gary Garfield, who recently retired as CEO of Bridgestone Tire, is one chief executive who did step up, wrangling senior executives in the tire industry to call for strong <mark>climate</mark> action.

CEOs don’t want to unnecessarily aggravate political allies, shareholders, or employees over an issue that “doesn’t really directly affect their business,” he notes.
  </P><P>The Trump presidency complicates the calculus for businesses that need to manage an array of Washington issues, insiders say. “Companies absolutely care about <mark>climate change</mark>, but they care about other things too,” says Ceres’ Lubber. “They are balancing and juggling.” Corporations want Trump and the Republican Congress to support corporate tax cuts and infrastructure spending, and they do not want to become a target of a president who has been willing to call out individual companies by name. 
  </P><P>“Companies see a bully in the schoolyard, and they are off in the corner, doing their homework, and hoping the bully picks on someone else,” says Aron Cramer, the president and CEO of BSR, a network of businesses dedicated to sustainability. But, he says, business leaders understand the importance of <mark>climate policy</mark>, and they will speak up: “The underlying fundamentals will cause business to sustain their <mark>climate</mark> commitments and ultimately to be more vocal about those commitments.”

On a day when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared the first three months of 2016 had been the hottest such months on record, Lubber said the Paris Agreement is “extraordinary” in its scope and vision.</P><P>“The fact that we are signing this particular deal should be marked as the world’s greatest start,” she said.</P><P>Representatives of more than 150 nations will sign the Paris Agreement in New York City tomorrow (<EM><A href=""https://www.eenews.net/<mark>climate</mark>wire/2016/04/21/stories/1060036011"" target=""_blank"">see related story</A></EM>).</P><P>Hundreds of companies voiced their support for the Paris deal leading up to tomorrow’s ceremony, while blue-chip firms that spend millions of dollars on energy costs, and whose predecessors likely opposed <mark>climate</mark> regulations, now back <mark>carbon</mark>-cutting efforts.</P><P>Some corporations have even pledged to protect U.S. EPA’s keystone <mark>climate</mark> regulation against challenges in the courts (<A href=""https://www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1060034925/"" target=""_blank""><EM>EnergyWire</EM></A>, April 1).</P><P>“What’s exciting to us is seeing how many companies are getting in the game,” said Michael Terrell, senior policy counsel for energy and sustainability at Google. This month, Google joined Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. and <mark>Microsoft Corp.</mark> in filing a legal <A href=""https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/content/2016.04.01_major_tech_companies_amicus_brief_for_epa.pdf"" target=""_blank"">brief</A> in support of EPA’s Clean Power Plan.</P><P>Google, officially now called Alphabet Inc., committed to purchasing more than 2 gigawatts’ worth of renewable energy. That target would make the tech giant the largest purchaser of renewable energy worldwide that isn’t a utility, Terrell said.</P><P>“I think we’ve seen more momentum than we have ever before,” he said of the businesses backing <mark>climate</mark> regulation. “We have a strong commitment from the private sector.”</P><H2>Industry stepping up</H2><P>More than 100 companies—including brand-name firms like Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., HP Inc., Johnson &amp; Johnson, L’Oreal SA’s American division and salesforce.com inc.—yesterday in a <A href=""http://low<mark>carbon</mark>usa.org/"" target=""_blank"">letter</A> endorsed the Paris deal and U.S. EPA’s Clean Power Plan. The regulation was a critical component for U.S. negotiators to secure international support during the Paris talks.</P><P>“They are all speaking in the same voice,” Lubber said. These 110 companies “want low-<mark>carbon</mark> power” and stable energy supplies, she said.</P><P>In a separate supportive <A href=""http://investorson<mark>climate</mark>change.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160418-Early-entry-into-force-PUBLIC.pdf"" target=""_blank"">statement</A> last week, more than 400 institutional investors together managing more than $24 trillion in assets urged governments to support the expansion of low-<mark>carbon</mark> fuel sources, establish “economically meaningful” <mark>carbon</mark> prices and craft plans to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies.</P><P>“The Paris Agreement is an historic breakthrough that delivered an unequivocal signal for investors,” they wrote.</P><P>“[The accord] provides the right framework to trigger substantial investment and thus keep the door open to a well-below 2 degrees pathway,” they added, referencing what is widely accepted to be the largest temperature increase possible without inciting catastrophic <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>A handful of energy-industry companies operating in the U.S. market—Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Calpine Corp., PG&amp;E Corp., Rio Tinto PLC, Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Siemens AG among them—<A href=""http://www.c2es.org/docUploads/BUSINESS%20STATEMENT.pdf"" target=""_blank"">urged</A> politicians to move swiftly to enforce the Paris Agreement, too.</P><P>A robustly implemented Paris deal would ease the world’s business community into an economy no longer reliant on fossil fuels, they said.</P><P>In the coming decades, humanity will “see Paris as the turning point between the <mark>carbon</mark> economy and the clean economy,” IKEA Chief Sustainability Officer Steve Howard said. “This was a systemic, global economywide effort to de<mark>carbon</mark>ize.”</P><P>IKEA has long spoken of its efforts to cut energy use. The Swedish furniture maker is 70 percent of its way to its goal of powering all its operations with renewables by 2020. It aims to reuse or recycle 90 percent of its waste by 2020 and also sells solar panels in three markets. The company will add solar panel products to nine more markets in the next year and a half, Howard said.</P><P>“We’re looking deep into our supply chain,” he said, “to chase out every ton of <mark>carbon</mark>.”</P><P>Still, the task of mobilizing enough investment to curb <mark>climate change</mark> is daunting.</P><P>The World Bank said last year that the global economy must rouse $90 trillion for spending on infrastructure, energy and land-use projects to prevent global temperatures from climbing more than 2 degrees Celsius.</P><H2>Critics blast ‘command and control’ regs</H2><P>But some industry organizations aren’t keen on what international leaders hammered out in Paris.</P><P>“U.S. manufacturers believe in the spirit of the agreement reached in Paris to reduce and stabilize global GHG emissions,” said Ross Eisenberg, vice president of energy and resources policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, the industry’s largest trade group in the country.</P><P>“However, we continue to have great concerns over the domestic policies that have been and will be put into place to meet the commitments made in Paris,” he said. “Regulation or policy that is set by government should promote a competitive marketplace for manufacturers, which is our best weapon in the fight to prevent global <mark>climate change</mark>.”</P><P>In an emailed statement, the American Petroleum Institute said U.S. <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions are “near 20-year” lows.</P><P>“This has occurred without command and control style regulatory interference,” API said. “Our success is driven, not by government mandate or legislative fiat, but through <mark>innovation</mark>, investment and entrepreneurial spirit.”</P><P>A U.S. Chamber of Commerce spokesman provided a link to a blog post by Stephen Eule, who works at the chamber, in which Eule said the U.S. <mark>climate</mark> pledges that American representatives made in Paris were unrealistic.</P><P>The chamber and the National Association of Manufacturers are both challenging the Clean Power Plan in court.</P><H2>Industry interest still an uphill battle</H2><P>Since the United Nations held the first Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark> in Berlin in 1995, <mark>climate change</mark> has developed into a subtle but persistent theme of economic regulators, financial experts and private-sector leaders.</P><P>Starting early last year, officials at the Bank of England gave speeches on the financial damages of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Within financial circles, only insurers have traditionally really worried about <mark>climate change</mark> risks, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said recently at the World Bank.</P><P>“Delivery of COP 21 will truly change that,” he said.</P><P>Just one-third of “top companies” provide adequate disclosure of their <mark>climate</mark> risks. A private-sector group backed by the Group of 20 nations is trying to resolve that problem, but <mark>climate</mark> disclosure remains “fragmented and incomplete” (<A href=""https://www.eenews.net/<mark>climate</mark>wire/stories/1060034992/"" target=""_blank""><EM><mark>Climate</mark>Wire</EM></A>, April 4).</P><P>G-20 nations are also working to establish a bigger, more transparent green bond market this year, Carney said, telling listeners that the upside to such a pool of stable, steady-income assets would he tremendous.</P><P>Less than 1 percent of the roughly $100 trillion in fixed-income assets in institutional investors’ hands is “anything that would approximate a renewable or green finance,” he said. “So there’s plenty of capital.”</P><P>Carney continued: “What the financial sector needs is the push, the belief that that investment is going to take place in lower-<mark>carbon</mark> opportunities and then that expertise will come.”</P><P>The central bankers of France and Bangladesh, in the run-up to and shortly after the Paris summit, have warned that <mark>climate change</mark> should be monitored for economic hazards (<A href=""https://www.eenews.net/<mark>climate</mark>wire/stories/1060030673/"" target=""_blank""><EM><mark>Climate</mark>Wire</EM></A>, Jan. 15).</P><P>At Google and IKEA, which are in the vanguard of shifting money to low-emissions technologies, the decision is financially savvy, officials said.</P><P>Terrell of Google said powering electricity-hungry data centers with renewables guards against unexpected price spikes in fossil fuel costs. “Our business runs on energy,” he said.</P><P>At IKEA, Howard said, <mark>climate change</mark> has already left its mark—from extreme weather that has damaged cotton down its supply chain, flooding in India and Pakistan that disrupted supplies, too, and Superstorm Sandy, which cost the company $9 million in damage in Red Hook, Brooklyn.</P><P>Anirban Ghosh, chief sustainability officer at Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, a $17 billion Indian conglomerate active in 10 sectors, said India is experiencing all-time low levels of water currently, following two years of record heat that claimed hundreds of lives.</P><P>“The pursuit of low-<mark>carbon</mark> paths must be relentless,” he said. Sustainability is no longer deemed a cost, Ghosh said, but instead is being viewed as an opportunity “from a rejuvenation perspective.”</P><P><EM>Reprinted from <mark>Climate</mark>wire with permission from Environment &amp; Energy Publishing, LLC. <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/"" target=""_blank"">www.eenews.net</A>, 202-628-6500</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""article-author-container""><H3 class=""article-author-container__title"">ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)</H3></SECTION></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Sterling Burnett</A> to discuss the past and future of the Heartland Institute including his stepping down as President and <SPAN class=""caps"">CEO</SPAN> and his planned departure from the organization. Bast outlined some of the Institute's early work on <mark>climate change</mark>: <A href=""#s223"">[223]</A></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>[8:10] <EM><SPAN class=""caps"">HSB</SPAN>:</EM> “You mentioned <mark>climate</mark>. Let's get to that. Under your leadership, the Heartland Institute became a leader and has been recognized as such in the realm of <mark>climate</mark> science, economics, and policy. Why did the Heartland Institute become so deeply involved in this one issue? What did you see that others didn't about the importance of <mark>climate change</mark> as an issue, and what impact has Heartland's efforts had?”</P><P><SPAN class=""caps"">JB</SPAN>: “Well, Heartland started addressing <mark>climate</mark> actually way back, ah, 1994…1995. We did our first book that had a chapter on <mark>climate change</mark> in it. We addressed it primarily from an economic perspective, arguing that the cost of reducing emissions was really high compared to the sketchy evidence that we had about the cost of harms and offsetting benefits. Nobody listened to us. We did three, four, or five I thought really good policy studies on this topic looking specifically for example, at a <mark>carbon</mark> tax on agriculture, and the studies got almost no attention.</P><P>“It turns out the reason they got no attention is because people were afraid of catastrophic <mark>climate change</mark>. When the building is on fire, people don't argue or negotiate the price of fire extinguishers; they're all too busy running for the doors, and so we concluded that we had to put the fire out before we can get a reasonable conversation to take place here. We've got to address this underlying fear of catastrophic <mark>climate change</mark>. So we did a deep dive in 2007; we said, where is this fear coming from? Is it based on sound science? Who are the scientists who are in this debate? Do they need our help? Why aren't they getting a better hearing? And why aren't Cato, and Heritage, and <SPAN class=""caps"">AEI</SPAN>, and other think tanks engaged in this part of the debate? </P><P>“And what we learned was that virtually none of the free market think tanks were addressing the science. They weren't doing that because they felt it wasn't their job. They're mostly economists and lawyers and they didn't want to start getting into the physics of <mark>climate change</mark>. I respect that. But the result was a gap: there was no free market voice on the <mark>climate</mark> science debate that was taking place, and that was a critical error on the part of free market activists. Unless we address the science, we are going to lose this debate. </P><P>“So we recruited scientists from all around the country. We ended up producing the series called <mark>Climate Change</mark> Reconsidered for the Nongovernmental International Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>. We had a tremendous impact. I mean, it's quite remarkable. That book, that series of books, has been cited over 100 times in peer-reviewed articles. The Chinese Academy of Sciences thought so highly of it that it translated it into Chinese and published a condensed volume of <mark>Climate Change</mark> Reconsidered. </P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Bast also claimed credit to the Heartland Institute for both defeating cap and trade proposals, and for President Donald Trump's views on <mark>climate change</mark>: <A href=""#s223"">[223]</A></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“We, I think we're responsible—one of two or three groups that could genuinely claim responsibility for defeating cap and trade and <mark>carbon</mark> tax proposals at the national level for a ten year period, pretty much from 2007 until today. </P><P>I think we're the reason President Trump discovered, or concluded that <mark>climate change</mark> is not a real problem and not a crisis facing the country, and that by running on that—by defending coal miners for example—he could appeal to a very big base in the United States. People who expected all along that global warming was junk science, that they would rather have good jobs and inexpensive energy than pursue some liberal dream of, you know, replacing all fossil fuel with wind and solar power.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“So Trump ran on that. He won, and it's been remarkable: for the last year, he's been implementing many of the promises that he made as a candidate.” <A href=""#s223"">[223]</A></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Bast said he was “anxious about the future” given the possibility that Hillary Clinton could have won the election, but that Trump's victory gave the country “a second chance at freedom”:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“Now Donald Trump wasn't the first choice for most of us. He might not even have been the final choice, but the alternative was truly scary. You know, Hillary Clinton was committed to finishing what Barack Obama started, and that was pretty much destroying the local decentralized education system in America—replacing it with a centralized curriculum. Destroying the decentralized health care system that used to depend primarily on private insurance companies and doctors in private practice. So replacing that with Obamacare, destroying the financial sector.</P><P>“I mean all the commanding heights of a free society, President Obama targeted and did major damage for eight years, and for whatever reasons Congress and the courts didn't seem able to stop him. Hillary Clinton was committed to waging that war for another four years. I'm not sure we could have recovered from that. So we got a second chance at freedom with the election of Donald Trump. Incidentally I decided to step down, now, before the election of Donald Trump, so if anyone is wondering if that influenced my decision it didn't. But it was a second chance we probably didn't deserve to preserve freedom in America. It's very precarious. It is perched on an edge. And so I'm very anxious about the future of freedom,” Bast said.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Finally, Bast said that the Institute needs more money to grow: <A href=""#s223"">[223]</A></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“What will Heartland Institute's role be in that? I am optimistic. I think Heartland is going to grow. There's a much bigger niche for what we do than what I was able to raise money for to fill. You know, I raised about six million dollars a year for the Heartland Institute. We should be at eight or ten [million]. We should have twenty, twenty five guys working in our, just in our government relations office, working with state legislators, giving them the information that they need, testifying when they need testimony, helping them draft legislation. I mean, this is all exciting stuff that they're asking us to do and we don't have the staff to do it. </P><P>So I think under Tim Huelskamp's leadership we're going to raise that money. We're going to expand the staff and fill that niche. So Heartland should be doing well in future years. I only hope and pray that freedom in the United States is going to continue rising while the Heartland Institute is performing its job.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><STRONG>March 2, 2018</STRONG></P><P>At <A href=""https://www.libertycon.com/"">LibertyCon 2018</A>, Heartland Institute Research Director <A href=""https://www.heartland.org/about-us/who-we-are/edward-hudgins"">Edward Hudgins</A> told an attendee (in a conversation recorded at Heartland Institute’s conference booth)</P><P><SPAN class=""dquo"">“</SPAN>One of the reasons the Trump Administration pulled out of the Paris Accord was because of our materials… Now when Obama was in there, nobody wanted to hear from us.

This has been made possible through a partnership between the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Microsoft and the Andhra Pradesh government. The pioneering digital tools are released by ICRISAT with development undertaken by Microsoft. The Personalized Village Advisory Dashboard has been especially developed to enable officials of Andhra Pradesh Primary Sector Mission (APPSM) – Rythu Kosam, to better manage programs of scale.</P><P>“Bringing a lot of scattered data together and developing an analytical tool that is comprehensive and gives accurate predictions to the farmers, is urgently needed. We are excited to work with Microsoft to enhance incomes and improve the lives of small holder farmers, and this is going to boost our digital agriculture initiative in a big way,” said Dr. David Bergvinson, Director General of ICRISAT.</P><P>ICRISAT has adopted Microsoft Cortana Intelligence Suite including Machine Learning (ability of computers to learn without being specifically programmed) and Power BI or Business Intelligence, to empower farmers and government officials with technology, and promote digital farming practices in the state.</P><P>Commenting on this development, Anil Bhansali, Managing Director, Microsoft India (R&amp;D) Pvt. Ltd., said, “We are pleased to support ICRISAT to drive impact for farmers through our technology. Agriculture is a crucial economic contributor in India, and the implementation of advanced analytics in agriculture will help streamline and strengthen farming practices. The Sowing App and Personalized Village Advisory Dashboard are developed to provide powerful cloud-based predictive analytics to empower farmers with crucial information and insights to help reduce crop failures and increase yield, in turn, reducing stress and generating better income. We firmly believe in the potential of Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and Power BI to bring efficiencies not only in agriculture, but also in healthcare, education, and beyond. This is a significant start for digital agriculture and can reap benefits in multiple ways as governments and stakeholders discover the potential for technology to unlock and offer multiple solutions for famers.”</P><DIV id=""attachment_17140"" style=""width: 310px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Intelligent Sowing – SMS Service</P></DIV><P>The Sowing Application utilizes powerful artificial intelligence to interface with weather forecasting models provided by USA based aWhere Inc. and extensive data including rainfall over the last 45 years as well as 10 years of groundnut sowing progress data for Kurnool district. This data is then downscaled to build predictability and guide farmers to pick the ideal sowing week. When combined with other data collected from the Rythu Kosam project, it can create rich datasets that can be processed to build predictive models for the farmers.</P><P>Similarly, the Personalized Village Advisory Dashboard developed by Microsoft provides an instant overview across several environmental factors that determine a healthy crop yield. In the pilot that has been recently launched, information will be sent to farmers about the sowing date via SMS in Telugu. Data collected manually from farms in 13 districts of the state by ICRISAT field officers for Rythu Kosam has been uploaded to Microsoft’s Azure Cloud. Using powerful Business Intelligence (BI) tools, this dashboard provides important insights around soil health, fertilizer recommendations, and seven days’ weather forecast derived from the world’s best available weather observations systems and global forecast models. This data is then downscaled for the highest possible accuracy at the village level, to transform how small holder farmers tackle <mark>climate change</mark> to drive effective decision-making.</P><P>ICRISAT is providing technical backstopping to Rythu Kosam, which is aimed at positioning the state among the best three performing states by 2022. This technical input involves the establishment of pilot sites of learning in 13 districts of 10,000 ha each; upgrading soil analysis laboratories; technical support for planning; as well as adopting an Inclusive Market-Oriented Development (IMOD) strategy to benefit smallholder farmers through public-private partnerships; and promoting private investments in the state.</P><DIV class=""greennature-stunning-text-ux greennature-ux""><DIV class=""greennature-stunning-text-item type-normal with-padding "" style=""background-color:#f3f3f3;""><DIV class=""stunning-text-caption"" style=""color: #a0a0a0""><P align=""right""><STRONG>For more information, please contact:</STRONG></P><P align=""right"">Showkat Rather +91 8978882187 or r (dot) showkat (at) cgiar (dot) org or
