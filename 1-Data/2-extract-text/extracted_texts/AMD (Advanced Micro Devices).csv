As technologies advance at an unimaginable pace, the realisation that our resources are finite and our future is fragile has focused our minds on the precarious nature of our environment like never before. Global warming, erratic and unprecedented extremes in weather patterns, and the desperate search for <mark>sustainable</mark> solutions that guarantee our and our children's future make us concentrate our minds and focus our attention more than at any time previously.
</P><P>
Amongst <A href=""/"">IT professionals</A>, too, it has become apparent that environmentally <mark>sustainable</mark> systems and habits need to be discussed and disseminated as much as in other areas like transportation, heating, cooling and lighting, manufacturing, and waste disposal. The issue today is green computing.
</P><P> 
</P><H2>What is green computing?</H2><P>
Green computing is also known as green technology, by which the use of computers and related resources are as environmentally responsible as possible. Among a number of practices, there is the use of energy-efficient central processing units (CPUs), servers and peripherals. In addition, care is being taken to reduce resource consumption, along with ensuring the correct and safe disposal of electronic waste (e-waste).
</P><P>
Furthermore, there has been a paradigm shift, of late, from pure computing power being at the heart of computer chip design and manufacture to the issue of energy-efficient processing. With <mark>carbon</mark> footprints and <mark>climate change</mark> now at the forefront of IT developers' minds, this is where the new competitive focus lies. In one particular example, major developments are occurring in the area of high-performance gaming chips.
</P><P>
Only last week, AMD (formerly Advanced Micro Devices) announced the completion of an energy efficiency study on its own high-performance gaming chip that confirms it is almost three times more energy efficient per watt than its ancestors. The implication for computer gamers or, indeed, those involved in producing or watching high-end video graphics and who are sensitive to <mark>climate change</mark> issues, is that they can continue to indulge while feeling a little less culpable. It is not only AMD, though, but Intel and other chipmakers who are now competing to make energy-efficient chips and, of course, gain market advantage.
</P><P>
It is not just in chip manufacture, either. <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/resources/slashing-energy-use-computers-and-monitors-while-protecting-our-wallets-health-and-planet"" target=""_blank"">A recent report has shown that computers themselves could be far more energy-efficient</A>. The report's author, Pierre Delforge, points out that &quot;computers and monitors are among the biggest energy consumers among electronics. Keeping them running takes the equivalent of 30 large power plants while emitting 65 million metric tonnes of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide <mark>pollution</mark>. Unfortunately, much of that energy is wasted when computers sit idle — particularly with desktops, which draw power from a wall outlet instead of a battery and thus give manufacturers little incentive to optimise energy use&quot;.
</P><P>
In effect, greater energy savings and ecological benefit could be obtained if manufacturers of computer hardware were to make simple adjustments so that, for example, idling computers don't use the same amount of energy as when fully in use.
</P><P><A href=""https://www.greenbiz.com/article/amd-and-chip-makers-efforts-create-energy-efficient-cpus"" target=""_blank"">Commenting on the report</A>, Barbara Brady (of GreenBiz Group) writes that &quot;the energy waste — and therefore the potential for energy efficiency — is even a bigger deal for very high-performance computers, using very demanding chips. They continue to draw the power needed for the demanding computing activity of high-performance graphics even as the user stops to get a cup of coffee or slows down processing needs by simply surfing the net or checking email&quot;. 
</P><P>
No longer the wishy-washy idea of &quot;tree-huggers&quot;, green computing is very serious business today. Governments are involved, too, as evident in the <mark>Climate Change</mark> Agreement (CGA) and the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) which are persuading companies to re-evaluate the way they use their IT resources. Improving energy efficiency has moved from well-intentioned debate to stark reality for most UK businesses.
</P><P>
Furthermore, the <mark>Carbon</mark> Reduction Commitment (CRC) programme has <mark>carbon</mark> emission reduction at its heart: the UK target is a reduction by 1.2 tonnes by 2020. It is by using green technology that this mandatory UK standard seeks to improve energy efficiency through an 80% cut in UK <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by the year 2050. The CRC addresses all forms of energy – electricity, gas, fuel (except transportation) and oil. One immediate consequence of this directive is that companies will urgently need to hire or train up staff skilled in green technology if they are to meet the CRC's mandatory targets. For those wishing to understand the CRC scheme better, there is a handy tutorial: <A href=""http://www.computerweekly.com/tutorial/Understanding-the-CRC-Energy-Efficiency-Scheme"" target=""_blank"">http://www.computerweekly.com/tutorial/Understanding-the-CRC-Energy-Efficiency-Scheme</A>  
</P><P>
Government regulation, however, with the best will in the world, forms barely a fraction of all-encompassing green solutions, that need to be modified to achieve minimal adverse consequences for our environment.
</P><P>
To this end, finding and implementing ways to make energy (and consequently, cost) savings at a time of rising fuel prices is no longer only the preserve of corporate businesses, but increasingly a concern for private individuals. Public and corporate opinion has shifted in favour of environmental responsibility for some time but has been intensified more rapidly since <mark>climate change</mark> has become critical, both as a political and a practical issue.
</P><P>
As an area of human activity that has grown so much and so fast, computing is ripe for realistic environmental savings. While manufacturers are looking at improving hardware, computer users can implement relatively straight-forward practices even with existing hardware. In fact, there is even software to assist us, such as <A href=""http://www.littlegreengenie.com/"" target=""_blank"">Little Green Genie</A> that enables businesses and individuals to measure, reduce and <mark>carbon</mark> offset the emissions emanating from their computers.
</P><P> 
</P><H3>Practical steps</H3><P>
While much is happening at a macro level, there is plenty that can be done at the micro level. There are practical measures, both easy and user-friendly, that are available to all computer users, whether at work or at home. Consider:
</P><UL><LI>Wherever it is feasible to do so, utilise alternative (renewable) energy sources for computing workstations, networks, servers, and data centres</LI><LI>Energy-intensive peripherals should be powered-up and powered-down on a need-to-use basis</LI><LI>During long periods of inactivity, the CPU and all peripherals should be powered-down</LI><LI>For energy efficiency, notebook computers trump desktop computers every time</LI><LI>Whenever possible, do computer-related tasks during conterminous and concentrated blocks of time. Otherwise, leave the hardware switched off the rest of the time</LI><LI>Replace cathode-ray-tube (CRT) monitors with liquid-crystal-display (LCD) monitors</LI><LI>Get the power-management features to turn off hard drives and displays after shorter periods of inactivity</LI><LI>Go paperless wherever possible; otherwise, waste paper should be properly recycled</LI><LI>Dispose of e-waste legally and responsibly.</LI></UL><H3>Turn that thing off!</H3><P>
Your average desktop computer consumes approximately 8W of electricity per hour when shut down but not turned off. For a PC that is turned off for around 16 hours a day that is equivalent to a waste of 1KW of electricity a week. Remembering to turn off the computer, either at the back or at the wall socket when you aren't using it, results in a huge difference in energy consumption and its impact on the environment.
</P><P>
It is not enough to leave the computer on &quot;standby&quot; or even &quot;sleep&quot; mode, even though that does save quite a lot of power. Even shutting down a desktop computer does not, necessarily, turn it off, because while the power supply to the computer stays on, the motherboard remains partially powered, anticipating the signal to start again from the switch at the front of the computer (not to be confused with the mains power switch). To ensure that a computer really isn't using any power, it must be switched off at the wall socket.
</P><P>
There is more. While the above pointers are practical steps any computer user should take, Christopher Barnett has identified a number of further <A href=""http://explainingcomputers.com/green.html"" target=""_blank"">significant steps to decrease the environmental damage of computing and reduce energy consumption</A>. He lists six:
</P><OL><LI>Lower power hardware: involves using a lower power processor, onboard graphics, passive cooling (as opposed to fans) and a solid state drive (SSD) or a smaller hard drive than the ubiquitous 3,5&quot;.</LI><LI>Virtualisation: the use of computer software to simulate hardware. It can also be used at File level with file virtualization software enabling frequently accessed files to be stored on high-performance, low-capacity drives.</LI><LI>Cloud computing: allows software applications, processing power and data to be accessed via the Internet. It also enables everyone to enjoy the benefits of virtualisation.</LI><LI>Energy efficient coding: a way of saving power through software that doesn't use so much of the hardware.</LI><LI>Improved repair, re-use, recycling and disposal: unlike most machines, repairing computers or reusing as many parts as possible from broken PCs is highly feasible.</LI><LI>Less pollutant manufacture: a great many dangerous chemicals go into the making of computers. If hardware producers significantly reduced the use of such substances, it would <A href=""http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/guide-greener-electronics-8-edition.pdf"" target=""_blank"">protect people from exposure and make e-waste more safely recyclable</A>.</LI></OL><P>
With the speed of research and development of which we are now capable, it should only be a few years before the majority of computers will consume less power than is needlessly wasted at the moment.

As demand for a tech increases, its price goes down.</P></DIV><P><SPAN style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Tech Energy and Commodity Energy: Different Worlds</SPAN></P><P>Solar Photovoltaic (PV) as a means of deriving energy is fundamentally different from fossil fuel-based commodities (oil, coal and gas). Consider, a solar PV panel can be thought of as nothing more than a hugely oversized computer chip: a bunch of circuitry embedded in a silicon wafer. Indeed, in most economic sector classification schemes (GICS, etc.), PV manufacturers have often been defined as “semiconductors,” which is basically true (if misleading in other ways). So different are the driving economics behind tech-based and commodities-based means of deriving energy, we at Green Alpha are recommending to Standard &amp; Poor’s and MSCI that they consider formally separating the two into distinct sub-sectors.</P><P>Recently, though, the two types of energy – oil and solar – have been trading in tandem, both falling significantly since mid-2014. Traders by and large seem to be thinking “energy is energy.” But this energy-as-monolith view is not appropriate to the reality of the economics, and is not supported by the fundamentals.</P><P>To illustrate what I mean, a closer-to-valid comparison is that a solar PV company like First Solar, Inc. (TICKER: <A title=""First Solar, Inc."" href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/fslr"" target=""_blank"">FSLR</A>) should trade more like a chip maker such as NVIDIA Corporation (TICKER: <A title=""Nvidia Corporation"" href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/nvda"" target=""_blank"">NVDA</A>) or Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (TICKER: <A title=""Advanced Micro Devices, Inc."" href=""http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/amd"" target=""_blank"">AMD</A>) than like West Texas Intermediate oil. If we’re going to treat similar investments as groups, computer processing power makes a better analog for solar modules than oil does.</P><P class=""title""><B>Exhibit 1: Costs of Computer Processing Power, Electricity from Solar PV, and Oil Price per Barrel, 1976-2014<B>[i]</B></B></P><P>In my sole exhibit here, it’s difficult not to notice the similar and similarly dramatic price declines in solar PV in cost per Watt (green line) and computing power in cost per GigaFLOP (blue line) over the last 37 years. Solar-PV-derived power has fallen some 170 times over that period. Computer processing power has declined in cost at many times even solar’s rate, owing to huge demand and massive scaling. Meanwhile, Oil (red line) has done what commodities do: fluctuate in price according to demand and supply factors. Oil gets expensive when economies are growing, when there’s geo-political risk, when some nation or supra-national organization decides it wants it to be expensive, and so on.</P><P>Technology like computer chips and solar panels, in stark contrast, nearly always go down in price as demand goes up. Think about the price declines in computers and televisions over just the last five years, and the simultaneous improvement in the products. But now, the global economy can apply that same tech cost dynamic beyond goods to the energy we need to power those goods and everything else.</P><P>Imagine what that means for world economies. When we grow and use more fossil-commodity based energy, that energy becomes more expensive, and continuing economic growth becomes thwarted. But as we grow with technology-based energies, the increasing power demand <I>decreases</I> the cost of that energy and further stimulates economies! Put another way, consider the simulative effects as we realize the IEA’s estimate of “over USD 115 trillion in fuel savings”[ii] by 2050 as the transition to tech-based renewables, chiefly solar, advances. Solar, although already grid competitive in many areas, is just getting started. The blue line in the exhibit suggests what may yet be possible as solar technology evolves to enjoy the same level of scale and investment as semiconductors. Even with using current solar technology though, $115 trillion is a heck of a liquidity injection.</P><P>Solar will become so inexpensive that it will inevitably continue to gain market share from fossil fuels, starting with those used to generate electricity (coal then natural gas), and then, as the global economy adapts to make better use of renewable electricity in more sectors (think electric cars), it will displace oil. The popular current question ‘when will renewables reach grid parity?’ will seem quaint and even funny in less than a decade. As one report has revealed, “a recent sign of the progress that solar is making in taking over the world: In 42 of the 50 biggest U.S. cities, home to about 21 million single-family homeowners, solar power is now cheaper than electricity from the power grid.”[iii] This is happening because, again, as demand increases, so does scale, investment, R&amp;D advances and declines in installation expense, all of which lead to fast-falling overall costs. Solar PV module costs have declined “75 per cent since the end of 2009 and the cost of electricity from utility-scale solar PV falling 50 per cent since 2010.”[iv] Now, reasonable estimates predict that “Solar Costs Will Fall Another 40% In 2 Years.”[v]
</P><P>Like a pundit in the 1960s or 70s predicting that the computers of 2015 will fill entire rooms and be capable of hundreds of calculations per minute, today’s observers who believe solar is still an expensive niche energy will prove badly mistaken.</P><P>Meanwhile, back in fossil fuel land, costs of production aren’t getting any cheaper, even if barrel and pump prices (temporarily) are. Oil costs a lot to find and go get. Production is expensive to the point that oil companies were cutting their exploration budgets long before the beginning of the oil price decline that began in mid-2014. Unfortunately, a decline in oil prices does nothing to cause a decline in exploration and production costs, meaning oil’s margins get squeezed.</P><P>No one has written more plainly on this than investor Jeremy Grantham: “As a sign of the immediacy of this problem, we have never spent more money developing new oil supplies than we did last year (nearly $700 billion) nor, despite U.S. fracking, found less – replacing in the last 12 months only 4½ months’ worth of current production! Clearly, the writing is on the wall. It is now up to our leadership and to us as individuals to read it and act accordingly.” In a sidebar, Grantham goes on, “The only longer-term price relief and net benefit to the economy will come when either we reverse recent history and start to find more oil more cheaply, which will be like waiting for pigs to fly, or when cheaper sources of energy displace oil.”[vi] As economist Gregor MacDonald recently tweeted: “Sorry, did everyone forget Majors started cutting capex in Q1 of 2014, because $100 not enough to outrun declining ROI on runaway costs?”[vii]
</P><P>In the end, no producer can sell oil for less than it costs to recover it. And those costs are high. Too high to compete in the long run. As Stanford lecturer Tony Seba recently said, “Put these numbers together and you find that solar has improved its cost basis by <I>5,355 times</I> relative to oil since 1970…traditional sources of energy can’t compete with this”[viii] [italics added]. There is a nexus of effects arising from the interplay of tech and commodity energy dynamics, and few if any of them are favorable to fossil fuels.</P><P>Solar PV is a technology, and it’s past and future cost dynamics will behave like technology — becoming ever cheaper. Oil is a commodity, finite and expensive to locate, extract, refine and ship, and oil and other fossil fuels have had and will have cost dynamics to match: very volatile, and always subject to what they cost to extract.</P><P>Today, solar competes mainly with the other means of making electricity: coal, natural gas and nuclear (more on how those stack up in my next post). In the long run, as our economy and infrastructure make more and better use of renewable electricity, oil and solar will compete directly in a way that they do not now. But by then, renewables, led by solar, will be so inexpensive that cost comparisons with oil will no longer spark argument.[ix] For now, suffice it to say that inexpensive oil can’t and won’t prevent the solar boom from continuing, because solar and oil, economically, scarcely share the same world.</P><P><I>Disclosure: At the time this article was published, <A href=""http://greenalphaadvisors.com/"" target=""_blank"">Green Alpha Advisors</A> was long FSLR, and had no positions in NVDA, AMD or Oil.</I></P><P><EM>Other important disclosures <A href=""http://greenalphaadvisors.com/legal-disclaimers/"" target=""_blank"">http://greenalphaadvisors.com/legal-disclaimers/</A></EM></P>

                            Summary on Grant Application Form<SPAN id=""lblAbstract"" style=""font-weight:normal;"">The computational demands of modern computer applications make thepursuit of high performance more critical than ever, and mobile,battery-powered devices, as well as concerns related to <mark>climate</mark>change, require high performance to co-exist with energy-efficiency.Due to physical limits, the traditional means for improving hardwareperformance by increasing processor frequency now carries anunacceptably high energy cost. Advances in processor fabricationtechnology instead allow the construction of many-core processors,where hundreds or thousands of processing elements are placed on asingle chip, promising high performance and energy-efficiency throughsheer volume of processing elements.Many-core devices are present in practically all consumer devices,including smartphones and tablets. As a result, the general public indeveloped countries interact with many-core software daily. Many-coretechnology is also used to accelerate safety-critical software indomains such as medical imaging and autonomous vehicle navigation.It is thus important that many-core software should be reliable. Thisrequires reliable software from programmers, but also a reliable&quot;stack&quot; to support this software, including compilers that allowsoftware to execute on many-core devices, and the many-core devicesthemselves. Recent work on formal verification and testing by myselfand other researchers has identified serious technical problemsspanning the many-core stack. These problems undermine confidence inapplications of many-core technology: defective many-core softwarecould risk fatal accidents in critical domains, and impact negativelyon users in other important application areas.My long-term vision is that the reliability of many-core programmingcan be transformed through breakthroughs in programming languagespecification, formal verification and test case generation, enablingautomated tools to assist programmers and platform vendors inconstructing reliable many-core applications and languageimplementations. The aim of this five-year Fellowship is to undertakefoundational research to investigate a number of open problems whosesolution is key to enabling this long-term vision.First, I seek to investigate whether it is possible to preciselyexpress the intricacies of many-core programming language using formalmathematics, providing a rigorous basis on which software and languageimplementations can be constructed.Second, I aim to tackle several open problems that stand in the way ofeffective formal verification of many-core software, which would allowdevelopers to obtain strong guarantees that such software will operateas required.Third, I will investigate raising this level of rigour beyondmany-core languages. A growing trend is for applications to be writtenin relatively simple, high-level representations, and thenautomatically translated into high-performance many-core code. Thistranslation process must preserve the meaning of programs; I willinvestigate methods for formally certifying that it does.Fourth, I will formulate new methods for testing many-core languageimplementations, exploiting the rigorous language definitions broughtby my approach to enable high test coverage of subtle languagefeatures.Collectively, progress on these problems promises to enable a*high-assurance* many-core stack. I will demonstrate one instance ofsuch a stack for the industry-standard OpenCL language and the PENCILhigh-level language, showing that high-level PENCIL programs can bereliably compiled into rigorously-defined OpenCL, integrated withverified library components, and deployed on thoroughly testedimplementations from many-core vendors.Partnership with four leading many-core technology vendors, AMD, ARM,Imagination Technologies and NVIDIA, provides excellent opportunitiesfor the advances the Fellowship makes to have broad industrial impact.</SPAN>

Since last June, however, the Top500 has been led by a system at a Chinese university specializing in defense technology.</P><P>The U.S. government is determined to change that within the next three years. Last Friday, the Department of Energy (DOE) disclosed <A href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/u-s-to-spend-425-million-on-advanced-supercomputers-1415977202"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">plans to spend $300 million</A> on two new supercomputers that will be “five to seven times more powerful” than systems currently in use.</P><P>The technologies blessed by the contract—supplied by IBM <A class=""component stock-ticker"" data-symbol=""IBM"">(IBM)</A>, Nvidia <A class=""component stock-ticker"" data-symbol=""NVDA"">(NVDA)</A>, and Mellanox <A class=""component stock-ticker"" data-symbol=""MLNX"">(MLNX)</A>—will be installed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

Advanced Micro Devices <A class=""component stock-ticker"" data-symbol=""AMD"">(AMD)</A>, Cray, IBM, Intel <A class=""component stock-ticker"" data-symbol=""INTC"">(INTC)</A>, and Nvidia are all participating in that initiative.

IBM touts the technology’s <A href=""http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/45387.wss"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">“data-centric” approach</A> to processing information. Simply put, more analysis can take place where data is stored, reducing the processing power that has to be dedicated to retrieving it and moving it back and forth between storage hardware and processors.</P><P>When data does need to be moved around, it can be done at speeds of up to 17 petabytes per second—which is the equivalent of moving more than 100 billion digital photos.</P><P>In the traditional supercomputing model, advances in microprocessor speeds can only go so far, said Dave Turek, vice president of exascale computing at IBM. “It used to be all about the calculation, and now it is all about the data,” he said. “We have to put computing in places it never has been before.”</P><P>Aside from scientific applications such as the ones contemplated by the DOE, this unconventional approach could benefit industries highly dependent on high-performance computing technologies for analytics and business intelligence, such as financial services or oil and gas exploration. “Supercomputing design has to change, and it has to change in a way that very explicitly brings these analytics application to the fore. It’s all about accelerating the time to decision,” Turek said.</P><P><I>This item first appeared in the Nov. 17, 2014 edition of Data Sheet, Fortune’s daily newsletter on the business of technology. </I><A href=""http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/?pagename=getdatasheet""><I>Sign up here</I></A><I>.</I></P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""bottom-recirc padded-mobile "" data-tracking-zone=""bottom-recirc""><DIV class=""component feed clearfix bottom-recirc"" data-endpoint=""/element-api/content-proxy/documents"" data-request-data=""%7B%22count%22%3A6%2C%22crops%22%3A%22thumbnail%2Cmarquee_large_2x%2Capp_list_thumbnail_2x%22%2C%22page%22%3A0%2C%22types%22%3A%22post%2Cgallery%22%2C%22recirc%22%3A%22bottom%22%2C%22excluded%22%3A870280%7D"" data-partial=""tile"" data-variation=""bottom-recirc"" data-type=""feed"" data-title=""You May Like"" data-native_ad=""%7B%22dimensions%22%3A%22482x100%22%2C%22placement%22%3A%22footer%22%2C%22priority%22%3A6%7D"" data-nativekey=""wAcSQW5rUVzGCkuf6AZTLmdV""><H3 class=""subtitle"">You May Like</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""article-small-sidebar sidebar-right is-narrow"" data-tracking-zone=""right-rail""><DIV class=""sidebar-item""><DIV class=""component newsletter-callout "" data-newsletter-type=""newsletter-callout""><DIV class=""partial tout""><DIV class=""tout-content-wrapper""><H3>Sign Up for Our Newsletters</H3><DIV class=""tout-content"">Sign up now to receive FORTUNE's best content, special offers, and much more.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Recognizing the pervasive energy constraints of computing, the company announced an ambitious target in 2014 to improve the energy efficiency of its advanced processing units (APUs) 25-fold by 2020. The initiative challenged AMD to develop innovative technologies that could dramatically boost energy efficiency.</SPAN></P><P class=""p2""><SPAN class=""s1""> </SPAN><SPAN class=""s1"">The 25×20 Energy Efficiency Initiative focuses cross-functional engineering resources across multiple entities and levels of AMD on the goal. It requires the development of new processor</SPAN></P><P class=""p1""><SPAN class=""s1"">architectures, power efficient technologies, and power management techniques. The commitment was initially obtained at the executive level including approval from the CEO, and the CTO </SPAN><SPAN class=""s1"">provided priorities</SPAN><SPAN class=""s1"">to the different functions. Coordination is required on software, silicon design,</SPAN><SPAN class=""s1"">architecture, and platform/silicon bring up activities.</SPAN></P><P class=""p2""><SPAN class=""s1"">Having such an ambitious goal rallied the AMD teams. While microprocessor design is very complex, AMD’s executives and engineers drove a focused and diligent effort to develop greater </SPAN><SPAN class=""s1"">energy efficiency into next generation products. The effort was coordinated with teams across AMD including R&amp;D and major business units. Cross-functional project teams identified opportunities for improvement, analyzed their feasibility, and integrated the most promising enhancements into AMD designs. The final designs are subjected to rigorous validation </SPAN><SPAN class=""s1"">tests and additional design revisions before production.</SPAN></P><P class=""p2""><SPAN class=""s1""> </SPAN><SPAN class=""s1"">In 2015, AMD introduced its 6th Generation A-Series APU, codenamed “Carrizo,” which achieved a 2.4-fold improvement in energy efficiency compared to the prior generation, and put the company ahead of pace for achieving the 2020 goal.

            </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""usmf-new article-body""><SPAN class=""article-content""><P>Put simply, cryptocurrencies are doing things Wall Street and investors have never witnessed before. Last year, the aggregate value of all virtual currencies combined soared almost $600 billion to end the year around $613 billion. The aggregate gain of more than 3,300% represents possibly the greatest single-year return for any asset -- and there's a very good chance we won't see anything like it again, at least during our lifetime.</P><P>This surge higher in cryptocurrencies has spawned numerous ways for enthusiasts to make money. Obviously, buying and holding virtual currencies (known as &quot;hodling&quot; among the crypto community) for long periods of time has worked wonders for investors. Bitcoin, which had once traded below $1 per token, surged to around $20,000 per coin in December 2017. Meanwhile, Ethereum and Ripple, which are second and third, respectively, in market cap behind bitcoin, surged by 9,383% and 35,564%, respectively, last year alone.</P><P>Another potentially profitable venture has been buying into publicly traded stocks that <A href=""https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/03/15/3-stocks-with-high-exposure-to-cryptocurrencies.aspx"">have exposure to the cryptocurrency market</A>. For example, the <STRONG>Bitcoin Investment Trust</STRONG> owns a relatively fixed amount of bitcoin in its portfolio, allowing investors a roundabout way of loosely tracking the performance of bitcoin. I say &quot;loosely&quot; because the Bitcoin Investment Trust has often been valued at a 25% to 100% premium over the net value of its held tokens.</P><DIV class=""image""><P class=""caption"">Image source: Getty Images.</P></DIV><H2><STRONG>The allure of cryptocurrency mining</STRONG></H2><P>But perhaps the most intriguing means of making money has been through <A href=""https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/03/14/the-basics-of-cryptocurrency-mining-explained-in-p.aspx"">cryptocurrency mining</A>. Cryptocurrency mining simply describes the process by which persons or businesses with high-powered computers and servers compete against one another to be the first to solve complex mathematical equations associated with a group of transactions (known as a &quot;block&quot;). These complex math equations are derived from the encryption that protects data on a blockchain network from hackers and other undesired parties. Once solved, a block of transactions is considered true -- i.e., no virtual coins were spent twice -- and it's added to the previously resolved blocks, forming a chain. Thus the coined term &quot;blockchain.&quot;</P><P>So, what's in it for cryptocurrency miners to validate these transactions? Being the first to solve a block entitles the miner to a &quot;block reward.&quot; This reward is paid out in the tokens of the cryptocurrency being validated, with the amount of the reward, and difficulty in achieving the reward, varying from one virtual currency to the next. For bitcoin, a block reward entitles the miner to 12.5 tokens, which, with bitcoin valued at around $9,400 per token, works out to a handsome $117,500 haul! Not too shabby. However, bitcoin's rewards halve every 210,000 blocks, meaning the reward for mining bitcoin (and many other digital currencies) declines over time. </P><P>This is also a great time to point out that <A href=""https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/03/26/the-basics-of-mined-vs-non-mined-cryptocurrency-ex.aspx"">not all cryptocurrencies are mineable</A>. While bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin are mined, Ripple, EOS, Cardano, and Stellar are not. Validation of transactions is done in a different way for non-mined cryptocurrencies, which means new tokens aren't created or rewarded.</P><H2><STRONG>Three costs cryptocurrency miners must know about</STRONG></H2><P>Sitting back and relaxing while computers and servers do all the work might sound like a grand scheme to make money, but I assure you there are also some very grandiose expenses involved as well. Cryptocurrency miners need to be aware of three very prominent costs.</P><DIV class=""image""><P class=""caption"">Image source: Getty Images.</P></DIV><H2><STRONG>1. Electricity costs</STRONG></H2><P>One of the more sizable costs miners will contend with is the electricity expense needed to run graphics processing units (GPUs) or specialized ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) chips, along with servers and computers. The proof-of-work model, as cryptocurrency mining is also known, is very electricity-intensive, meaning lower kilowatt-per-hour (kWh) prices are favorable to the margins of miners.</P><P>What countries offer the lowest kWh costs? In a stroke of irony, some of the most attractive places to mine also happen to have stringent rules on cryptocurrencies. China, for example, has some of the lowest kWh costs in the world. However, China has also banned initial coin offerings and domestic cryptocurrency exchanges, and it has throttled back electricity usage for some of the country's largest mining companies.</P><P>Recently, mining companies like <STRONG>HIVE Blockchain Technologies</STRONG><SPAN class=""ticker"" data-id=""339765"">(<A href=""https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaqoth/hive-blockchain-technologies-ltd/hvbtf"">NASDAQOTH:HVBTF</A>)</SPAN> have been turning to the Nordic region for cheaper electricity costs. HIVE is setting up mining centers in Sweden and Iceland, both of which have below-average electricity costs relative to the European average. What's more, Nordic countries like Sweden are <A href=""https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/04/20/this-could-be-a-surprising-renewable-energy-cataly.aspx"">more heavily reliant on renewable energy</A>, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, to generate electricity, which helps keeps total kWh costs down. </P><P>In short, location matters!</P><DIV class=""image""><P class=""caption"">Image source: Getty Images.</P></DIV><H2><STRONG>2. Cooling costs</STRONG></H2><P>Secondly, cryptocurrency miners have to understand that operating a few dozen or more GPUs, along with servers and computers, can produce a lot of heat. This heat can create a non-optimal operating temperature for the mining hardware, leading to its failure if not properly dealt with. This means cooling systems may need to be in place to keep mining hardware from overheating and breaking. This is another electricity cost some folks might overlook.</P><P>It is worth noting that location can, once again, play a role in how much of an impact cooling costs have on mining margins. Operating in Iceland's <A href=""https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/03/09/surprise-this-cryptocurrency-mining-stock-is-profi.aspx"">naturally cooler temperatures</A> may help HIVE Blockchain Technologies keep its cooling costs down. In fact, HIVE specifically lists &quot;cold <mark>climate</mark>&quot; as one of the three main selling points of putting a mining data center in Iceland (along with fast internet connection and low-cost green power). </P><DIV class=""image""><P class=""caption"">Image source: Getty Images.</P></DIV><H2><STRONG>3. Hardware costs</STRONG></H2><P>Lastly, cryptocurrency miners have to contend with hardware costs, which can actually turn out to be their biggest budgetary eyesore of all.</P><P>Miners can be hit with hardware costs in two specific ways. First, there are the start-up costs of initially buying the hardware needed to mine cryptocurrencies. And second, miners get hit with the need to constantly upgrade their equipment in order to remain competitive against other mining farms.</P><P>Over the past year, <STRONG>NVIDIA</STRONG><SPAN class=""ticker"" data-id=""204770"">(<A href=""https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/nvidia/nvda"">NASDAQ:NVDA</A>)</SPAN> and <STRONG>Advanced Micro Devices</STRONG><SPAN class=""ticker"" data-id=""202799"">(<A href=""https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/advanced-micro-devices/amd"">NASDAQ:AMD</A>)</SPAN> have watched as cryptocurrency miners have gobbled up graphics cards for GPUs at an incredible pace, dramatically cutting supply and causing the price for graphics cards to skyrocket by 100% to 200%. While initially great news for NVIDIA and Advanced Micro, it's sort of left these two giants <A href=""https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/04/10/3-pervasive-cryptocurrency-conundrums.aspx"">in a bind</A>. NVIDIA and Advanced Micro could choose to manufacture specific graphics cards for crypto miners, hurting their sudden surge in sales, or they could do nothing and risk alienating their core gaming customer who's irritated by suddenly high graphics card prices. It's really a no-win situation for either company, and it's been a major source of expenditures for crypto miners. </P><DIV class=""image""><P class=""caption"">Image source: Getty Images.</P></DIV><H2><STRONG>Now for that aforementioned wildcard...</STRONG></H2><P>There's also a wildcard among all of this that could make or break cryptocurrency miners: the underlying movement in virtual currencies.</P><P>As you've probably correctly guessed, falling cryptocurrency prices aren't good news for mining margins. The higher coin prices go, the more lucrative it often is to mine virtual tokens. Understand, though, that as it becomes more profitable to mine, the competition to resolve a block becomes fiercer, which can ultimately be a drag on margins.</P><P>Similarly, cryptocurrency miner margins will depend on what they do with the tokens they receive as a reward. Miners could choose to convert them into a fiat currency almost immediately, thusly locking in predictable margins at that time. However, they could also choose to hang onto their coins indefinitely and become investors. If the price of the virtual coins being held dramatically appreciates, miners will have added icing to their cakes. But if crypto prices fall, it could slash margins -- or perhaps even make it unprofitable to have mined tokens in the first place.</P><P>For the time being, the cryptocurrency mining industry is thriving. But will it remain so even three years from now? I'm not so certain.</P></SPAN><SPAN class=""article-disclosure""><P><EM><A href=""http://my.fool.com/profile/TMFUltraLong/info.aspx"">Sean Williams</A> has no position in any of the stocks or cryptocurrencies mentioned.

The computer, built by Cray, is operated in Tennessee as part of the Department of Energy's network of research labs. Researchers from academia, government labs, and various industries will be able to use Titan to research things such as <mark>climate change</mark> and alternative fuels.</P><P>

The machine is one of the new types of systems that combine discrete graphics chips, or GPUs, commonly used for video games, along with standard microprocessors. In this case, Nvidia is providing the GPUs while the CPUs come from AMD. Graphics chips are used to accelerate the number-crunching functions of supercomputers by allowing many tasks to be completed at once, and they require less power than CPUs alone.</P><P>

Many other machines on the Top500's list, published twice a year, also use GPUs. As the group noted, 62 systems on the list are using accelerator/co-processor technology. Six months ago, 58 systems used such technology. </P><P>

While the top machine on the list uses AMD processors, Intel continues to provide the chips for most Top500 systems, a whopping 76 percent of them, to be precise. Its new <A href=""http://www.zdnet.com/intel-renames-mic-chip-in-supercomputer-push-3040155407/"" target=""_blank"" data-component=""externalLink"">many integrated core, or MIC, architecture</A>, is used in several machines, including Stampede, a Dell system installed at the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas in Austin. That supercomputer made the top 10.  </P><P>

Rounding out the top five systems are Fujitsu's K computer installed at the RIKEN Advanced Institute for Computational Science in Kobe, Japan; an IBM Blue Gene/Q system named Mira at Argonne National Laboratory; and an IBM BlueGene/Q system named Juqueen at the Forschungszentrum Juelich in Germany. </P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

But as big as they are today, supercomputers aren't big enough -- and a key topic for some of the estimated 11,000 people now gathering in Portland, Ore. for the 22nd annual supercomputing conference, SC09, will be the next performance goal: an exascale system.</P><P>Today, supercomputers <A href=""http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/print/324410/Supercomputer_race_It_s_a_tricky_task_to_boost_and_measure_system_speed?taxonomyName=Hardware&amp;taxonomyId=12"">are well short of an exascale</A>. The world's fastest system at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, according to the just released Top500 list, is a Cray XT5 system, which has 224,256 processing cores from six-core Opteron chips made by Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD). The Jaguar is capable of a peak performance of 2.3 petaflops.</P><ASIDE id=""fsb-2055"" class=""fakesidebar fakesidebar-auto""><STRONG>[ To comment on this story, visit <A href=""https://www.facebook.com/Computerworld/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Computerworld's Facebook page</A>. ]</STRONG></ASIDE><P>But Jaguar's record is just a blip, a fleeting benchmark. The U.S. Department of Energy has already begun holding workshops on building a system that's 1,000 times more powerful -- an exascale system, said Buddy Bland, project director at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility that includes Jaguar. The exascale systems will be needed for high-resolution <mark>climate</mark> models, bio energy products and smart grid development as well as fusion energy design. The later project is now under way in France: the <A href=""http://www.iter.org/default.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor</A>, which the U.S. is co-developing.</P><P>&quot;There are serious exascale-class problems that just cannot be solved in any reasonable amount of time with the computers that we have today,&quot; said Bland.</P><P>As amazing as supercomputing systems are, they remain primitive and current designs soak up too much power, space and money. It wasn't until 1997 that the first teraflop system, ASCI Red at Sandia National Lab, broke the teraflop barrier, reaching one trillion calculations per second. In 2008 IBM's Roadrunner at the Los Alamos National Laboratory <A href=""http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9095318/IBM_s_Roadrunner_smashes_4_minute_mile_of_supercomputing?taxonomyId=12&amp;intsrc=kc_top&amp;taxonomyName=hardware"">achieved petaflop speed</A>, or one thousand trillion (one quadrillion) sustained floating-point operations per second.</P><P>The Energy Department, which is responsible for funding many of the world's largest systems, wants two machines somewhere in the 2011-13 timeframe that will reach approximately 10 petaflops, said Bland.</P><ASIDE id=""fsb-2600"" class=""fakesidebar fakesidebar-auto fakesidebar-sponsored""><STRONG>[ <A href=""https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/321564/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fpaths%2Fapple-certified-technical-trainer-10-11"" rel=""nofollow"">Get certified as an Apple Technical Coordinator with this seven-part online course from PluralSight.</A> ] </STRONG></ASIDE><P>But the next milestone now getting attention from planners is something that can reach an exaflop, or a million trillion calculations per second, (one quintillion). That's 1,000 times faster than a petaflop.</P><P>The exaflop will likely arrive around 2018. The <A href=""http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9095279/All_hail_Roadrunner_s_petaflop_record_now_what_about_the_exaflop_?taxonomyId=12&amp;intsrc=hm_topic"">big performance leaps are expected </A> to happen every decade or so. Moore's Law, which says the number of transistors on a chip will double every 18 months or so, helps to explain the roughly 10-year development period. But the problems involved in reaching exaflop scale go well beyond Moore's Law.</P><P>The Jaguar uses 7 megawatts of power or 7 million watts. An exascale system that used CPU processing cores alone might take 2 gigawatts or two billion watts, says Dave Turek, IBM vice president of deep computing. &quot;That's roughly the size of medium-sized nuclear power plant. That's an untenable proposition for the future,&quot; he said.</P><P>IBM is in competition with Cray and other supercomputing makers, and finding a way to cut power demands for users is among the top problems. But the vendors still have to decide how to build these systems. Increasingly, they're likely to use hybrid approaches that combine co-processors or accelerators with CPUs in an effort to cut power.</P><P>The Roadrunner, which uses 3.9 megawatts, achieved just over one petaflop when it was announced. It uses a hybrid architecture that mixes AMD processors with Cell processors that include nine separate processor cores, including one PowerPC core and eight smaller co-processing units called synergistic processing elements. The use of co-processors, which includes graphics processing units, and field-programmable gate arrays, are intended to help cut power demand by moving some of the work off CPUs to processors that handle more specialized work. </P><P>Estimates on the size of exascale systems range from 10 million to 100 million cores. Turek believes the latter number is more likely.</P><P>&quot;We think exascale is a 100 million-core kind of enterprise, and there doesn't seem any real pathway around it, said Turek. &quot;Where the players in pursuit of exascale are today is [at] a state of investigation to see what the right model is. So if hybridization is the key, then what is the ratio of special-purpose cores to conventional cores?&quot; he said.</P><P>These future systems will have to use less memory per core and will need more memory bandwidth. Systems running 100 million cores will continually see core failures and the tools for dealing with them will have to be rethought &quot;in a dramatic kind of way,&quot; said Turek.</P><P>IBM's design goal for an exascale system is to limit it to 20 megawatts of power and keep it at a size of between 70 and 80 racks.
Jaguar is entirely built of CPUs, but Bland also sees future systems as hybrids, and points to chip development by both Intel and AMD that combine CPUs and co-processors. </P><P>&quot;We believe that using accelerators is going to be absolutely critical to any strategy to getting to exaflop computers,&quot; he said.</P><P>Addison Snell, CEO of InterSect360 Research, an HPC research firm in Sunnyvale, Calif., said accelerators are capable of providing vast computational capability for specific applications, and the applications that can take advantage of them can move toward exascale first.&quot; Eventually, a general-purpose exascale system will arrive, &quot;but special-purpose will probably come first.&quot;</P><P>Before exascale arrives, petaflop systems will continue to grow in size, and government-funded efforts to build massive systems seems to be on the rise. Fujitsu is planning a 10-petaflop computer in 2011 for Japan's Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, and China has now reached petaflop scale. Governments appear to be more willing to fund large systems, and an international race may be starting to build systems capable of solving some of the world's most pressing problems. </P></DIV><DIV class=""apart-alt tags""><SPAN class=""related"">Related: </SPAN></DIV></SECTION></ARTICLE></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The goal of the new broad-based environmental effort is to save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by setting aggressive new targets for energy-efficient computers and components, and promoting the adoption of energy-efficient computers and power management tools worldwide.</P><P>&quot;Today, the average desktop PC wastes nearly half of its power, and the average server wastes one-third of its power,&quot; said Urs Holzle, senior vice president, Operations, Google Inc. &quot;The <mark>Climate</mark> Savers Computing Initiative is setting a new 90 percent efficiency target for power supplies, which if achieved, will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 54 million tons per year -- and save more than $5.5 billion in energy costs.</P><P>&quot;We are asking businesses and individuals throughout the world to join with us to institute better power management of their computing equipment and purchase energy-efficient computers,&quot; Holzle added.</P><P>Initial companies who intend to participate in the initiative represent both the demand and supply side of the computer industry, including computer manufacturers and chip makers, as well as environmental groups, energy companies, retailers, government agencies and more. The group will formalize its membership in coming weeks.</P><P>&quot;By 2010, the <mark>Climate</mark> Savers Computing Initiative will cut greenhouse gas emissions in an amount equal to removing more than 11 million cars from the road or shutting down 20 500-megawatt coal-fired power plants -- a significant step in reducing the emissions affecting our planet,&quot; said Pat Gelsinger, senior vice president and general manager of Intel's Digital Enterprise Group.</P><P>&quot;Computers have helped us make huge strides toward a more efficient world today, with reduced travel, more productivity, online transactions and more,&quot; Gelsinger added. &quot;But with today's latest energy-efficient technologies, we can do even more. The commitment of the member companies that are here with us today is a firm statement to the collective resolve to make an enormous impact.&quot;</P><P>Computer and computer component manufacturers who support the initiative are committed to building energy-efficient products that meet or surpass the EPA's Energy Star® guidelines.

For example, 2007 Energy Star specifications require that PC power supplies meet at least 80 percent minimum efficiency. The initiative would require a minimum of 90 percent by 2010. In addition, the initiative sets a higher efficiency target in the power supply for volume servers (1U and 2U single-socket and dual-socket systems): an increase from 85 percent to 92 percent efficiency by 2010.

(NASDAQ:AMD) stock was on track for a second day in the red on Friday as the bullish sentiment from the chip maker’s <A href=""https://www.valuewalk.com/2018/01/amd-earnings-beat-estimates-stock/"">Q4 2017</A> earnings report continued to wear off. Despite the early decline, AMD stock is still up from where it was before the earnings release, although the gains are in danger of being erased completely.</P><H3>AMD Q4 2017 earnings beat not so attractive</H3><P>In a post-earnings note, Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis argued that after factoring in all the “moving parts, AMD’s earnings beat becomes “far less attractive.” He explained that the accounting change provided a $100 million boost to AMD’s Semi-Custom segment alone.</P><P>He also disagrees with management’s assessment of AMD’s earnings beat, noting that they mentioned” incremental growth” across product lines, including GPUs, and the Ryzen and EPYC product lines. Instead, he believes that most of the earnings beat came from GPUs, and most analysts agree that much of the incremental growth is coming from cryptocurrency-related demand. In fact, he doesn’t think AMD management is being entirely clear on where AMD’s earnings beat in Q4 came from.</P><H3>Was AMD management being totally clear?</H3><P>Although they estimated that about one-third of the incremental growth in the Computing and Graphics segment was probably from cryptocurrency-related demand, Curtis believes that it was probably more than that. He also noted that it’s difficult to track this because the same cards are used for both gaming and <A href=""https://www.valuewalk.com/2018/01/amd-nvidia-stock-ethereum-mining/"">cryptocurrency mining</A>.</P><P>Overall, he called the Q4 2017 results “decent,” but he still believes that the main drivers of AMD’s earnings beat face challenges into this year. He has “seen little evidence of share gains outside of crypto,” as he said that desktop CPUs are “barely up” year over year. Further, he believes the chip maker’s EPYC product line is “unsuccessful despite a goal of mid-single-digit-unit share” by the end of this year.</P><P>He feels that the new accounting standards also gave AMD’s Q1 2018 guidance a boost, as the chip maker guided for sales to be $1.55 billion, plus or minus $50 million, which is beat the consensus of $1.25 billion handling. He maintains his <EM>Underweight</EM> rating and $10 price target on AMD stock following the company’s earnings beat.</P><H3>AMD stock could be kept range-bound</H3><P>Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer maintained his <EM>Neutral</EM> rating but raised his target price on AMD stock from $12 to $13.50 per share following the earnings beat. Unlike Curtis and much of the rest of the sell side, he sees <A href=""https://www.valuewalk.com/2018/01/samsungs-cryptocurrency-mining/"">crypto-related demand</A> as being “more <mark>sustainable</mark> with most. In fact, between crypto demand and the value of the chip maker’s core intellectual property, he feels the valuation of AMD stock could remain range-bound between $13 and $15 per share.</P><P>Like Curtis, Macquarie analyst Srini Pajjuri questions the sustainability of crypto demand, but like Pitzer, he raised his price target for AMD stock, moving it up to $13 from $11 per share. The big thing he wants the company to work on is its margins, and he feels that the numbers suggest any share gains AMD has managed are coming from the low end of the PC and server markets. He sees servers as a key part of getting AMD stock “to work,” although he did find the company’s progress in PCs to be “encouraging.”</P><P>AMD stock continued to slide on Friday, falling by about 4% to as low as $9.70 before bouncing.</P><ASIDE class=""mashsb-container mashsb-main mashsb-stretched""><DIV class=""mashsb-box""><DIV class=""mashsb-buttons""><A class=""mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.valuewalk.com%2F2018%2F02%2Fadvanced-micro-devices-inc-stock-still-sliding-earnings-beat%2F"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><SPAN class=""text"">Facebook</SPAN></A><A class=""mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow"" href=""https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Advanced%20Micro%20Devices%2C%20Inc.%20Stock%20Still%20Sliding%20After%20Earnings%20Beat&amp;url=https://www.valuewalk.com/2018/02/advanced-micro-devices-inc-stock-still-sliding-earnings-beat/&amp;via=valuewalk"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><SPAN class=""text"">Twitter</SPAN></A><A class=""mashicon-reddit mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow"" href=""http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.valuewalk.com%2F2018%2F02%2Fadvanced-micro-devices-inc-stock-still-sliding-earnings-beat%2F&amp;title=Advanced+Micro+Devices%2C+Inc.+Stock+Still+Sliding+After+Earnings+Beat"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><SPAN class=""text"">Reddit</SPAN></A></DIV></DIV></ASIDE></DIV><FOOTER class=""entry-footer""><DIV class=""post_author vcard""><DIV class=""author-description""><SPAN>Author:  <A class=""url fn n"" href=""https://www.valuewalk.com/author/michelle-jones/"">Michelle Jones</A></SPAN>Michelle Jones was a television news producer for eight years.

The measure is included to offset the previous emphasis on gross margin and sales growth, measures that ignored the investments required today to generate growth for tomorrow. In contrast, the shareholder value metric quantifies the impact of proposed investments for business creation and development. The majority of Apple’s business is organized on a functional basis—sales, product design, and worldwide manufacturing and operations—so shareholder value can be calculated only for the entire company instead of at a decentralized level. The measure, however, helps senior managers in each major organizational unit assess the impact of their activities on the entire company’s valuation and evaluate new business ventures. 
 </P><P>While these five performance indicators have only recently been developed, they have helped Apple’s senior managers focus their strategy in a number of ways. First of all, the balanced scorecard at Apple serves primarily as a planning device, instead of as a control device. To put it another way, Apple uses the measures to adjust the “long wave” of corporate performance, not to drive operating changes. Moreover, the metrics at Apple, with the exception of shareholder value, can be driven both horizontally and vertically into each functional organization. Considered vertically, each individual measure can be broken down into its component parts in order to evaluate how each part contributes to the functioning of the whole. Thought of horizontally, the measures can identify how, for example, design and manufacturing contribute to an area such as customer satisfaction. In addition, Apple has found that its balanced scorecard has helped develop a language of measurable outputs for how to launch and leverage programs.</P><DIV class=""article-callout""><DIV class=""callout-contents""><P>Apple uses the scorecard as a device to plan long-term performance, not as a device to drive operating changes.</P></DIV></DIV><P>The five performance indicators at Apple are benchmarked against best-in-class organizations. Today they are used to build business plans and are incorporated into senior executives’ compensation plans.</P><H2>Advanced Micro Devices: Consolidating Strategic Information</H2><P>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a semiconductor company, executed a quick and easy transition to a balanced scorecard. It already had a clearly defined mission, strategy statement, and shared understanding among senior executives about its competitive niche. It also had many performance measures from many different sources and information systems. The balanced scorecard consolidated and focused these diverse measures into a quarterly briefing book that contained seven sections: financial measures; customer-based measures, such as on-time delivery, lead time, and performance-to-schedule; measures of critical business processes in wafer fabrication, assembly and test, new product development, process technology development (e.g., submicron etching precision), and, finally, measures for corporate quality. In addition, organizational learning was measured by imposing targeted rates of improvements for key operating parameters, such as cycle time and yields by process.</P><P>At present, AMD sees its scorecard as a systematic repository for strategic information that facilitates long-term trend analysis for planning and performance evaluation.</P><H2>Driving the Process of Change</H2><P>The experiences of these companies and others reveal that the balanced scorecard is most successful when it is used to drive the process of change. Rockwater, for instance, came into existence after the merger of two different organizations. Employees came from different cultures, spoke different languages, and had different operating experiences and backgrounds. The balanced scorecard helped the company focus on what it had to do well in order to become the industry leader.</P><P>Similarly, Joseph De Feo, chief executive of Service Businesses, one of the three operating divisions of Barclays Bank, had to transform what had been a captive, internal supplier of services into a global competitor. The scorecard highlighted areas where, despite apparent consensus on strategy, there still was considerable disagreement about how to make the strategy operational. With the help of the scorecard, the division eventually achieved consensus concerning the highest priority areas for achievement and improvement and identified additional areas that needed attention, such as quality and productivity. De Feo assessed the impact of the scorecard, saying, “It helped us to drive major change, to become more market oriented, throughout our organization. It provided a shared understanding of our goals and what it took to achieve them.”</P><P>Analog Devices, a semiconductor company, served as the prototype for the balanced scorecard and now uses it each year to update the targets and goals for division managers. Jerry Fishman, president of Analog, said, “At the beginning, the scorecard drove significant and considerable change. It still does when we focus attention on particular areas, such as the gross margins on new products. But its main impact today is to help sustain programs that our people have been working on for years.” Recently, the company has been attempting to integrate the scorecard metrics with <EM>hoshin</EM> planning, a procedure that concentrates an entire company on achieving one or two key objectives each year. Analog’s hoshin objectives have included customer service and new product development, for which measures already exist on the company’s scorecard.</P><P>But the scorecard isn’t always the impetus for such dramatic change. For example, AMD’s scorecard has yet to have a significant impact because company management didn’t use it to drive the change process. Before turning to the scorecard, senior managers had already formulated and gained consensus for the company’s mission, strategy, and key performance measures. AMD competes in a single industry segment. The top 12 managers are intimately familiar with the markets, engineering, technology, and other key levers in this segment. The summary and aggregate information in the scorecard were neither new nor surprising to them. And managers of decentralized production units also already had a significant amount of information about their own operations. The scorecard did enable them to see the breadth and totality of company operations, enhancing their ability to become better managers for the entire company. But, on balance, the scorecard could only encapsulate knowledge that managers in general had already learned. 
 </P><DIV class=""article-callout""><DIV class=""callout-contents""><P>The scorecard enables managers to see the breadth and totality of company operations. </P><P>At Advanced Micro Devices, the scorecard only encapsulated knowledge that managers had already learned.</P></DIV></DIV><P>AMD’s limited success with the balanced scorecard demonstrates that the scorecard has its greatest impact when used to drive a change process. Some companies link compensation of senior executives to achieving stretch targets for the scorecard measures. Most are attempting to translate the scorecard into operational measures that become the focus for improvement activities in local units. The scorecard is not just a measurement system; it is a management system to motivate breakthrough competitive performance.</P><ARTICLE-SIDEBAR class=""article-sidebar sidebar--half"" data-sidebar-alternate=""sidebar""><H4 class=""sidebar-title"">The Scorecard’s Impact on External Reporting </H4><DIV class=""sidebar-contents height--collapse""><P>Several managers have asked whether or not the balanced scorecard is applicable to external reporting. If the scorecard is indeed a driver of long-term performance, shouldn’t this information be relevant to the investment community? </P><P>In fact, the scorecard does not translate easily to the investment community. A scorecard makes sense primarily for business units and divisions with a well-defined strategy. Most companies have several divisions, each with its own mission and strategy, whose scorecards cannot be aggregated into an overall corporate scorecard. And if the scorecard does indeed provide a transparent vision into a unit’s strategy, then the information, even the measures being used, might be highly sensitive data that could reveal much of value to competitors. But most important, as a relatively recent <mark>innovation</mark>, the scorecard would benefit from several years of experimentation within companies before it becomes a systematic part of reporting to external constituencies. </P><P>Even if the scorecard itself were better suited to external reporting, at present the financial community itself shows little interest in making the change from financial to strategic reporting. One company president has found the outside financial community leery of the principles that ground the scorecard: “We use the scorecard more with our customers than with our investors. The financial community is skeptical about long-term indicators and occasionally tells us about some empirical evidence of a negative correlation between stock prices and attention to total quality and internal processes.” </P><P>However, the investment community has begun to focus on some key metrics of new product performance. Could this be an early sign of a shift to strategic thinking?</P></DIV></ARTICLE-SIDEBAR><H2>Implementing the Balanced Scorecard at FMC Corporation: An Interview with Larry D. Brady</H2><P><EM>FMC Corporation is one of the most diversified companies in the United States, producing more than 300 product lines in 21 divisions organized into 5 business segments: industrial chemicals, performance chemicals, precious metals, defense systems, and machinery and equipment. Based in Chicago, FMC has worldwide revenues in excess of $4 billion.</EM></P><P><EM>Since 1984, the company has realized annual returns-on-investment of greater than 15%. Coupled with a major recapitalization in 1986, these returns resulted in an increasing shareholder value that significantly exceeded industrial averages. In 1992, the company completed a strategic review to determine the best future course to maximize shareholder value. As a result of that review, FMC adopted a growth strategy to complement its strong operating performance. This strategy required a greater external focus and appreciation of operating trade-offs.</EM></P><P><EM>To help make the shift, the company decided to use the balanced scorecard. In this interview conducted by Robert S. Kaplan, Larry D. Brady, executive vice president of FMC, talks about the company’s experience implementing the scorecard.</EM></P><P><STRONG>Robert S. Kaplan:</STRONG><EM> What’s the status of the balanced scorecard at FMC?</EM></P><P><STRONG>Larry D. Brady: </STRONG>Although we are just completing the pilot phase of implementation, I think that the balanced scorecard is likely to become the cornerstone of the management system at FMC. It enables us to translate business unit strategies into a measurement system that meshes with our entire system of management.</P><P>For instance, one manager reported that while his division had measured many operating variables in the past, now, because of the scorecard, it had chosen 12 parameters as the key to its strategy implementation. Seven of these strategic variables were entirely new measurements for the division. The manager interpreted this finding as verifying what many other managers were reporting: the scorecard improved the understanding and consistency of strategy implementation. Another manager reported that, unlike monthly financial statements or even his strategic plan, if a rival were to see his scorecard, he would lose his competitive edge.</P><P><EM>It’s rare to get that much enthusiasm among divisional managers for a corporate initiative. What led you and them to the balanced scorecard?</EM></P><P>FMC had a clearly defined mission: to become our customers’ most valued supplier. We had initiated many of the popular improvement programs: total quality, managing by objectives, organizational effectiveness, building a high-performance organization. But these efforts had not been effective. Every time we promoted a new program, people in each division would sit back and ask, “How is that supposed to fit in with the six other things we’re supposed to be doing?’’</P><P>Corporate staff groups were perceived by operating managers as pushing their pet programs on divisions. The diversity of initiatives, each with its own slogan, created confusion and mixed signals about where to concentrate and how the various programs interrelated. At the end of the day, with all these new initiatives, we were still asking division managers to deliver consistent short-term financial performance.</P><DIV class=""article-callout""><DIV class=""callout-contents""><P>“The diversity of initiatives, each with its own slogan, created confusion and mixed signals.”</P></DIV></DIV><P><EM>What kinds of measures were you using?</EM></P><P>The FMC corporate executive team, like most corporate offices, reviews the financial performance of each operating division monthly. As a highly diversified company that redeploys assets from mature cash generators to divisions with significant growth opportunities, the return-on-capital-employed (ROCE) measure was especially important for us. We were one of the few companies to inflation-adjust our internal financial measures so that we could get a more accurate picture of a division’s economic profitability.</P><P>At year-end, we rewarded division managers who delivered predictable financial performance. We had run the company tightly for the past 20 years and had been successful. But it was becoming less clear where future growth would come from and where the company should look for breakthroughs into new areas. We had become a high return-on-investment company but had less potential for further growth. It was also not at all clear from our financial reports what progress we were making in implementing long-term initiatives. Questions from the corporate office about spending versus budget also reinforced a focus on the short-term and on internal operations.</P><P>But the problem went even deeper than that. Think about it. What is the value added of a corporate office that concentrates on making division managers accountable for financial results that can be added up across divisions? We combine a business that’s doing well with a business that’s doing poorly and have a total business that performs at an average level. Why not split the company up into independent companies and let the market reallocate capital? If we were going to create value by managing a group of diversified companies, we had to understand and provide strategic focus to their operations. We had to be sure that each division had a strategy that would give it <mark>sustainable</mark> competitive advantage. In addition, we had to be able to assess, through measurement of their operations, whether or not the divisions were meeting their strategic objectives.</P><P>If you’re going to ask a division or the corporation to change its strategy, you had better change the system of measurement to be consistent with the new strategy.</P><DIV class=""article-callout""><DIV class=""callout-contents""><P>“If you’re going to ask a division or the corporation to change its strategy, you had better change the system of measurement.”</P></DIV></DIV><P><EM>How did the balanced scorecard emerge as the remedy to the limitations of measuring only short-term financial results?</EM></P><P>In early 1992, we assembled a task force to integrate our various corporate initiatives. We wanted to understand what had to be done differently to achieve dramatic improvements in overall organizational effectiveness. We acknowledged that the company may have become too short-term and too internally focused in its business measures. Defining what should replace the financial focus was more difficult. We wanted managers to sustain their search for continuous improvement, but we also wanted them to identify the opportunities for breakthrough performance.</P><P>When divisions missed financial targets, the reasons were generally not internal. Typically, division management had inaccurately estimated market demands or had failed to forecast competitive reactions. A new measurement system was needed to lead operating managers beyond achieving internal goals to searching for competitive breakthroughs in the global marketplace. The system would have to focus on measures of customer service, market position, and new products that could generate long-term value for the business. We used the scorecard as the focal point for the discussion. It forced division managers to answer these questions: How do we become our customers’ most valued supplier? How do we become more externally focused? What is my division’s competitive advantage? What is its competitive vulnerability?</P><P><EM>How did you launch the scorecard effort at FMC?</EM></P><P>We decided to try a pilot program. We selected six division managers to develop prototype scorecards for their operations. Each division had to perform a strategic analysis to identify its sources of competitive advantage. The 15 to 20 measures in the balanced scorecard had to be organization-specific and had to communicate clearly what short-term measures of operating performance were consistent with a long-term trajectory of strategic success.</P><P><EM>Were the six division managers free to develop their own scorecard?</EM></P><P>We definitely wanted the division managers to perform their own strategic analysis and to develop their own measures. That was an essential part of creating a consensus between senior and divisional management on operating objectives. Senior management did, however, place some conditions on the outcomes.</P><P>First of all, we wanted the measures to be objective and quantifiable. Division managers were to be just as accountable for improving scorecard measures as they had been for using monthly financial reviews. Second, we wanted output measures not process-oriented measures. Many of the improvement programs under way were emphasizing time, quality, and cost measurements. Focusing on T-Q-C measurements, however, encourages managers to seek narrow process improvements instead of breakthrough output targets. Focusing on achieving outputs forces division managers to understand their industry and strategy and help them to quantify strategic success through specific output targets.</P><P><EM>Could you illustrate the distinction between process measures and output measures?</EM></P><P>You have to understand your industry well to develop the connection between process improvements and outputs achieved. Take three divisional examples of cycle-time measurement, a common process measure.</P><P>For much of our defense business, no premium is earned for early delivery. And the contracts allow for reimbursement of inventory holding costs. Therefore, attempts to reduce inventory or cycle times in this business produce no benefit for which the customer is willing to pay. The only benefits from cycle time or inventory reduction occur when reduction in factory-floor complexity leads to real reductions in product cost. The output performance targets must be real cash savings, not reduced inventory levels or cycle times.</P><ARTICLE-PROMO class=""article-promo promo--half""><H4>By the Same Authors</H4></ARTICLE-PROMO></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE-CONTENT></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Air <mark>pollution</mark> is one of many sustainability factors that companies report on. But is it the most important?
Photograph: Joe Klamar/AFP/Getty Images
</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></HEADER><DIV class=""content__article-body from-content-api js-article__body"" itemprop=""articleBody"" data-test-id=""article-review-body""><P>Early in my career I had an epiphany. It was the mid-80s and I was working for the US Environmental Protection Agency, developing risk assessments for regulating toxic air <mark>pollution</mark>. I was asked to work on a new law: the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (Sara), which – in section 313 – required that companies report on releases of toxic chemicals from their factories. My initial impression was that this was a ridiculous requirement. I could not envision how lumping a bunch of very different chemicals together and simply reporting their combined releases could tell you anything useful. </P><P>Wow, was I wrong ...</P><P>Sara 313 was arguably one of the most effective laws in the history of toxic substance control, and a big part of its success lay in its radical (at that time) transparency requirement. When the law was implemented, the press had a field day. Every year, as companies reported their toxic emissions, stories came out with titles like “The Dirty Dozen” or “Top Ten Toxic Polluters.” All of this negative publicity got attention and, in short-order, companies started to reduce their toxic emissions. </P><P>The key lesson was that transparency can be a powerful force for good. </P><P>Today, transparency – or disclosure of corporate sustainability information – is common practice across a variety of industries. As of this writing, <A href=""http://www.corporateregister.com/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">CorporateRegister.com</A> lists over 60,000 sustainability reports covering nearly every aspect of corporate behavior. But while Sara 313 clarified the cause-and-effect relationship between reporting and emission reductions, today’s proliferation of sustainability reports begs the question: is corporate sustainability reporting in its current format truly driving results?</P><P>The main problem with today’s version of transparency is its breadth. We measure almost everything that can be measured. Not only is it impractical for companies to manage this large scope of issues, but reporting on a dizzying array of topics can obscure important issues by overemphasizing the merely interesting. This is not to say that transparency reporting is wrong, or to discount the gains that have occurred because of it. The issue, rather, is whether we are reaping enough of a return on our investment in corporate sustainability reporting. </P><P>Sara 313 was effective for three basic reasons: it was easy to understand, it focused on an important issue, and it generated easy-to-compare corporate results. The last point – comparability – was especially vital, as it greatly accelerated the power of transparency to improve performance. Each year, when the Sara 313 data was released, companies were ranked by the amount of toxic materials that they emitted. Needless to say, nobody wanted to top that list! </P><P>But while transparency can drive comparison – and action – too much transparency can, ironically, work against the end goal of improving performance. Today’s sustainability ratings address factors ranging from environmental emissions to the diversity of the workforce to the compensation of the CEO. These myriad measurements, summed up under the umbrella of “environmental, social and governance” (ESG) metrics, are rarely presented in a way that enables easy comparison between companies. In essence, when we measure too much, we can lose the signal in the noise. </P><P>One good example of this is the Global Reporting Initiative, which advertises as the de-facto global standard for corporate sustainability reporting. It encompasses about 90 “key” performance indicators, which require companies to gather together reams of information. To put this in context, the 2014 survey for the Dow Jones Sustainability Index was 129 pages long! </P><P>Not only are these reports a lot of work, but their complexity makes them inaccessible to most people. Several firms attempt to function as a go-between, summing up these disclosures into easily-digestible sustainability ratings and rankings. But the broadness of the ESG spectrum makes these ratings nearly meaningless. </P><P>Boiling down these numerous issues under the “corporate sustainability” label – which can include almost anything – requires tough choices. Stakeholders need to align on the issues that are most critical and that have the highest potential payoff for people and the planet.</P><P>The US Food and Drug Administration’s food labeling may be a good model for sustainability reporting. Faced with a wide array of diet-related health issues, the administration was tasked with creating a standardized disclosure that was easily understood and which allowed easy comparison between foodstuffs. Its solution – the ubiquitous FDA nutrition label – accomplished that goal with a flexible and responsive reporting instrument that consumers could easily use. People who are trying to lose weight can easily scan calories and carbs. People with high blood pressure can scan sodium content. In essence, the FDA took complex and vital information and made it actionable.</P><P>Creating a sustainability reporting “nutrition label” is possible, but difficult. Getting agreement on a critical few items for consistent, comparable reporting will take a lot of work, but, the payoff of getting this right could be massive. Imagine the impact if consumers could easily compare the sustainability performance of competing products at the point of purchase. Or, if socially conscious investors were able to review the sustainability performance of companies as easily as their financial reports. It could change the nature of reporting, and of market involvement in sustainability.</P><P>Almost 30 years ago, I learned an important lesson about the power of transparency to achieve good in the world. Now that sustainability reporting is commonplace, perhaps we can re-think our approach to get more value from our investment in transparency. By simplifying corporate sustainability reports to generate meaningful and comparable data, we could fuel a race to the top by unleashing competition to achieve the best performance on the most important sustainability issues. </P><P><EM>Tim Mohin is director of <A href=""http://www.amd.com/en-us/who-we-are/corporate-responsibility"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">corporate responsibility for Advanced Micro Devices</A> (AMD) and the author of the book <A href=""http://www.timmohin.com/books/changing-business-from-the-inside-out-a-treehuggers-guide-to-corporate-resposibility/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Changing Business from the Inside Out: A Treehugger’s Guide to Working in Corporations</A>. </EM><EM>His opinions in this blog and his book are his own.

The motivation behind the selection of a guest speaker, a process that engages MIT faculty and doctoral students in the selection, is to invite an MIT alum who can elucidate a path for new PhDs and ScDs as they begin their careers. “We are delighted that Dr. Su will return to MIT this June,” said Chancellor Barnhart, host of the ceremony. “As an industry leader with a technical background, her perspective will resonate deeply with our doctoral candidates.”</P><P>Eric Grimson, chancellor for academic advancement, chairs the Commencement Committee. “It has been a terrific experience to collaborate with our faculty and students over the last three seasons to identify inspirational alumni to speak at hooding,” he said. “Dr. Su honors us with her participation, which continues what we hope will grow to be a rich MIT tradition.”</P><P>Su moved with her family to the United States from Taiwan as a young child. After her early education in New York City, she matriculated at MIT to study electrical engineering. Su manufactured test silicon wafers as part of the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, in addition to working during the summer at Analog Devices, on whose board she now serves and where she developed a passion for semiconductors and began to see their potential to change the world. The focus of her doctoral research was silicon-on-insulator technology.</P><P>After beginning her career as a technical staff member in the Semiconductor Process and Device Center at Texas Instruments, Su spent 13 years at IBM. There, she directed engineering and business operations in multiple roles that included vice president of the Semiconductor Research and Development Center, which was responsible for the strategic direction of IBM’s silicon technologies, joint development alliances, and semiconductor research and development operations. She then led technology roadmap and research and development efforts at Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. as chief technology officer, later serving as senior vice president and general manager for networking and multimedia. This latter role comprised responsibility for global strategy, marketing, and engineering for Freescale’s embedded communications and applications processor business.</P><P>Su joined AMD in 2012 as senior vice president and general manager for global business units, responsible for driving end-to-end business execution of AMD’s products and solutions. In 2014, she became chief operating officer, charged to integrate AMD’s business units, sales, global operations, and infrastructure enablement teams into a single market-facing organization responsible for all aspects of product strategy and execution. Today, as CEO, Su is credited for leadership that has sharpened AMD’s focus and restored market performance.</P><P>The announcement of Su as the 2017 hooding speaker was met with great enthusiasm in her home department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Anantha Chandrakasan, the Vannevar Bush Professor and department head, said, “We are thrilled that Dr. Lisa Su will be the guest speaker at this year’s ceremony. She has held the highest leadership positions in major semiconductor companies and is a tremendous role model for our students. Dr. Su has had an impact in a broad range of technologies, from semiconductor devices and computing architectures to embedded systems and cloud computing. We look forward to hearing her perspectives and advice to the doctoral candidates.”</P><P>Su has published more than 40 technical articles and was named a fellow of the Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineers in 2009. She was named a Top Semiconductor CEO on <EM>Institutional Investor</EM> magazine’s All-America Executive Team 2017 and, in 2016, received the Pinnacle Award as an Outstanding 50 Asian American in Business from the Asian American Business Development Center. Su was named “2014 Executive of the Year” at the Electrical Engineering Times and EDN 2014 Annual Creativity in Electronics Awards and was honored in <EM>Technology Review</EM>’<EM>s</EM> Top 100 Young Innovators in 2002. She serves on the board of directors for Analog Devices, the Global Semiconductor Alliance, and the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association.</P><P>The 2017 Investiture of Doctoral Hoods will take place on June 8 at 10 a.m. in the Johnson Athletics Center Ice Rink. The ceremony is open to family and friends of doctoral candidates; no tickets are required.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></BODY></HTML>"

By Lewis Crofts.</H4><P>Intel told judges at the EU’s highest court today that antitrust investigators were over-reaching when prosecuting the chipmaker for rebate deals in China. Challenging a record 1.06 billion euro fine, the company said “minuscule” sales had reached Europe, while the European Commission rejected attempts to reframe the “exclusionary” rebates as “low prices.”</P><P>The judge leading the court’s questions explored why a meeting with a Dell executive wasn’t recorded. Meanwhile, another senior member of the panel probed the jurisdiction of EU antitrust law and the legal categorization of rebates.</P><P>The commission fined Intel in May 2009 for abusing its power on the market for x86 central processing units, or CPUs, to the detriment of a rival manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD.</P><P>According to the commission, Intel’s illegal conduct was two-fold: firstly, giving rebates to computer manufacturers — Dell, HP, NEC and Lenovo — if they bought all, or almost all, of their processors from Intel. This was also combined with direct payments to a German retailer Media Saturn Holding for stocking only Intel products.</P><P>Secondly, Intel paid HP, Acer and Lenovo to limit or delay rival AMD-equipped products and squeeze them out of sales channels, the commission found.</P><P>At a four-day hearing in 2012, Intel tried to overturn the fine, arguing its rebate strategy — once called the “mother of all programs” — didn’t fall foul of antitrust law. In 2014, the lower-tier General Court dismissed Intel’s appeal in its entirety.</P><P>Today, the chipmaker came before judges at the Court of Justice, making a final attempt to defeat the commission’s case.</P><P>The litigation is closely followed because a future ruling will set out the legal boundaries of the thorny issue of rebates, and establish how far the EU can go in applying its antitrust laws to behavior on other continents.</P><H4>Jurisdiction</H4><P>The major flashpoint between the two sides is whether EU law can catch rebate payments made by Intel to computer makers in China.</P><P>Intel had argued that the chips were sold outside of Europe. The fact that some computers with Intel chips had ended up in Europe didn’t amount to an illegal rebates scheme on EU soil, it said. The lower-court disagreed, ruling that Intel’s conduct was indeed implemented in Europe and had effects there, and therefore the commission had cleared the necessary hurdle for wielding EU antitrust law.</P><P>The commission said the rebate scheme had changed the structure of the world market and compared it to “stay-at-home” cartels — previously punished in the EU — where Japanese companies had purposely kept out of Europe. In short, conduct in foreign climes can impact European consumers.</P><P>Daniel Beard, for Intel, stressed that the “decisive factor” was where the implementation took place: in this case, China. He added that a second strand of case law that assesses whether foreign conduct had “qualified effects” in Europe didn’t “expand” beyond the initial implementation test.</P><P>“The commission didn’t have jurisdiction over the Lenovo agreement, in line with the principles of international law,” Beard said. “Any other approach would be a huge expansion of the extra-territorial effect of EU law over conduct around the world.”</P><P>Nicholas Khan, for the commission, said Intel never raised concerns over jurisdiction during the long-running probe.</P><P>“The commission is not asserting some sort of universal jurisdiction,” he told judges. Rather, Intel’s agreement with Lenovo specifically referenced “worldwide” sales, he said.</P><P>There would be a “circumvention risk” if massive global companies with large market shares could evade prosecution, Khan argued. “The effects of Intel’s conduct were immediate and foreseeable. The effect on the [European] market was direct and not merely a knock-on effect.”</P><P>Jean-François Bellis, appearing for the Association for Competitive Technology — a trade group of 3,000 tech firms — supported Intel, stressing the conduct took place in China.</P><P>He said the association was “very concerned” about the judgment, given it would broaden EU jurisdiction and open the door to multiple probes and multiple private lawsuits.</P><P>Advocate General Nils Wahl asked Khan if the commission was “stretching” the idea of “implementation” even beyond “stay-at-home” cartels to capture the kind of behavior perpetrated by Intel.</P><P>Khan said it was important to look at the kind of conduct at issue, whether it was a cartel or the abuse of market power.</P><P>“By securing the exclusion of AMD through what we said was an abusive method, then it follows that the conduct is implemented,” he said.</P><H4>Loyalty rebates</H4><P>The case centers on Intel’s system of “exclusivity rebates,” which, according to the commission, bought the loyalty of computer makers and squeezed out rival AMD. Intel’s program meant that for AMD to enter the market it not only had to offer rebates on its own products, but it also had to make up for buyers losing their Intel rebates by switching providers.</P><P>This conduct was illegal in itself and so judges at the General Court ruled EU investigators didn’t have to run a full investigation into the economic effects. It meant there was no need to analyze whether a similar company with the same costs could have offered the same rebates.</P><P>That test — known as the “as-efficient-competitor test” — wasn’t necessary to rule Intel had broken antitrust law, they said. With that statement, the court effectively made it easier for EU officials to punish such behavior, saying the 150 pages of economists’ number-crunching in the decision weren’t necessary.</P><P>Much of this morning’s hearing went over the formal classification of rebates under previous EU judgments. These set out how far officials must go in assessing the general context of the rebates — such as how long they last and how much of the market they cover — to rule them illegal.</P><P>Beard, for Intel, said the company’s rebates affected a “minuscule” amount of sales into Europe and it was necessary to examine “all the relevant facts and circumstances” of the scheme, not just rule the system was illegal.</P><P>He said the commission ran an “as-efficient-competitor test” and then chose to ignore it because it “no longer helped them.” The regulator couldn’t “simply ignore an inconvenient truth,” he said.</P><H4>Danish Post</H4><P>Advocate-General Wahl examined the importance of an October ruling concerning postal rebates in Denmark, asking if it a shone new light on the legality of Intel’s behavior.</P><P>In that case, the Court of Justice said that the rebate scheme run by Post Danmark for advertising mail — which involved a payment depending on volumes of mail sent — needed to be analyzed in full to see if it restricted competition.</P><P>The judgment set out categories for certain kinds of rebates, implying that exclusivity rebates — potentially such as those used by Intel — could be deemed illegal without the need for such a full assessment.</P><P>Khan argued the ruling “reinforced the correctness” of the commission’s case. “A loyalty rebate, such as in the present case, infringes [competition law] without the need for any further assessment,” he said.</P><P>The commission’s lawyer said it was “difficult to think of a better established category of abuse,” and Intel had pursued a strategy of “marginalizing” AMD.</P><P>Bellis stressed that the Post Danmark judgment required loyalty rebates be “coupled with an obligation for, or promise by, purchasers to obtain all or a given proportion of their supplies from the supplier.”</P><P>Khan said the threat from Intel was clear: “It is not correct that Dell was left simply with an impression as to what might happen to its rebates . . . if it broke with Intel,” he said. “Intel made clear to Dell the price of disloyalty.”</P><H4>Strict</H4><P>Advocate-General Wahl pushed the commission on why such a rebate scheme was illegal without the need for a full assessment of the circumstances, such a market coverage or duration.</P><P>He said the commission’s approach — supported by the lower-court — seemed “very strict.”</P><P>“I cannot see any other instance of an abuse of a dominant position where the commission or the case law of the court, as you interpret it, has such a strict approach,” he said. “Is this the most damaging thing we can see or is this just tip of the iceberg [of conduct] that would be prohibited simply due to its form?”</P><P>“This is a matter of an abuse by the nature of the arrangements made,” Khan answered. He stressed EU law allowed for companies to “objectively justify” their behavior, but that Intel hadn’t tried to do this.</P><P>Eugene Regan, a judge, asked whether the court could feel “comfortable” with the imposition of a large fine on the basis of an “assumption” — about the lawfulness of the rebates — and “without an appropriate analysis of all the other elements.”</P><P>Khan argued that the commission’s work had gathered a wealth of evidence that proved Intel’s conduct had changed the market structure and restricted choice.</P><P>Moreover, Intel was a huge company with a turnover of $175 billion during the period of the infringement. “On the facts of this case, this is clearly an abuse and the decision and the fine are entirely justified,” he said.</P><H4>Meeting Mr. D1</H4><P>José Luís da Cruz Vilaça, the judge leading the panel’s questions, focused on why the commission hadn’t documented a meeting with a Dell executive — referred to in court as Mr. D1.</P><P>During the probe, the commission spoke to the man for five hours, gathering information on Intel’s rebate scheme.</P><P>Intel complained the meeting should have been recorded and it should have obtained his statement, which could have helped it defend itself against the EU investigation.</P><P>Beard, for Intel, was scathing of the commission’s procedures, saying his client’s rights of defense had been abused. He said the lower-court was wrong to conclude that Mr. D1’s evidence could be “reconstituted” from other submissions.</P><P>“Kafka would be proud,” Beard submitted. “You can’t know what was in the absent material. That is not fair procedure. That is not justice.”</P><P>Khan argued Mr. D1 was simply representing Dell’s position — later obtained in writing — and he wasn’t “some sort of maverick who [was] able to shed fresh light on information that was received from Dell in its corporate capacity.”</P><P>Da Cruz Vilaça pushed the commission on the legal basis for its interview with Mr. D1, asking why it was classified as a conversation and not a formal interview that would be documented.</P><P>Khan said Mr. D1 wasn’t formally “convoked” for the meeting and the regulator was free to choose its investigative steps. The procedural laws allowed for different means of gathering evidence and a formal written request to the company was the most powerful.</P><P>“How can you establish in advance which type of interview — formal or informal — you will be carrying out in a specific instance?” da Cruz Vilaça asked, casting doubt over how officials could switch between one form and another mid-interview.</P><P>“The commission obtained information in the usual way from Dell through requests for information,” Khan said. “An informal meeting with a person is something that is of preparatory nature. It was to explore further avenues for investigation in relation to Dell.”</P><P>Advocate-General Wahl didn’t give a date for when he would issue his non-binding opinion on the case.</P><P>The case reference is C-413/13 P.</P><SECTION class=""share-links""><DIV class=""title"">Share this </DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The system is powered by <A href=""https://venturebeat.com/2011/10/11/oak-ridge-national-labs-uses-amd-and-nvidia-chips-for-huge-cray-supercomputer/"">thousands of microprocessors from Advanced Micro Devices and graphics chips from Nvidia</A>. It can perform more than 20 petaflops (20 million billion floating-point math operations per second), and will be used to solve all sorts of tough computing problems such as calculating the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> on the Earth.</P><P>Made by Cray, Titan, also known as the Cray XK7 supercomputer, has some gargantuan specifications. The machine has the computing power that is equal to 500,000 laptop computers, or 20,000 trillion calculations per second. It has 18,688 compute nodes, or servers that are part of the larger supercomputer. It has 299,008 AMD Opteron cores, or microprocessor brains. It has 18,688 Nvidia Tesla K20 “Kepler” graphics accelerators. It also has 710 terabytes of system memory, and total peak system performance of 20 petaflops. The system has 200 server cabinets and a sophisticated cooling system. Each computing node has an AMD Opteron 6274 processor and an Nvidia GPU.</P><P>Nvidia says about 90 percent of the mathematical floating-point capability comes from its Tesla K20 graphics processing unit (GPU). The power efficiency of GPUs, which process lots of tasks in parallel, enables much more efficient computing to happen on Titan.</P><P>“We can augment the CPUs to provide power efficiency that is far better,” said Sumit Gupta, general manager of Nvidia’s Tesla GPU business. “This is like putting 500,000 laptops in a space the size of a basketball court.”</P><P>The supercomputer will attack problems related to <mark>climate change</mark>, biofuels, materials science, astrophysics, combustion, and nuclear energy. Scientists using the supercomputers will use it to make more efficient engines, higher capacity and lighter weight batteries, and search for cures for diseases.</P><P>Operated by the <A href=""http://science.energy.gov"">U.S. Department of Energy</A>‘s Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, Titan is another step toward an exascale computer, which targets performance of 1,000 petaflops by 2020. The supercomputer is part of an “open science” program that allows researchers from academia, industry and government to use it to solve all sorts of problems.</P><P>The machine is ten times faster and five times more energy efficient than its predecessor, the 2.3-petaflop Jaguar system, while occupying the same floor space. If Oak Ridge had upgrade the CPU-only Jaguar system by adding more microprocessors, the system would have been four times larger and consume more than 30 megawatts of power. That’s enough to power tens of thousands of homes. Jaguar itself required 7 megawatts, or enough to power 7,000 homes.</P><P>“Basing Titan on Tesla GPUs allows Oak Ridge to run phenomenally complex applications at scale, and validates the use of accelerated computing to address our most pressing scientific problems,” said Steve Scott, chief technology officer of the GPU Accelerated Computing business at Nvidia. “You simply can’t get these levels of performance, power- and cost-efficiency with conventional CPU-based architectures. Accelerated computing is the best and most realistic approach to enable exascale performance levels within the next decade.”</P><P>Work on Titan began three years ago with Oak Ridge’s plant to upgrade Jaguar, which was one of the former most powerful supercomputers in the world. Titan has three times the performance per watt of power used and three times higher performance per unit server.</P><P>“Science and technology have always been our primary goal, and Titan is a groundbreaking tool that will allow researchers worldwide to leverage GPU-accelerated computing to make unparalleled breakthroughs,” said Jeff Nichols, associate laboratory director for computing and computational sciences at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. “The new Tesla GPU accelerators offer the performance and energy efficiency that enable Titan to scale to unprecedented performance levels without consuming the energy equivalent of a small city.”</P><P>The Energy Department has awarded 4.7 billion hours of computing time on Titan and other supercomputers to 61 science and engineering projects with high potential for accelerating discovery and <mark>innovation</mark> through its <A href=""http://www.doeleadershipcomputing.org/awards/2013INCITEFactSheets.pdf"">Incite</A> program. For instance, the department gave Boris Kozinsky of the Robert Bosch Corp. a grant 48 million core hours to discover and optimize new classes battery technology.</P><P> </P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Security researchers on Wednesday disclosed a set of security flaws that they said could let hackers steal sensitive information from nearly every modern computing device containing chips from Intel Corp, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and ARM Holdings.
One of the bugs is specific to Intel but another affects laptops, desktop computers, smartphones, tablets and internet servers alike. Intel and ARM insisted that the issue was not a design flaw, but it will require users to download a patch and update their operating system to fix.
“Phones, PCs, everything are going to have some impact, but it’ll vary from product to product,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in an interview with CNBC Wednesday afternoon.
Researchers with Alphabet Inc’s Google Project Zero, in conjunction with academic and industry researchers from several countries, discovered two flaws.
The first, called Meltdown, affects Intel chips and lets hackers bypass the hardware barrier between applications run by users and the computer’s memory, potentially letting hackers read a computer’s memory and steal passwords.
The second, called Spectre, affects chips from Intel, AMD and ARM and lets hackers potentially trick otherwise error-free applications into giving up secret information.
The researchers said Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp had patches ready for users for desktop computers affected by Meltdown. Microsoft declined to comment and Apple did not immediately return requests for comment.
Daniel Gruss, one of the researchers at Graz University of Technology who discovered Meltdown, called it “probably one of the worst CPU bugs ever found” in an interview with Reuters.
Gruss said Meltdown was the more serious problem in the short term but could be decisively stopped with software patches. Spectre, the broader bug that applies to nearly all computing devices, is harder for hackers to take advantage of but less easily patched and will be a bigger problem in the long term, he said.
The flaws were first reported by tech publication The Register. It also reported that the updates to fix the problems could causes Intel chips to operate 5 percent to 30 percent more slowly.
AMD chips are also affected by at least one variant of a set of security flaws but that it can be patched with a software update. The company said it believes there “is near zero risk to AMD products at this time.”
Google said in a blog post that Android phones running the latest security updates are protected, as are its own Nexus and Pixel phones with the latest security updates. Gmail users do not need to take any additional action to protect themselves, but users of its Chromebooks, Chrome web browser and many of its Google Cloud services will need to install updates.
“The current Intel problem, if true, would likely not require CPU replacement in our opinion. However the situation is fluid,” Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities in New York said in a note, adding it could hurt the company’s reputation.

One is &quot;25-by-20&quot; which is to increase the energy efficiency of our CPUs or processors 25 times by 2020. Now it's trickling down to graphics.&quot;</SPAN></P><P>AMD created a 30 percent more energy efficient graphics card with a changed circuitry design. It packs transistors on a chip much closer together to reduce the number of escaping electrons.</P><P>&quot;When you make a CPU or graphics chip, they are so small that individual electrons can escape. When that happens, that’s wasted energy and it adds heat,&quot; Hallock said. A new manufacturing technology &quot;allows us to clamp down on that.&quot; </P><P>In its study, AMD said that if, hypothetically, all the 15.8 million performance-class graphic processing chips sold in 2015 were replaced by this new version, the electricity savings could be 2.8 billion kilowatt hours. That would translate to preventing 1.9 million metric tons of <mark>CO2</mark> from being emitted into the atmosphere, AMD said, although it acknowledged that not all graphic chips sold in 2015 will be replaced.  </P><P>Justin Murrill, global sustainability manager at AMD, said the microprocessing efficiency gains &quot;are already ahead of schedule&quot; and well on their way to meet the &quot;25-by-20&quot; goal.</P><H3>Intel </H3><P>For five decades Moore’s Law was the ruling trajectory of computing <mark>innovation</mark>. Postulated by Intel co-founder and CEO Gordon Moore in 1965, it held that the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits would double every 18 months and thus effectively deliver twice the processing for the same price. </P><P><SPAN>About six months ago, Intel said that dictum no longer was realistic and should no longer be the driver of <mark>innovation</mark>. For one, it is becoming physically impossible to exponentially grow the number of transistors on a chip every year-and-a-half ad infinitum. And secondly, chips have become so ubiquitous and </SPAN><SPAN>the power they demand so great that energy efficiency should emerge as a significant driver of <mark>innovation</mark>.</SPAN></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>If all computers achieved a 30 percent average energy reduction, U.S. consumers could save $3 billion a year, reduce electricity use by 29 billion kilowatt-hours annually.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></SECTION><P><SPAN><SPAN>William Holt, Intel's technology and manufacturing chief, <A href=""http://www.pcworld.com/article/3031222/tech-events-dupe/future-intel-chip-tech-will-sacrifice-speed-gains-for-power-efficiency.html"">reportedly</A> told last winter's Solid State Circuits Conference that energy efficiency will need to be as important as performance going forward.</SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Hold said that doubling the processing speed for the same amount of electricity use would be the new driver. The company set out developing chips that use less energy. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Intel aggressively markets its energy efficient Xeon line of chips for powering data centers and industrial servers. Data centers are <A href=""https://www.greenbiz.com/article/3-steps-drive-data-center-efficiency"">huge power consumers</A>.</SPAN><SPAN> The Xeon line promises fast performance while being energy efficient. Of course, it is all relative.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>But marketing for Intel's Core processor for desktop computing is all about processing speed and performance, not energy efficiency. This is also the case with its Core i7 Extreme Edition for gaming and video graphics and production.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>But the tides may be turning.  </SPAN></P><P>As smartphones and everyday gadgets with microprocessors in them mean a proliferation of tiny processors, the chip architecture used in those gadgets, Advanced RISC Machine architecture (ARM), is more energy efficient, according to <A href=""http://qz.com/741078/a-company-that-doesnt-really-make-chips-dethroned-intel-with-super-savvy-business-moves/"">Quartz</A>. </P><H3>Computers heretofore exempt?</H3><P>Even as energy efficiency standards have been issued for refrigerators, washing machines and all manner of home appliances, they haven't existed for computers and monitors, NRDC says.</P><P>&quot;If all computers achieved a 30 percent average energy reduction, U.S. consumers could save $3 billion a year, reduce electricity use by 29 billion kilowatt-hours annually — equal to the power consumed by all the households in the cities of Los Angeles and Chicago combined,&quot; NRDC said in its report. That in turn would &quot;keep 20 million metric tons of <mark>climate</mark>-disrupting <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> out of the atmosphere, all with zero impact on computer performance or user convenience.&quot;</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""field field-name-field-greenbiz-topics-ref field-type-entityreference field-label-inline clearfix""><DIV class=""field-label"">Topics: </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

			Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Stock on Massive Profit Growth		</H1><H2 class=""post-title1"">AMD Stock is way better than it looks</H2></HEADER><FIGURE class=""entry-featured-image""><FIGCAPTION><P class=""source"">Source: <A href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/rutlo/4252743250/"">Matthew Rutledge via Flickr</A></P></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><DIV class=""entry-content"" itemprop=""description""><P><STRONG>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.</STRONG> (NASDAQ:<SPAN class=""stock-ticker""><A href=""https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/amd-stock-quote/""><STRONG><U>AMD</U></STRONG></A></SPAN>) stock has taken a substantial hit over the last few weeks. Security flaw revelations had some speculating that AMD stock would fall to $0. That combined with reported production issues have reduced the stock price by about 25% in just the last four weeks.</P><P>However, despite the bad news, AMD’s move into graphics chips has turned years of losses into massive profit growth. A reduced stock price stemming from negative press combined with profit increases may be creating the perfect buying opportunity for Advanced Micro Devices stock.</P><H3>Graphics Chips Revitalized AMD</H3><P>I described AMD in a <A href=""https://investorplace.com/2018/02/advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-stock-better-other-chip-stock/"" target=""_blank"">previous article</A> as a “better ‘other’ chip stock.” The company spent most of its history as the arch rival of <STRONG>Intel Corporation </STRONG>(NASDAQ:<SPAN class=""stock-ticker""><A href=""https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/intc-stock-quote/""><STRONG><U>INTC</U></STRONG></A></SPAN>). Although Intel dominated this market, AMD carved out a niche by producing lower-cost processors.</P><P>However, as PCs evolved into niche products, the market changed, and AMD moved into graphics chips. Today, most analysts would describe AMD as the arch rival of <STRONG>Nvidia Corporation</STRONG> (NASDAQ:<SPAN class=""stock-ticker""><A href=""https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/nvda-stock-quote/""><STRONG><U>NVDA</U></STRONG></A></SPAN>).</P><P>It has even teamed up with Intel to take on NVDA. However, with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), and cryptocurrencies, entering the market for graphics chips has proved to be a fortuitous move.</P><H3>AMD Will Avoid a Takeover</H3><P>Still, AMD stock suffered in March as news of flaws in its Ryzen chips sent the stock downward. It fell further as production issues with Ryzen chips and Radeon graphics processors came to light. Unlike Intel or <STRONG>Micron Technology, Inc.</STRONG> (NASDAQ:<SPAN class=""stock-ticker""><A href=""https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/mu-stock-quote/""><STRONG><U>MU</U></STRONG></A></SPAN>), AMD does not own fabs. Hence, it relies on partners for production, which puts the firm at a disadvantage.</P><P><A href=""https://viceroyresearch.org/2018/03/13/amd-the-obituary/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Viceroy Research</A> speculated that the flaws would send AMD stock to $0. History has shown that issues such as these do not destroy companies. Intel stock trades at a higher rise despite revelations in January of security flaws in its chips.</P><P>As for production issues, the price system tends to ensure that production capacity will appear when chip prices run high enough. Hence, investors should view production as a solvable problem.</P><P>Many, including some of my <EM>InvestorPlace</EM> colleagues, have speculated that a rival company will buy AMD. A merger might make sense financially. However, the Trump Administration has blocked the attempted purchase of <STRONG>Qualcomm, Inc.</STRONG> (NASDAQ:<SPAN class=""stock-ticker""><A href=""https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/qcom-stock-quote/""><STRONG><U>QCOM</U></STRONG></A></SPAN>) by <STRONG>Broadcom Ltd</STRONG> (NASDAQ:<SPAN class=""stock-ticker""><A href=""https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/avgo-stock-quote/""><STRONG><U>AVGO</U></STRONG></A></SPAN>).	</P><P>It also thwarted attempts by <STRONG>T-Mobile Us Inc</STRONG> (NASDAQ:<SPAN class=""stock-ticker""><A href=""https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/tmus-stock-quote/""><STRONG><U>TMUS</U></STRONG></A></SPAN>) to buy <STRONG>Sprint Corp</STRONG> (NYSE:<SPAN class=""stock-ticker""><A href=""https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/s-stock-quote/""><STRONG><U>S</U></STRONG></A></SPAN>). With its second-place position in both graphics chips and PC processors, the federal government will likely block any attempts to take over AMD.</P><H3>The case for AMD stock</H3><P>So, assuming AMD stock is here to stay, investors must ask themselves if and where to buy. The equity offers compelling benefits. First, analysts believe profits will rise by more than sevenfold this year.</P><P>They also expect profits to increase by more than 50% in both 2019 and 2020. At a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio that stands under 23, this level of profit growth creates a compelling buy case.</P><P>Moreover, the second-place market position for its graphics processors further bolsters the buy case. Jack Welch, the longtime former CEO of <STRONG>General Electric Company</STRONG> (NYSE:<SPAN class=""stock-ticker""><A href=""https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/ge-stock-quote/""><STRONG><U>GE</U></STRONG></A></SPAN>) emphasized winning. He defined winning divisions and companies as ones that <A href=""https://blog.kissmetrics.com/winning-and-profitability/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">ranked first or second</A> in their industry. As second overall in graphics chips, and first among many crypto miners, AMD stock maintains a valuable position in its market.</P><P>And if one decides to buy, the next question relates to the price level. Although I’m generally not a chartist, double bottoms usually indicate a buy sign. AMD stock just bounced off of a 52-week low of $9.05 per share.</P><P>If it again bounces from the low $9s per share, a buy point has likely been established. Or, if the stock can rise above the previous bottom set in the high $9s per share, interested investors should look there. Either way, the recent drop in the stock price is likely driven by short-term setbacks rather than any long-term problems that threaten its existence.</P><H3>Final Thoughts on AMD stock</H3><P>Given the popularity of their chips and the reduction in the stock price, a buying opportunity is likely forming for AMD stock. To be sure, the security flaws and production issues give the stock a degree of temporary uncertainty. However, stopping AMD’s second act in graphics processors will take more than temporary setbacks.</P><P>Moreover, with profit growth increasing and the stock price falling, the opportunity to buy Advanced Micro Devices stock at a reasonable price is presenting itself. Once AMD releases its next earnings report on May 7, much of the uncertainty caused by its setbacks should disappear. With a higher degree of certainty, the stock will likely be positioned to resume its move higher.</P><P><EM>As of this writing, Will Healy is long MU stock.</EM></P></DIV></SECTION></DIV><DIV id=""printed-from""><P>Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2018/04/amd-stock-massive-profit/.</P><P>©2018 InvestorPlace Media, LLC</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

	Today, the White House will announce additional commitments from <STRONG>73 companies</STRONG> from across the American economy who are joining the American Business Act on <mark>Climate</mark> Pledge. With this announcement, a total of <STRONG>154 companies</STRONG> will have signed the American Business Act on <mark>Climate</mark> Pledge to demonstrate their support for action on <mark>climate change</mark> and the conclusion of a <mark>climate change</mark> agreement in Paris that takes a strong step forward toward a low-<mark>carbon</mark>, <mark>sustainable</mark> future.  These 154 companies <STRONG>have operations in all 50 states</STRONG>, <STRONG>employ nearly 11 million people</STRONG>, represent more than <STRONG>$4.2 trillion in annual revenue</STRONG>, and have a <STRONG>combined market capitalization of over $7 trillion.</STRONG></P><P>
	By signing the American Business Act on <mark>Climate</mark> pledge, these companies are:</P><UL><LI>
		Voicing support for a strong Paris outcome. The pledge recognizes those countries that have already put forward <mark>climate</mark> targets, and voices support for a strong outcome in the Paris <mark>climate</mark> negotiations.</LI><LI>
		Demonstrating an ongoing commitment to <mark>climate</mark> action. As part of this initiative, each company is announcing significant pledges to reduce their emissions, increase low-<mark>carbon</mark> investments, deploy more clean energy, and take other actions to build more <mark>sustainable</mark> businesses and tackle <mark>climate change</mark>.</LI></UL><P>
	These pledges include ambitious, company-specific goals such as:</P><UL style=""list-style-type:circle""><LI>
		Reducing emissions by as much as 50 percent,</LI><LI>
		Reducing water usage by as much as 80 percent,</LI><LI>
		Achieving zero waste-to-landfill,</LI><LI>
		Purchasing 100 percent renewable energy, and</LI><LI>
		Pursuing zero net deforestation in supply chains.</LI><LI>
		Setting an example for their peers. Today’s announcements builds on the launch of the American Business Act on <mark>Climate</mark> Pledge in July, and the second round of announcements in October.</LI></UL><P>
	The impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> are already being felt worldwide. Nineteen of the 20 hottest years on record occurred in the past two decades. Countries and communities around the world are already being affected by deeper, more persistent droughts, pounded by more severe weather, inundated by bigger storm surges, and imperiled by more frequent and dangerous wildfires. Rising temperatures can lead to more smog, longer allergy seasons, and an increased incidence of extreme-weather-related injuries, all of which imperil public health, particularly for vulnerable populations like children, the elderly, the sick, the poor, and some communities of color. No corner of the planet and no sector of the global economy will remain unaffected by <mark>climate change</mark> in the years ahead.</P><P>
	<mark>Climate change</mark> is a global challenge that demands a global response, and President Obama is committed to leading the fight. The President’s <mark>Climate</mark> Action Plan, when fully implemented, will cut nearly 6 billion tons of <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> through 2030, an amount equivalent to taking all the cars in the United States off the road for more than 4 years. The Clean Power Plan, the most significant domestic step any President has ever taken to combat <mark>climate change</mark>, will reduce emissions from the energy sector by 32% by 2030. And while the United States is leading on the international stage and the federal government is doing its part to combat <mark>climate change</mark>, hundreds of private companies, local governments, and foundations have stepped up to <A href=""/the-press-office/2014/09/18/fact-sheet-white-house-announces-executive-actions-and-commitments-acros"">increase energy efficiency</A>, <A href=""/the-press-office/2015/06/16/fact-sheet-obama-administration-announces-more-4-billion-private-sector"">boost low-<mark>carbon</mark> investing</A>, and <A href=""/the-press-office/2015/07/07/fact-sheet-administration-announces-new-initiative-increase-solar-access"">make solar energy more accessible</A> to low-income Americans.</P><P>
	The measures taken by the public and private sectors enabled President Obama to set an ambitious but achievable goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions economy-wide by 26-28% by 2025 last November. And in the eleven months since, we’ve seen unprecedented global momentum in the fight against <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>
	To date, more than 180 countries representing nearly 95% of global <mark>carbon</mark> emissions have reported post-2020 <mark>climate</mark> policies to the United Nations. This includes the major economies like the U.S., China, the European Union and India and it includes a large number of smaller economies, developing nations, island states and tropical countries – some of whom are the most vulnerable to the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>
	As the world looks toward Paris, President Obama is committed to building on this momentum, with American leadership at all levels – the federal government, state and local governments and the private sector.</P><P class=""rtecenter"">

On the Q1 earnings call, the firm announced plans to roll out its next-gen 7-nanometer chip production by the end of 2018.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></LI><LI class=""js-stream-content"" data-reactid=""229""><DIV class=""Py(14px) Pos(r)"" data-test-locator=""mega"" data-reactid=""230""><DIV class=""Cf"" data-reactid=""231""><DIV class=""Ov(h) Pend(14%) Pend(0)--sm1024"" data-reactid=""232""><DIV class=""C(#959595) Fz(11px) D(ib) Mb(6px)"" data-reactid=""233""><SPAN data-reactid=""234"">Investopedia</SPAN><I aria-hidden=""true"" class=""Mx(4px)"" data-reactid=""235"">•</I><SPAN data-reactid=""236"">3 days ago</SPAN></DIV><H3 class=""Mb(5px)"" data-reactid=""237""><A href=""/m/e26263de-28bc-3fbf-b435-fdfc565fecd7/brian-kelly-launches.html"" target=""_self"" class=""Fw(b) Fz(20px) Lh(23px) LineClamp(2,46px) Fz(17px)--sm1024 Lh(19px)--sm1024 LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 Td(n) C(#0078ff):h C(#000)"" data-reactid=""238"">Brian Kelly Launches Blockchain ETF</A></H3><P class=""Fz(14px) Lh(19px) Fz(13px)--sm1024 Lh(17px)--sm1024 LineClamp(3,57px) LineClamp(3,51px)--sm1024 M(0)"" data-reactid=""241"">The blockchain based investment space is getting crowded.

There have been so many rebuttals to these articles that a summary of all the accusations, counter-points and the general fallout was published in <A rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2012/09/25/whole-story-data-centers"" target=""_hplink"">GreenBiz.com</A>.</P><P>While there is not much more that can be said in the point-counterpoint sparked by these articles, we should thank Mr. Glanz for bringing additional attention to this issue. Just about any process or service you can think of is being digitized and moved to &quot;the cloud.&quot; This has created a tectonic shift in our way of life and it is absolutely appropriate to examine the impacts from all angles, including environmental impact. Here is one more...</P><P><STRONG>One More Angle</STRONG>
I got the impression from <EM>The New York Times</EM> articles that most of traffic though data centers is for frivolous uses like social media updates, old forgotten photos, or storing old email. When coupled with the seemingly massive use of energy needed to power data centers, the implication is that the ongoing digitization of our lives is both very wasteful and damaging to the environment. </P><P>Let's stipulate that, like breathing or ocean tides, we cannot and should not stop the trend toward a digital society. Let's also stipulate that it is absolute folly to attempt to regulate what people can and cannot do on the Internet in the name of energy efficiency. </P><P>If these stipulations seem like common sense to you, as they do to me, then what are we left with? The answer is Dr. Jon Koomey's widely accepted estimate that less than 2 percent of all electricity generated in the U.S. is consumed by data centers.  </P><P><STRONG>Brown Clouds and Green Clouds</STRONG>
While less than two percent may seem quite small in comparison to the obvious benefits of the digital age, this is no excuse for wasting power. Mr. Glanz's articles focused on some examples that seem very wasteful and, based on our experience can be corrected. AMD operates its own cloud data center infrastructure with a utilization rate approaching 90 percent which is a stark contrast to the image of 90 percent of data center equipment sitting idle reported by Mr. Glanz. Even the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), in their <A rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/28/opinion/a-dirty-internet-how-data-centers-waste-energy.html"" target=""_hplink"">response</A> to these articles noted the distinction between wasteful and well managed data centers:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>&quot;...not all clouds are created equal; there are &quot;green&quot; clouds and &quot;brown&quot; clouds. Those that carry out energy-efficiency best practices and use low-<mark>carbon</mark> energy sources are far more <mark>sustainable</mark> than typical server rooms.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&quot;If done right, by using cleaner power sources and significantly reducing energy waste, cloud data centers and server rooms can be part of the solution. They can transform the way we live and work to be more <mark>sustainable</mark> while saving billions of dollars in electricity costs a year.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Incentives to Save not Waste</STRONG>
In reality, energy costs and environmental protection are dominant concerns in the data center industry. For example, the operational cost of a server - which is almost entirely electricity - often exceeds its capital cost over its useful life.  In addition to the power used by servers and IT equipment, the electricity demand from non-IT equipment in the data center, such as cooling systems, power delivery systems and lighting, can be substantial -- averaging 80 percent of the power used to run the IT equipment.  </P><P>With such obvious price signals, the industry is economically motivated to reduce the power consumed by data centers. This has spawned solutions both competitive and collaborative. The Green Grid, a group that AMD helped found several years ago, has been a leader in bringing together companies in the data center value chain to develop open source standards, best practices and tools to advance data center energy efficiency. </P><P>While we support these collaborative efforts, AMD also has delivered an impressive array of energy efficient <mark>innovation</mark>s to address today's data center workloads. One example is the AMD SeaMicro SM15000™ server. Micro servers deliver massive efficiencies in power, space and bandwidth, and The SeaMicro SM15000-XE server is the highest-density, most energy-efficient system available, using half the power, one-third the space and delivering up to 12 times the bandwidth of today's best-in-class server.5 With its innovative technology and small form factor, the SeaMicro server not only reduces the power used to process data, it also reduces the power needed to run the whole data center.</P><P>The AMD SeaMicro server represents the cutting edge in energy efficient micro-servers, but the overarching point is that every company in the data center business has a natural incentive to reduce power consumption to save money. </P><P><STRONG>A Cleaner Future </STRONG>
All the energy efficiency <mark>innovation</mark>s in the world may not be able to keep up with the overall growth in the number of data centers. But what if we were able to go digital without using any fossil fuel? That is the premise of a new research project conducted jointly by AMD, HP, NYSERDA (a New York State Utility) and Clarkson University. This coalition is testing the idea of locating modular containerized data centers (or PODs) near sources of alternative energy such as solar and wind power. To keep the bits and bytes flowing when the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing, these PODs will be networked together with fiber optic cable so that the workload can be transferred to the PODs with power. </P><P>Dubbed the &quot;evergreen cloud,&quot; this research holds the promise of growing our digital society without adding environmental burden.</P><P><STRONG>Part of the Solution</STRONG>
We can argue forever whether updating our Facebook page or posting a tweet constitutes a valuable use of IT equipment. Lost in this debate however are the beneficial uses of IT. AMD has published a series of case studies demonstrating how semiconductor technology is used for everything from medical research, to education, to forecasting the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> and more. For example, NPR ran a recent <A rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2012/10/01/162080613/cloud-computing-saves-health-care-industry-time-and-money"" target=""_hplink"">story</A> on the benefits of the cloud to the health care industry that stated: </P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>&quot;The cloud's vast computing power is making it easier and less expensive for companies and clinicians to discover new drugs and medical treatments. Analyzing data that used to take years and tens of millions of dollars can now be done for a fraction of that amount.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>But these obvious IT benefits are not the end of the story:</P><P>In 2008, The <mark>Climate</mark> Group on behalf of the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI), with independent analysis by McKinsey &amp; Company published the SMART 2020 <A rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.smart2020.org/_assets/files/01_Smart2020ReportSummary.pdf"" target=""_hplink"">study</A> which found that:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P> &quot;ICT is a key sector in the fight against <mark>climate change</mark> and could enable emissions reductions of 7.8 Gt <mark>CO2</mark>e (gigatons of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide equivalent emissions) in 2020, or 15% of business as usual emissions.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>In other words, the advent of equipment ranging from smart energy meters, smart motors, smart buildings, smart grids and other IT enabled systems is essential to addressing the looming threat of <mark>climate change</mark>. According to the study: </P><BLOCKQUOTE><P> &quot;...despite its own growing <mark>carbon</mark> footprint. No other sector can supply technology capabilities so integral to energy efficiency across such a range of other sectors or industries.</P><P>&quot;While the sector plans to significantly step up the energy efficiency of its products and services, ICT's largest influence will be by enabling energy efficiencies in other sectors, an opportunity that could deliver <mark>carbon</mark> savings five times larger than the total emissions from the entire ICT sector in 2020.&quot; (Emphasis added)</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><STRONG>What if everyone was like the IT industry?</STRONG>
Green Grid board member Kathrin Winkler of EMC wrote in her <A rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://m.greenbiz.com/17574/show/b5b121ae7e41ba877d77ef0ea64165e1&amp;t=ko04a3ak9caq3l77efjmjikf91"" target=""_hplink"">rebuttal</A> to <EM>The New York Times</EM> articles, &quot;If the auto industry had gotten efficient as quickly as the IT industry in the last 40 years, we'd be getting 450,000 miles to the gallon.&quot;</P><P>This stunning statistic raises an important question: If data centers account for about two percent of the U.S. electricity consumption and have achieved huge efficiency gains, what are the consumers of the other 98 percent doing to improve energy efficiency? </P><P>The IT industry is economically motivated to produce energy efficient products and is making steady progress with both new technology and operating practices. While these <mark>innovation</mark>s reduce energy usage, the bigger story is the benefits that are produced by the use of IT equipment.  </P><P>Yes, IT products are used to tweet our lunch selections... but data centers also power lifesaving research. And on top of all that, IT equipment enables our entire society to be more efficient at a rate five times larger than the power it consumes. </P><P>Imagine if we could squeeze that kind of performance out of the other 98 percent.</P><P><EM>Tim Mohin is Director of Corporate Responsibility for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and the author of the book, Changing Business from the Inside Out: A Treehugger's Guide to Working in Corporations (Greenleaf and Berrett-Kohler).

In the United States, however, the idea of proactive government help for private industry in the name of economic development has sometimes raised concerns about distorting market forces and the wisdom of letting public servants “pick winners.” The debate began with Alexander Hamilton, who was an early advocate of “bounties” to encourage desirable industry, continued through the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century, and has resurfaced many times in the post-war era as U.S. industry confronted new competitive challenges. These policy debates have to some extent obscured actual practice, both in the United States and abroad.</P><P>In reality, the U.S. federal government has played an integral role in the early development of numerous strategic industries, not only by funding research and development but also through financial support for new companies and government procurement. Telecommunications, aerospace, semiconductors, computers, pharmaceuticals, and nuclear power are among the many industries that were launched and nurtured with federal support.</P><P>The intensifying global race to dominate an array of emerging high-tech industries once again has focused attention on the role of public policy. As China, South Korea, Germany, and Taiwan target industries such as renewable energy equipment, solid-state lighting, electric vehicles, and next-generation displays with comprehensive strategies and generous subsidies, the U.S. has struggled to compete. The financial crisis of 2008 has made it even more difficult for U.S. technology companies to raise the capital needed to turn designs into prototypes and prototypes into products made in large volumes.</P><P>In recent years, the Science, Technology, and Economic Policy Board of the National Academies has extensively studied the competitive challenges facing a number of important high-tech industries. The STEP board also has studied the policies adopted other nations and compared them to those of the United States.</P><P>This chapter explores the major policy issues in four of these industries—semiconductors, photovoltaic products, advanced batteries, and pharmaceuticals. Each of these industries can be regarded as strategic to the United States. Integrated circuits are the building blocks of all electronics products and have enabled the breathtaking advances in information technology that drive productivity gains across all industries. American leadership in semiconductors also is vital to the technological superiority of the U.S. military. Photovoltaic cells are the enabling technology of solar power, a key source of renewable energy that can serve America’s national interests in reducing dependence on petroleum and cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Advanced batteries and their electrical management systems are the core components of hybrid and electric vehicles, much as internal combustion engines have been to conventional gasoline-powered cars and trucks. A strong domestic battery industry, therefore, is regarded as crucial to the future competitiveness of the U.S. auto industry. Lightweight, long-lasting, rechargeable energy-storage systems also are required for advanced weapons systems being developed by the U.S. military and for storing renewable energy for utility power grids. The pharmaceuticals industry is likewise strategic, producing medicines and vaccines that are essential to the well-being of Americans and indeed the world’s people. U.S. leadership in this sector has been secured through enormous federal investments, though the industry faces numerous challenges in terms of litigation, regulatory pressure, and counterfeit drugs.</P><P>Each of these three industries shares another characteristic. The core technologies are the fruits of decades of research at U.S. universities and national laboratories at considerable American taxpayer expense. Many of the early U.S. companies that pioneered these industries, moreover, were supported over the years through federal research grants, small-business loans, and government and military procurement.</P><P>As they reached the point of large-scale commercial production, each of these U.S. industries encountered severe global competitive challenges<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn2"">2</A></SUP>. Concerted Japanese government policies to facilitate joint R&amp;D, transfer commercial technology to companies, protect domestic producers from imports helped Japanese companies in the 1970s and 1980s seize a commanding global market share in dynamic random-access memory chips, sending the U.S. semiconductor industry into crisis. U.S. companies dominated the nascent photovoltaic industry through the 1980s. Leadership in mass production of cells and modules, however, was assumed by Japan in the 1990s—and then Germany, Taiwan, and China—after each of these nations or regions enacted policies to build domestic markets for solar power or to promote manufacturing. The lithium-ion industry is one of several high-tech sectors that grew from U.S.-invented technology but was never industrialized domestically. Instead, Japanese companies were the first to mass-produce rechargeable lithium-ion batteries for electronic devices and notebook computers because of their large-scale production of consumer electronics. South Korean and Chinese manufacturers followed their lead. Asian producers, therefore, have a huge advantage in the small but extremely promising market for rechargeable batteries for cars and trucks.</P><P>The four industries illustrate different aspects of the public policy debate. <B>The U.S. semiconductor industry</B> is a case study in how a strategic sector that had lost competitive advantage in production and a once-dominant market share was able to regain global leadership through cooperation on pre-competitive R&amp;D and public policy initiatives with responsive government actions. The public-private research consortium SEMATECH and assertive U.S. trade policies in response to Japanese dumping and protectionism enabled the industry rebound.</P><P><B>The photovoltaic industry</B> is an example of a U.S. high-tech sector that has lost global share but has a solid opportunity to re-emerge as a leader with the right mix of federal and state policy support. In the case of solar power, a deciding factor will be whether the United States will become a big enough market to support a large-scale, globally competitive manufacturing industry. Federal and state incentives will be essential for the next few years, until the cost of solar energy can compete against electricity generated from fossil fuels without subsidies. Another question is whether U.S. companies that focus on products incorporating promising new technologies will be able to survive surging imports of low-cost photovoltaic cells and modules based on mature technologies long enough to attain economies of scale. What’s more, because technologies are still evolving rapidly, and there are not yet commonly accepted manufacturing standards, the global race for future leadership remains wide open. Public-private research partnerships will be essential to ensure that the U.S. can be a leader in the race for global market share.</P><P>The emerging <B>U.S. advanced battery industry</B> represents a bold experiment by the federal government in direct financial support of private companies to establish a domestic manufacturing industry. Prior to 2008, the U.S. had a number of lithium-ion battery start-ups but virtually no production plants.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn3"">3</A></SUP> It now has dozens of battery-related factories that are beginning to ramp-up, thanks in part to $2.4 billion in grants and support under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Like photovoltaic cells, however, prices of lithium-ion auto batteries are too high, making hybrid and electric vehicles expensive for most consumers compared to conventional gasoline-powered vehicles. Larger demand, in turn, is required for the industry to attain the economies of scale that will bring prices down, in turn generating higher demand. In addition, further <mark>innovation</mark> is required to improve battery performance and reduce cost. Federal policies to support expansion of the market and public-private R&amp;D collaboration will likely be required for the foreseeable future, but the long-term gain to the economy and national security can be significant.</P><P>The ascent of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry has been driven by massive federal support for life sciences R&amp;D, primarily by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). During the decade of 2001, U.S. firms developed 57 “new chemical entities” (NCEs) compared with 33 by European firms and nine by Japanese firms, erasing the European lead which existed in prior decades. Despite the spectacular successes of past two decades, the U.S. pharmaceutical industry’s future prospects are uncertain. Many of the blockbuster drugs that drove the industry’s success have gone off patent or will do so soon, including first-generation biotechnology drugs, and branded producers face growing competitive pressure from generic drug makers. The costs and risks of developing new drugs and bringing them to market are rising, while the productivity of the industry’s R&amp;D appears to be declining. In light of key developments, especially in emerging markets, a key challenge is to sustain the productivity and competitiveness of this strategic U.S. industry.</P><DIV id=""ch6.s1""><H2 id=""_ch6_s1_"">SEMICONDUCTORS</H2><P>A little more than two decades ago, the U.S. semiconductor industry appeared to be going the way of the U.S. consumer electronics industry. Japanese companies had seized a commanding world market share and technological lead in memory devices and were rapidly adding more production capacity. Struggling U.S. chipmakers were abandoning a large segment of the industry that made memory products, an essential part of computers and other leading semiconductor technologies of the eighties. There was widespread concern that erosion of America’s semiconductor industry posed not only economic challenges, but national security risks as well. Even after the U.S. government had begun to mount a strong policy response to bolster U.S. competitiveness, a defense task force warned in 1987 that a dependence on foreign suppliers for state-of-the-art chips for weapons was an “unacceptable situation” because it would undermine the U.S. military strategy of maintaining technological superiority.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn4"">4</A></SUP> This national security concern and the willingness of the semiconductor industry to collectively seek policy help from Washington were instrumental in reversing the loss of market share and technology lead that seemed irretrievably lost.</P><P>Remarkably, as recounted below, the U.S. semiconductor regained global leadership by the early -1990s and —despite the dramatic rise of new competitors in South Korea, Taiwan, and China—remains today a top semiconductor producer. Even though the U.S. market accounts for only 18 percent of the global sales for integrated circuits, sales by U.S. companies accounted for 48 percent of the world market in 2010.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn5"">5</A></SUP> [See <A class=""figpopup"" href=""/books/NBK100307/figure/ch6.f1/?report=objectonly"" target=""object"" rid-figpopup=""figch6f1"" rid-ob=""figobch6f1"">Figure 6.1</A>] While only one U.S. company is still a major player in memory chips, the U.S. semiconductor industry dominates the lucrative market for logic devices such as microprocessors and analog mixed signal products.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn6"">6</A></SUP></P><DIV class=""iconblock whole_rhythm clearfix ten_col fig"" id=""figch6f1"" co-legend-rid=""figlgndch6f1""><DIV class=""icnblk_cntnt"" id=""figlgndch6f1""><H4 id=""ch6.f1""><A href=""/books/NBK100307/figure/ch6.f1/?report=objectonly"" target=""object"" rid-ob=""figobch6f1"">FIGURE 6.1</A></H4><P class=""float-caption no_bottom_margin"">Global market share of U.S. semiconductor companies, 1982–2010.

NOTE: Share data based on nationality of company.</P></DIV></DIV><P>Moreover, despite rapid growth in outsourcing to Asian foundries (wafer fabrication factories that produce integrated circuits on a contract basis for other firms), the vast majority of production and R&amp;D by U.S. semiconductor companies remains in the United States.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn7"">7</A></SUP> Seventy-seven percent of capacity owned by America semiconductor companies is located in U.S. and 74 percent of compensation and benefits is paid to U.S.-based workers.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn8"">8</A></SUP> And while the vast majority of chip companies now outsource fabrication of the devices they design to foundries located in Asia, approximately 500 of the world’s 1,200 so-called “fabless” design firms—including most of the industry leaders—are headquartered in North America.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn9"">9</A></SUP></P><P>This turn of fortunes is primarily due to strategic moves and investments in new technologies by U.S. semiconductor manufacturers. Yet, their success also rests on the important contributions of U.S. policy that was driven by an engaged industry. There were two additional interrelated elements to the U.S. success:<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn10"">10</A></SUP> The research consortium SEMATECH, a $200 million-a-year research effort co-funded by the federal government and most large American chip companies, accelerated productivity and <mark>innovation</mark> in semiconductor manufacturing based on a common technology roadmap and enabled a rapid decline in prices.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn11"">11</A></SUP> Persistent trade negotiations and enforcement of previous agreements won commitments from Japan to open its market to U.S. semiconductors and curtail dumping in any world market.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn12"">12</A></SUP> This was deemed essential to prevent the United States from becoming a high-priced island in a sea of underpriced semiconductors. Had that occurred, it would have severely disadvantaged downstream American electronics equipment producers compared with competitors producing abroad utilizing lower-priced dumped chips.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn13"">13</A></SUP></P><P>The decline and resurgence of the U.S. semiconductor industry offers many useful lessons for policymakers and industrialists grappling with how to bolster other American high-technology sectors facing intense international competitive pressure. It shows that erosion of U.S. leadership in manufacturing is not irreversible as long as both industry and government are committed to cooperative action, both on trade policy and in well-designed research programs that will lead to <mark>innovation</mark>. In a comprehensive analysis of the semiconductor experience, the National Research Council concluded that overcoming competitive challenges requires “continued policy engagement and public investment through renewed attention to basic research and cooperative mechanisms such as public-private partnerships.”<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn14"">14</A></SUP></P><DIV id=""ch6.s2""><H3>The Strategic Importance of Semiconductors</H3><P>The importance of semiconductors to the United States is difficult to overstate. As an industry, the semiconductor sector directly employs over 180,000 Americans and has consistently ranked as either America’s No. 1 or No. 2 export industry.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn15"">15</A></SUP> Semiconductors represent the core technology of the modern electronics revolution, enabling products from smart phones and computers to advanced weapons systems. More importantly, semiconductors have made possible the rapid advances in information technology that drive productivity gains across other industries. As one National Academies study noted—</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>“...often called the ‘crude oil of the information age,’ semiconductors are the basic building blocks of many electronics industries.

By the early 1980s, the U.S. industry was in crisis and reached out to the federal government for help.

In 1982, the semiconductor industry formed and funded the Semiconductor Research Corporation, an independent affiliate of the SIA, to conduct silicon-based research at universities. Two years later, President Ronald Reagan signed the National Cooperative Research Act, which reformed U.S. antitrust law to encourage joint R&amp;D consortia.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn38"">38</A></SUP> The Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corp., a privately funded industry consortium, was established in response to Japan’s government-funded “Fifth Generation” R&amp;D program that aimed to put Japanese computer makers at the leading edge of technology.

At the recommendation of industry and the Defense Science Board, Congress in 1987 voted to match industry contributions for precompetitive research in a non-profit consortium. SEMATECH corporate members consisted of all of the largest device makers at the time, including IBM, Intel, Motorola, Texas Instruments, Hewlett Packard, and National Semiconductor. Former Intel chairman Gordon Moore described the organization as unique in that industry made sure that U.S. companies assigned top people to a public-private partnership.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn40"">40</A></SUP> The strategy was to have SEMATECH focus on fabrication equipment and processes so that semiconductor companies could focus on design, quality, and <mark>innovation</mark>.

An assertive U.S. response to Japanese trade practices that began in the mid-1980s also helped stem and then reverse the decline of the American semiconductor industry. In response to Japanese dumping and protection of its own market,<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn48"">48</A></SUP> the United States and Japan initiated a bilateral working group on high technology in 1983 to address trade conflicts. Two years later, the two nations agreed to completely eliminate tariffs on imported semiconductors. The SIA filed a Section 301 petition alleging that the Japanese government kept out imported chips through non-tariff barriers. In 1986, the U.S. Department of Commerce concluded that Japanese semiconductor firms were selling memory chips in the U.S. market at prices substantially below the cost of production. Together with the injury caused to U.S. industry, this warranted a finding of dumping. The further finding by the U.S. Trade Representative in 1987 that Japan had still not opened it market for foreign products and had breached its antidumping commitment prompted President Ronald Reagan to impose a 100 percent duty on $300 million worth of Japanese goods.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn49"">49</A></SUP></P><P>The two nations reached an unprecedented agreement in 1986 under which Japan pledged that imported chips would account for 20 percent of its domestic market.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn50"">50</A></SUP> The number was chosen because Japan’s integrated producers of semiconductors, who were at the same time large semiconductor consumers, accounted for only 13 percent of Japanese consumption of semiconductors. A 20 percent goal required that Japanese producers and the Japanese government allow access to a customer base beyond the big vertically integrated Japanese producers. Japan also agreed to a “fast-track” approach to resolving dumping allegations. In return, the U.S. dropped anti-dumping duties and its Section 301 case. By late 1992, the Japanese market was open to competitive foreign products, and foreign chips did indeed account for 20.2 percent of Japan’s market.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn51"">51</A></SUP></P><P>The series of U.S. Japan Semiconductor Agreements “was a pivotal point in the recovery of the U.S. semiconductor industry and its return to global leadership,” said Semiconductor Industry Association President George M. Scalise.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn52"">52</A></SUP> Antidumping cases provided a means for companies like Intel to stay in the production of erasable programmable read only memories (EPROMS), which allowed it to progress to the production of flash memory. The U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreements also enabled Texas Instruments and Micron Technologies to stay in the DRAM business and gave South Korea and Taiwan an opportunity to enter the memory market. Creation of a competitive multiple vendor base, in turn, spurred the production of ever more powerful personal and mainframe computers at diminishing cost and fueled the information technology revolution. Also, the agreements allowed Intel and other companies to pursue more attractive opportunities in devices such as microprocessors.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn53"">53</A></SUP> The trade pacts with Japan are widely credited with giving the U.S. and foreign industries breathing room to adjust and regain the profitability needed to invest in advanced capacity and new technologies.

In 2007, Intel agreed to build a 300 mm wafer fab in the coastal city of Dalian for chip sets. China’s glut in capacity also means that it is in a strong position to gain substantial share in chips and other silicon-based devices that do not require the most advanced technology, such as photovoltaic cells and light-emitting diode chips for solid-state lighting.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn84"">84</A></SUP></P><P>Asia will likely remain the largest market for leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Because process R&amp;D and wafer fabrication are closely linked, moreover, the continued erosion of U.S. market share in wafer fabrication capacity could eventually give the technological advantage to nations that are investing more aggressively in state-of-the-art capacity.

Germany and other governments offer direct grants, project equipment, and central and state government loans and loan guarantees to semiconductor manufacturers. The German federal government and the state of Saxony, for example, covered the total construction cost of AMD’s “Fab 36” to produce 45nm and 65nm 300mm wafers in Dresden in 2004.

Three-quarters of what American chip companies invest in R&amp;D is spent in the U.S. America’s continued dominance of semiconductor design cannot be taken for granted, however. The chip-design industries in Taiwan, India, and China have grown tremendously, either as outsourcing destinations or as development bases for domestic industries. The share of research by U.S. companies performed in the United States declined from 86.2 percent in 1997–99 to 77.8 percent in 2005–2007, according to the SIA.

By outsourcing manufacturing to large foundries, even small chip companies can gain access to state-of-the-art wafers and production processes without having to raise the billions of dollars required to build their own modern production capacity. Instead, they can focus their resources on design around standardized parameters. What’s more, major foundries offer “IP libraries” so that companies with only specialized proprietary designs can develop entire “systems on a chip.”<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn93"">93</A></SUP> As a result, the industry has been undergoing a process that D.

A number of governments are targeting semiconductor design and development for rapid development. India, already a major R&amp;D base for companies such as Intel and Texas Instruments, has a plan to increase the nation’s share of the very large integrated-circuit market from 0.5 percent to 5 percent and to boost annual revenue to $1 billion.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn97"">97</A></SUP> The India Semiconductor Association predicts that annual revenue of India’s semiconductor development industry will grow from $7.5 billion in 2010 to $10.6 billion in 2012.

Multinationals such as Intel and Freescale have opened Chinese design centers and a number of fabless design companies have opened in Shanghai and Beijing. China’s lack of intellectual property protection, however, has prevented the country from attracting more foreign investment. In an SIA survey of U.S. chip companies, a majority indicated they would not locate their most advanced and critical R&amp;D activities in China, “despite encouragement and even pressure by the government to do so, and regardless of the availability, quality and size of incentives, due to concerns about the inadequacy of intellectual property protection.”<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn102"">102</A></SUP> If China follows through on commitments to protect intellectual property, however, the fact that it has the fastest growing market for semiconductors indicates that it has enormous potential to grow in chip R&amp;D.</P></DIV><DIV id=""ch6.s11""><H4>Workforce Issues</H4><P>Perhaps the biggest threat to long-term U.S. leadership in semiconductor R&amp;D is availability of talent.

The latter technology uses mirrors or lenses to concentrate solar thermal energy onto a small area. Solar thermal plants transfer the heat from concentrated sunlight into a hot working fluid, which powers a generator that produces electricity. Concentrated photovoltaic systems concentrate sunlight onto a small, highly efficient PV semiconductor device. Because mirrors or lenses can only concentrate an image of the sun, their use tends to be limited to cloudless regions with abundant, direct sunlight, such as deserts in the U.S. Southwest.</P><P>Flat plates are the far more widely used. The most common photovoltaic cells use polycrystalline materials to absorb and release photons that then are converted into electrical current. Polycrystalline cells, which account for 90 percent of the market, typically are laminated on large glass panels. Because their weight and rigidity, panels with polycrystalline cells tend to be manufactured close to the end market, and installation accounts for around half of the system cost. The other main type of photovoltaic cells use materials such as cadmium telluride or gallium arsenide to absorb light that are deposited in ultra-thin layers on more flexible materials, such as thin sheets of metal or polymers. Thin-film cells on the market yield less power, but are far lighter and easier to install than rigid polycrystalline cells, so their overall cost can be lower.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn168"">168</A></SUP> Thin-film is expected to rise from around 50 megawatts of generating capacity installed in 2007 to around 4.5 GW (gigawatts) by 2012.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn169"">169</A></SUP> Other competing technologies, such as dye-sensitized and nano-particle photovoltaics, are at an early stage of development.

Companies, therefore, are likely to continue building capacity in nations where they are installed. The best way for the U.S. to regain leadership role in photovoltaic manufacturing is to become a market leader in installations, according to several industry experts. “Manufacturing will occur in the U.S. once we have adequate markets,” said Ken Zweibel of the George Washington Solar Institute.”<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn212"">212</A></SUP> First solar CEO Michael J.

Bob Street of the Palo Alto Research Center drew a parallel with the flat-panel display industry. The U.S. pioneered many of the early technologies for liquid-crystal displays, but the industry ended up being dominated by Japanese, South Korean, and Taiwanese companies. As U.S. plants closed, the substantial ecosystem of local equipment manufacturers, materials suppliers, and technology developers went with them, Mr. Street explained. Because flexible photovoltaic technology also requires large, capital-intensive plants and similar clean-room production expertise used in new displays, Mr. Street warned that well-capitalized Asian companies are in position to take over the industry when the market is ripe.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn215"">215</A></SUP></P></DIV><DIV id=""ch6.s22""><H4>Intense Global Competition</H4><P>The competition over 21<SUP>st</SUP> century leadership in photovoltaic technology and manufacturing is intense.

Indeed, the U.S. Department of Energy estimates that Germany spends €4.6 billion on support for all kinds of renewable energies a year, equal to 0.2 percent of GDP. If the U.S. government devoted a similar share of GDP to renewable energy, it would invest $29 billion a year.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn220"">220</A></SUP></P><P>Germany has been nurturing regional photovoltaic industrial clusters for the past two decades.

Through the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Science and Technology, and the National Energy Administration, projects receive cash subsidies to cover 50 percent of investment in commercial buildings, 50 percent for large-scale photovoltaic systems connected to the power grid, and 70 percent of costs for remote rural residential buildings. In addition, the cost of power is subsidized.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn223"">223</A></SUP> The Golden Sun subsidy “is so large that it is virtually certain to increase the demand for solar power generation equipment,” according to a National Foreign Trade Council analysis.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn224"">224</A></SUP> As of mid-2011, 294 projects had been approved. In addition to these subsidies, feed-in tariff programs have been implemented in districts of Shanghai, Inner Mongolia and Gansu Province.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn225"">225</A></SUP></P><P>China also offers many forms of support to photovoltaic manufacturers. For example, producers can access cash grants of between ¥200,000 and ¥300,000 ($30,900 to $46,300) available to high-tech startups that are less than three years old with no more than 3,000 employees. Large “demonstration projects” by manufacturers get grants of up to ¥1 million. The China Development Bank, meanwhile, offers low-interest loans of several billion dollars for major production plants. The bank reportedly provided $30 billion in low-cost loans to photovoltaic manufacturers in 2010.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn226"">226</A></SUP> A number of Chinese provinces offer further incentives, including refunds for interest on loans and electricity costs, 10-year tax holidays, loan guarantees, and refunds of value-added taxes.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn227"">227</A></SUP> To open its production plant in China, Massachusetts-based Evergreen Solar was reported to have received $21 million in cash grants, a $15 million property tax break, a subsidized lease worth $2.7 million, and $13 million worth of infrastructure such as roads.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn228"">228</A></SUP></P><P>Such subsidies have spurred massive expansion of production capacity. By the first half of 2009, some 50 Chinese companies were constructing, expanding or preparing polycrystalline silicon production lines. Capacity for 2010 was forecast rise from 60,000 tons to more than 140,000 tons, even though much of that capacity is not being utilized.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn229"">229</A></SUP></P><P>China’s domestic photovoltaic industry has another major advantage in that government procurement rules require that products required for “government investment projects” be purchased from domestic sources unless they are unavailable.

The most common measure is the feed-in tariff, a subsidy scheme under which utilities are compelled to purchase power generated by solar installations at a specified rate. The added costs generally are passed on to rate-payers or absorbed by the government. The United States introduced the first feed-in tariffs for renewable energy in 1978.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn243"">243</A></SUP> Germany introduced feed-in tariffs in 1990. While these early experiments led to some installation of wind turbines, they were not very successful in advancing solar power. The big boost came when Germany revised its feed-in tariffs in 2000 under the Renewable Energy Sources Act.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn244"">244</A></SUP> The prices utilities paid were based on the cost of generating power for each renewable source, depending on the size of the project, plus a profit margin. Purchase guarantees were good for 20 years. Utilities were allowed to generate their own renewable energy. Italy, France, Spain, the Czech Republic, Japan, the United Kingdom, Greece, and the Canadian province of Ontario followed with their own feed-in tariffs.</P><P>Feed-in tariffs are popular with the financial community because the rate of return on a solar power system is guaranteed. This largely explains why Europe accounted for two-thirds of installed capacity in 2009, while the U.S., which lacks federal feed-in tariffs, had a small share, explained First Solar CEO Ahearn.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn245"">245</A></SUP> Another advantage of the German feed-in tariffs system, noted Lee Minh of the Department of Energy, is that the purchase-agreement process and incentive structure are far simpler and more stable than in the U.S., which has a mix of subsidies that vary from state to state.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn246"">246</A></SUP></P><P>High electricity prices cannot be borne indefinitely by industry and consumers, however. Therefore, the ideal feed-in tariff program triggers rapid expansion of supply, enabling manufacturers and installers to attain economies of scale and to lower prices. Tariff rates must be adjusted frequently as the prices of photovoltaic modules and installation decline. If subsidies—and investor profits—are too high, then investors rush to build as much capacity as possible, straining government budgets. Also, high tariffs can reduce motivation to find innovative ways to lower costs.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn247"">247</A></SUP></P><P>Germany’s experience with feed-in tariffs illustrates the benefits and risks of the system. Between 2003 and 2009, Germany spent €4.26 billion for feed-in tariffs.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn248"">248</A></SUP> The program was so popular that it triggered rapid expansion in the global industry, causing prices to drop sharply as manufacturers added scale. The program also helped establish a globally competitive manufacturing industry. Germany has 70 manufacturers of silicon, wafers, solar cells, and modules that registered more than €9.5 billion in sales in 2008. Germany also has 100 photovoltaic equipment manufacturers with €2.4 billion in 2008 sales. The photovoltaic manufacturing sector employs more than 57,000 people.</P><P>One downside of German feed-in tariffs is that consumers pay much more for electricity than in the United States. German households paid an average of around 35.5 cents per kilowatt-hour for electricity as of January 2011, nearly twice as much as British households<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn249"">249</A></SUP> and an average of just 11.2 cents in the U.S.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn250"">250</A></SUP> Also, the photovoltaic industry tends to go from boom to bust. When tariffs are high compared to the cost of building capacity, developers race to build solar power systems. Tariffs for solar power ranged from 41 cents to 51 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2009. In 2010 alone, a record 7.1 gigawatts of capacity was installed. When tariffs drop, however, so does investment.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn251"">251</A></SUP> Germany is reducing tariff rates sharply. Nations such as Spain, Italy, France, and the Czech Republic also reduced feed-in tariffs, enacted moratoriums on new connections, or set limits on new capacity. As a result, global growth in the industry slowed dramatically in flagship nations like Germany and Spain in 2011.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn252"">252</A></SUP></P><P>While the U.S. federal government does not offer feed-in tariffs, many states do. Such tariffs have been enacted in California, Maine, and New Hampshire, and have been proposed in Washington, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Florida, New York, Indiana, and Illinois. In addition, 29 U.S. states have set renewable portfolio standards, with 16 of them requiring solar.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn253"">253</A></SUP> Such state programs are lowering costs of installing solar power systems, but one downside is that the wide variety of federal and state incentives makes investment processes very complex.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn254"">254</A></SUP></P></DIV><DIV id=""ch6.s24""><H4>Technological Challenges</H4><P>Some industry experts maintain that another technological leap in materials and processes is required before solar power can become cost-competitive with <mark>carbon</mark>-emitting energy. John Kelly of IBM contended that incremental improvements, such as better production equipment or modules built from larger sheets of glass, won’t boost energy output of photovoltaic panels fast enough to meet current implementation targets for solar power. The cost gap “has to be closed by leaps of technology,” says Mr. Kelly. Nor can the U.S. remain competitive in manufacturing just by investing in more automation. “You have to innovate faster than anyone else,” he said.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn255"">255</A></SUP></P><P>Dramatically improving thin-film photovoltaic technology presents particularly hard challenges. In addition to inventing new substrates, for example, thin-film panels require a flexible, durable, protective front that keeps out moisture as effectively as glass. “From a polymer perspective, this is essentially unheard of,” explained Steven C. Freilich of E. I du Pont de Nemours Co. Freilich of du Pont. Breakthroughs can only be achieved through substantial investments and cooperative research in “radical new materials and processes,” he said.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn256"">256</A></SUP></P><P>Research to develop new materials that then can be produced in mass volume is expensive and risky, however. The challenge is made even more difficult by that fact that there are few widely accepted standards for materials and production processes. Unlike integrated circuits, most of which have been based on complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology for decades and are made from silicon wafers with defined parameters, the photovoltaic market is not yet well defined. John Lushetsky of the DoE compared the two industries in this way: “Put simply, the IC industry is one materials set with an infinite number of circuits; the PV industry is one circuit with an infinite number of materials.”<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn257"">257</A></SUP> There is a mix of large and small photovoltaic companies operating in different markets with different manufacturing targets.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn258"">258</A></SUP> Photovoltaic cells also are used in a wide range of formats. Nor does the industry have a well-defined technology roadmap delineating engineering benchmarks well into the future.</P><P>The inability to predict the technological direction of photovoltaic cells and the lack of widely accepted standards hampers efficiency in the industry and drives up cost and can result in uneven quality, according to Eric Peeters of BP Solar.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn259"">259</A></SUP> It also makes it difficult for materials companies to decide where to make expensive long-term R&amp;D bets, Mr. Freilich of DuPont said. Among other materials used in the industry, DuPont makes polymers for coatings for roll-to-roll processing of thin-sheet modules only 20 nm thick “From a material supplier’s standpoint, there can be a disincentive to do truly revolutionary work when you see this rapid change in markets and technologies,” Mr. Freilich said. “We can do it, but the investment is so great, and the rate of return so dependent on the longevity of the technologies, that you’re not going to see the kind of <mark>innovation</mark> you need.”</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""ch6.s25""><H3>Photovoltaic Policy Questions for the United States</H3><P>The United States has an opportunity to reassert global leadership in the photovoltaic industry. It will require considerable national investment and public-private collaboration.

There was wide agreement among STEP Board symposium participants that federal incentives are necessary to promote the industry until the time when the costs of solar-power systems drop to the point where they can compete on their own with electrical generation from fossil fuels. Although technological advances are needed to bring down costs, so is greater domestic scale. Public commitment to continuing the expansion of solar power also is important to assure companies that are making long-term investments in research, new materials, and manufacturing capacity. “Government incentives that build market size and industry support can help industry make the right decision about programs on one side or another of that very gray line,”<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn261"">261</A></SUP> Mr. Freilich of DuPont said.</P><P>There also is considerable agreement in the photovoltaic industry that, like most other industrial and industrializing nations, the U.S. should consider requiring utilities to purchase solar power and other renewable energy. A number of states, such as California, are pushing ahead with feed-in tariff requirements, meaning that the incentive structure varies from state to state. The question is whether there will be sufficient political support for a German-style feed-in tariff requiring utilities to buy solar power at premium prices if that leads to substantially higher electricity rates for businesses and consumers. The more likely option is that the U.S. continues to stimulate the solar industry’s expansion through a combination of tax incentives, loan guarantees, and other measures.</P></DIV><DIV id=""ch6.s27""><H4>Promoting Manufacturing</H4><P>Although a number of industry experts stress that the best way to promote a domestic photovoltaic manufacturing industry is to stimulate domestic demand, public incentives also are regarded as necessary given the intense global competition for large-scale production capacity. The tax difference along between the U.S. and Asia is such that were a company to move 20 percent of its photovoltaic production to the U.S. its profitability would drop by 14 percent, estimated Steve O’Rourke of Deutsche Bank Securities.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn262"">262</A></SUP> In nations such as China and Germany, manufacturers receive tax credits rather than pay taxes, he noted. Malaysia, which has an ambitious goal to become the second largest solar producer in the world by 2020, provides a 15-year tax holiday for solar manufacturing profits.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn263"">263</A></SUP></P><P>It will be difficult, and probably unnecessary, for the U.S. to match the kinds of generous concessions to manufacturers offered in nations such as China. The U.S. can close the competitiveness gap, however, with a combination of federal and state support. Steven O’Rourke of DeutscheBank Securities estimated that a modest drop in U.S. tax rates, a 27-cent-per-watt manufacturing credit for equipment produced in the U.S., and a subsidy for capital spending, such as offered by Germany, would essentially close the profitability gap.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn264"">264</A></SUP> Accelerated depreciation and state incentives also can make a difference, he said.</P><P>Another issue is financing where major unmet needs exist. The normal timeframe for venture capital investments of 5 to 7 years is not applicable to complex and capital intensive energy technologies subject to a long regulatory approval process. Although the U.S. accounts for most of the world’s venture capital and private-equity investment in the photovoltaic sector, it is much harder for such companies to borrow funds. SBIR loan levels are completely inadequate. Of the $44 billion in debt financing provided to the solar industry around the world in 2010, the U.S. accounted for only 9 percent.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn265"">265</A></SUP> Mark Pinto of Applied Materials suggested that the U.S. create a clean-energy bank that offers low interest rates.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn266"">266</A></SUP> First Solar CEO Ahearn said it would be preferable to making loans available to all photovoltaic manufacturers rather than have the Department of Energy decide which applicants receive loan guarantees, a process that he said had little visibility. “I think we’d be much better off if the government simply enabled all banks to make loans that the market would direct to the right place,” Mr. Ahearn said.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn267"">267</A></SUP></P><P>Several U.S. regions are working to develop strong photovoltaic manufacturing clusters.

Manufacturing, however, has tended to move to other U.S. regions or overseas.

Because the industry is still young and highly fragmented, there are many competing technologies and a lack of manufacturing standards. “There are dozens of groups and subgroups within the PV industry,” according to a report by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. “This diversity makes the development of any industry-wide consensus, such as manufacturing standards, extremely difficult.” Because there are so many evolving technologies, there is good reason for companies to be protective of their intellectual property, the report added. “As a result, companies are less likely to participate in forums that could expose their proprietary information.”<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn273"">273</A></SUP> As a result, research collaborations tend to be on narrowly focused topics that meet the interests of companies funding the research.</P><P>Several industry executives questioned whether a SEMATECH -like research consortium would work for the photovoltaic industry. Doug Rose of SunPower noted that because CMOS already had become standard at the time SEMATECH was created, semiconductor manufacturers could share intellectual property that accelerated development of manufacturing processes on a predictable schedule and instead differentiate themselves on the basis of chip design. “There’s no analog to that in PV,” he said.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn274"">274</A></SUP> Mr. Pinto of Applied Materials agreed that the lack of an established common technology make such collaboration problematic. <SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn275"">275</A></SUP></P><P>Still, industry experts say there are many other opportunities for pre-competitive research collaboration among manufacturers.

As European nations reduce feed-in tariffs, the U.S. has become one of the strongest growth markets for new solar capacity. The U.S. also remains at or near the forefront in photovoltaic research, and therefore could be the source of game-changing breakthroughs that lower the cost of solar power and dramatically improve efficiency.</P><P>Maintaining this momentum, however, will require consistent and substantial public financial support at a time of intense budget pressure. Expanding the U.S. market for solar power is essential to achieving the economies of scale needed to reduce production and installation costs of photovoltaic systems and to assure that the U.S. has a competitive manufacturing base in the face of intensifying international competition. Because solar power is not yet cost-competitive with electricity generated from fossil fuels, continued subsidies for solar-power installations are required. Given the scale, complexity, and long time frames needed for <mark>innovation</mark> solar technologies to come to market, public assistance, such as loan guarantees, early-stage capital, and R&amp;D and manufacturing tax credits also will be required to enable fledgling U.S. photovoltaic companies to bring their products to market and establish domestic production at a time when Asian and European governments are increasing their aid to domestic manufacturers.</P><P>In this regard, public-private research collaboration can help accelerate the pace of photovoltaic <mark>innovation</mark> and reduce the costs and risks of developing the materials and production processes needed to make possible the widespread deployment of solar power.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""ch6.s30""><H2 id=""_ch6_s30_"">ADVANCED BATTERIES</H2><P>American researchers have long been at the technological forefront of lithium-ion batteries,<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn281"">281</A></SUP> which produce electrical charges by lithium ions that flow inside a liquid electrolyte mixture between anode and a cathode plates.

There were many promising U.S. start-ups with innovative lithium-ion battery technology for cars, utility storage, and other uses, but few could raise funds to build capacity in America.</P><P>That situation began to change dramatically in 2009. The federal government awarded $2.4 billion in grants under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to dozens of makers of lithium-ion cells, battery packs, and materials.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn286"">286</A></SUP> A host of other state and federal financial incentives, such as manufacturing tax credits and research grants, provided further assistance.

Advanced batteries are the enabling technology for electrified vehicles. The transportation sector accounts for two-thirds of U.S. petroleum consumption. The 240 million vehicles on U.S. roads, in turn, consume two-thirds of fuel used for transportation.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn295"">295</A></SUP> Utilities also require advanced batteries for storing energy generated by solar farms and wind turbines.</P><P>The U.S. military regards advanced batteries as important as well. Lightweight, rechargeable batteries could greatly extend the range of combat vehicles, support the ever-growing energy needs of modern weapons and surveillance systems, and ease the logistical challenges of hauling fuel to battle zones on long convoys of trucks. Such batteries would considerably lighten the heavy loads of equipment carried by soldiers in the field.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn296"">296</A></SUP> The U.S., which has one of the world’s largest military vehicle fleets, has committed to cutting its fuel consumption by 20 percent in the next 10 to 15 years.</P><P>A domestic advanced battery industry also is strategically important for the future global competitiveness of America’s automotive industry.

For example, South Korea’s LG Chem, the world’s third-largest producer of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, is backed by the $113 billion LG Group. Having such deep pockets is important “to survive in this industry,” explained Mohamed Alamgir, CEO of Compact Power, a U.S. unit of LG Chem. The Korean company plans to invest $1 billion over five years in battery R&amp;D. Due to the LG Group’s chemical businesses, LG Chem also has proprietary materials and processes. LG Chem supplies lithium-ion cells to both Ford and GM is and is building a $151 million complex in Michigan that will produce enough cells to make 50,000 vehicle batteries.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn302"">302</A></SUP></P><P>Perhaps more importantly, demand for electrified vehicles has been stronger outside of the United States. Higher fuel prices in Europe and Japan, for example, make hybrids and plug-ins more affordable alternatives. Other nations have moved more aggressively to develop their domestic markets for electrified vehicles with subsidies, government vehicle purchases, and investments in public battery-charging infrastructure.

American companies, universities, and national laboratories remain leading innovators of new lithium-ion chemistries, and the coatings and materials used in cathodes and anodes, which are more suitable to the demanding needs of automakers and the military. The U.S. supply chain is growing; a Duke University study identified at least 50 U.S.-based firms that manufacture or conduct R&amp;D at 119 locations in 27 states, including 21 lithium-ion battery pack makers relevant to the auto industry.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn325"">325</A></SUP> Many are increasing the capabilities to manufacture cells domestically. Dow, A123, and EnerDel acquired or formed strategic partnerships with South Korean manufacturers. While U.S. producers still must import most cathodes and anodes, there are several large American suppliers of electrolytes, separators, and lithium. Companies such as 3M, DuPont, and Dow Kokam, meanwhile, have created divisions to domestically produce anodes and cathodes.</P><P>Another cause for optimism is that the advanced battery industry for vehicles is still young and technological standards have not yet been established—leaving room for new entrants. Most analysts predict it will be at least five years before the costs and performance of battery-powered cars reach levels at which they will attain widespread consumer appeal. Pike Research, for instance, predicts hybrid and plug-in electrics will account for only 2 to 3 percent of the U.S. market in 2015 and 5 percent in 2020.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn326"">326</A></SUP> Although Ford Motor plans to offer a full portfolio of hybrid and plug-in cars and trucks, it projects it will take at least 15 years for electrified vehicles to account for 25 percent of sales.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn327"">327</A></SUP></P><P>Industry experts also believe lithium-ion batteries will have to go through several more generations of technology and manufacturing improvements before they are affordable, efficient, and light enough to win wide consumer acceptance for electric cars.

A general industry assumption is that those costs should drop nearly two-thirds to make such cars affordable enough to convince consumers to abandon gasoline-powered cars.

A high Army priority is to fit combat vehicles with Silent Watch capability, enabling them to operate essential systems while stationary without running the engine. Future light tactical vehicles will require 40 kilowatts of power, compared to 10 kilowatts now, according to Grace Bochenek of TARDEC. Future ground combat systems will need nearly 50 kilowatts. Cost reduction also is critical. Although current lithium-ion battery packs for light tactical vehicles weigh one-third as much as advanced lead-acid batteries and produce 50 percent more power, they cost nearly 20 times as much—around $10,000 each.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn345"">345</A></SUP></P><P>Other branches of the military also have an interest in advanced batteries. The Air Force is developing hybrid systems for unmanned aerial vehicles that operate 40 to 50 hours and need thousands of watts of power, for example. The U.S. Navy is looking to use hybrids for unmanned underwater vehicles, shallow-water combat submersibles, submarine distributed power systems, and surface ship fuel economy. In each scenario for reducing energy use, “batteries run rampant throughout them in almost every capacity,” explained John Pellegrino of the Army Research Laboratory.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn346"">346</A></SUP></P><P>Collaboration with industry and academia is essential if the Army is to achieve its targets. Sharp cost reductions of domestically produced batteries can only be achieved with high-volume production, noted Dr. Pellegrino. Therefore, the Army is forming major partnerships with the private sector and collaborating earlier with industry to make sure new devices are manufacturable. “We don’t want each of those vehicles to cost $1 billion,” Dr. Pellegrino said.</P></DIV><DIV id=""ch6.s34""><H3>Future Policy Priorities</H3><P>Now that the U.S. has established a manufacturing base for advanced batteries, policymakers face a new set of challenges to make this nascent industry <mark>sustainable</mark> and globally competitive. If U.S.-based manufacturers cannot survive, the implications for American competitiveness in next-generation vehicles may be severe. “While the risk of overcapacity is very real for U.S. firms,” warns the Duke University study, “it may actually pale in comparison to the opposite risk: that of not being prepared to lead this new industry, with serious implications for the U.S. edge in the global automotive sector.”<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn347"">347</A></SUP></P><P>The following are several of the key policy issues identified by industry experts—</P><P><B>Accelerate R&amp;D</B>: Not all analysts agree on what kind of battery performance will be required for electrified vehicles to win wide consumer acceptance. Research by the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California at Davis, for example, suggests that drivers of plug-in hybrids adapt to limited driving ranges and battery recharging needs the more they drive their cars.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn348"">348</A></SUP> Other analysts, however, contend that battery cost and performance are not improving fast enough.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn349"">349</A></SUP></P><P>There is general agreement in the industry that the federal government should increase battery R&amp;D through public-private partnerships in order to accelerate advances that will make electrified vehicles viable alternatives to gas-powered cars for the mass market in the near future. Experts also stressed that it is important to increase R&amp;D funding for research into technologies beyond lithium-ion (such as hydrogen fuel cells) that can yield breakthroughs. GM estimates alternative technologies could be commercially viable by 2016.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn350"">350</A></SUP></P><P><B>Government Purchases</B>: Large-scale production is the surest way of bringing down the costs of advanced battery cells and packs. Government purchases of advanced batteries from U.S. based manufacturers can help the domestic industry to attain economies of scale. A number of industry executives and experts recommend the U.S. government to take stronger action to help stimulate demand enough to launch the industry, as are governments in Asia and Europe. The federal policy priority should shift to “demand-driven stimulation rather than stimulating manufacturing and research,” said Les Alexander, A123’s general manager for government solutions. “We can create the best battery in the world, but without vehicles to put them in, this industry will go back overseas and we will have stimulated another country’s industries,” he said.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn351"">351</A></SUP> It is important to note that increased sales of electric vehicles in the U.S. will not necessarily result in increased sales of U.S. made advanced batteries.</P><P>Government purchases of electrified vehicles are one policy option. Several experts noted that the federal government could help create a substantial market by purchasing U.S.-made hybrid and plug-in electric cars and trucks to replenish the fleet of some 700,000 vehicles owned by the military and agencies such as the U.S. Postal Service. The Advanced Vehicle and Power Initiative, a program backed by TARDEC, calls for replacing 8 percent of the government truck fleet annually with electrified vehicles.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn352"">352</A></SUP></P><P>The General Services Administration recently announced a goal to buy more than 40,000 alternative-fuel and fuel-efficient vehicles to replace aging and less-efficient sedans, trucks, tankers, and wreckers across federal agencies. <SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn353"">353</A></SUP> Such programs may need to be increased and implemented over a longer term. Michael E. Reed of Magna E-Car Systems noted that manufacturers make investments based on a five- to seven-year time horizon.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn354"">354</A></SUP></P><P><B>Improve Incentives:</B> Federal incentives such as consumer tax credits for purchases of electrified vehicles will likely be required for several more years before the U.S. market is large enough to support fledgling advanced-battery manufacturers.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn355"">355</A></SUP> Several industry experts suggested the life of such programs be extended.</P><P>Current incentive programs also can be improved. Under the current incentive program, for examples, buyers of plug-in hybrids receive a $7,500 credit that they can apply the following year on their income tax return. Such an incentive program would have a more immediate impact if consumers could receive the credit at the time they complete the purchase of the car.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn356"">356</A></SUP> Some experts also recommend extending more federal incentives to purchasers of hybrid and plug-in commercial trucks.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn357"">357</A></SUP></P><P><B>Public Charging Infrastructure.</B> There is general agreement among experts that some level of public charging infrastructure is needed to ease so-called “range anxiety” by drivers who fear they will be stranded if their electric car batteries run out of power. Several countries have made nationwide public-charging networks a top priority.</P><P>There is disagreement over how extensive such charging infrastructure must be. Research by the Institute of Transportation Studies, for instance, suggests that most drivers of electric cars do not use public charging stations, and rarely use them at work. Instead, they prefer to charge their cars overnight at home.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn358"">358</A></SUP> Executives from GM and Ford agreed that public infrastructure is a lower priority than providing affordable battery-charging systems for homes, with charging stations at work sites a next priority. Home chargers for small, basic plug-in hybrids can be installed for less than $200, but units for all-battery electric cars cost around $2,000. Workplace or public stations can cost $50,000 each.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn359"">359</A></SUP> Several experts suggested that policy should focus on R&amp;D aimed at bringing down the costs of home and workplace charging units.</P><P><B>Developing the Value Chain</B>: Developing a more extensive domestic supply base for advanced batteries also is required to make the U.S. industry globally competitive. Although some companies are investing in U.S. plants to make materials and key components, several industry executives describe the efforts as inadequate. In addition to cathodes, anodes, and separators, according to Johnson Controls executive Mr. Watson, most software and mechanical components must be imported.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn360"">360</A></SUP> Nor is there a sufficient domestic supply base for key components used in electrified cars. Mr. Reed of Magna E-Car explained that the complexity of the supply chain “adds significant cost” to U.S.-based manufacturing and is time-consuming.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn361"">361</A></SUP> The impressive investment in North American lithium-ion cell production since 2008 has not “been balanced by necessary investment in the supply chain itself,” he observed.</P></DIV><DIV id=""ch6.s35""><H3>Conclusion</H3><P>The emerging U.S. advanced battery industry represents a bold experiment by the federal government in direct financial support of private companies to establish a domestic manufacturing industry. Prior to 2008, the U.S. had a number of lithium-ion battery start-ups but virtually no production plants. It now has dozens of battery-related factories, thanks in part to $2.4 billion in aid under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, making it an active competitor in the advanced vehicle battery industry.</P><P>The major question is whether the U.S. will be able to sustain the policy support needed for the nascent advanced battery industry through what are expended to be challenging years ahead. Most experts predict it will be at least five years before a combination of technological improvements and higher production volumes will bring costs of lithium-ion car batteries—and therefore the prices of hybrid and electric vehicles—to the point that they can compete with gas-powered vehicles in the market. There also is some doubt whether demand will be big enough to justify the battery-manufacturing capacity that is coming online.</P><P>Continued federal incentives to promote consumer purchases of hybrid and electric cars and perhaps greater public procurement—as other nations are doing--will likely be essential to make the U.S. battery industry viable. Continued federal and state support for public-private research collaborations also will be required to accelerate the advances in technology and manufacturing processes needed to bring the cost of rechargeable car batteries down to the point where electrified vehicles can compete on their own with gasoline-powered vehicles.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""ch6.s36""><H2 id=""_ch6_s36_"">PHARMACEUTICALS AND BIOPHARMACEUTICALS</H2><P>The U.S. pharmaceutical industry produces medicines through chemical synthesis and biological processes (biopharmaceuticals). Historically the industry has lagged behind the European pharmaceutical sector in <mark>innovation</mark>, but the phenomenal growth of the U.S. biotechnology industry after the late 1970s catapulted the U.S. into a clear leadership position in the development of new and innovative drugs. The ascent of the U.S. industry has been driven by massive federal support for life sciences R&amp;D, primarily by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In addition, the implementation of federal legislation and regulatory policies designed to foster <mark>innovation</mark> in the 1980s — most notably the enactment of the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, which enabled universities to own intellectual property rights for technologies they developed through federal funding — enabled a burst of innovative entrepreneurial activity in biotechnology. During the decade of 2001, U.S. firms developed 57 “new chemical entities” (NCEs) compared with 33 by European firms and nine by Japanese firms, erasing the European lead which existed in prior decades.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn362"">362</A></SUP></P><P>Despite the spectacular successes of the past two decades, the U.S. pharmaceutical industry’s future prospects are uncertain. Many of the blockbuster drugs that drove the industry’s success have gone off patent or will do so soon, including first-generation biotechnology drugs, and branded producers face growing competitive pressure from generic drug makers. The costs and risks of developing new drugs and bringing them to market are rising, while the productivity of the industry’s R&amp;D appears to be declining. Current research spending by the industry and by NIH is stagnant. The industry faces numerous growing risks, including various kinds of high stakes litigation, regulatory pressure, counterfeit drugs, and the hazards of operating in sometimes disorderly emerging markets, where the industry sees its best growth prospects.</P><DIV id=""ch6.s37""><H3>Strategic importance</H3><P>The pharmaceutical industry produces medicines and vaccines that are essential to the well-being of the U.S. population. Pharmaceuticals ward off epidemics, treat cancer, and cure diseases. The availability of medicine to treat wounded military personnel drastically reduces the death rate from infections in wartime. The history of conflict in the Twentieth Century demonstrates the vulnerability of countries that lack the capability to produce medicine.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn363"">363</A></SUP> The ability of U.S. forces to wage war in the Pacific during World War II was strengthened by the development of synthetic alternatives to the anti-malarial quinine, the principal sources of which were controlled by Japan.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn364"">364</A></SUP></P></DIV><DIV id=""ch6.s38""><H3>Evolution of the Industry</H3><P>The modern pharmaceutical industry is descended from small apothecary shops, principally in Germany, which began systematic production of drugs in the mid and late Nineteenth Century.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn365"">365</A></SUP> In the United States, during the same era the principal drug companies were wholesaler/producers offering a full line of drugs, many of which were imported from Germany. The embargo of German goods during World War I compelled these companies to enhance their own technical ability to make refinements on existing drug technologies and to develop new drugs.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn366"">366</A></SUP> While some sophisticated technological centers devoted to pharmaceutical science arose in the U.S., the European industry led in new drug development through most of the Twentieth Century, and as recently as 1980 eight of the top ten drugs were discovered in Europe.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn367"">367</A></SUP></P><P>Economic historian Alfred Chandler observes that during the first quarter of the Twentieth Century a relatively small number of European and American companies developed internal organizational structures permitting the use of science for the systematic discovery, manufacture and commercialization of new drugs. Most current industry leaders trace their origins to these companies, including Pfizer, Merck, Eli Lilly, Squibb and Abbott Laboratories.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn368"">368</A></SUP> During the 1940s the so-called “therapeutic revolution,” driven initially by the U.S. government’s emergency programs to develop antibiotics and synthetic antimalarial drugs, saw a “cascade of discoveries” including antibiotics, antihistamines, tranquilizers, steroids, and new prescription drugs for heart and lung disease, cancer, diabetes and ulcers.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn369"">369</A></SUP> Between 1939 and 1957, total U.S. drug sales volume increased by seven fold.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn370"">370</A></SUP></P><P><B><I>Federal support.</I></B> Federal support for the development of medicines began in the latter part of the Nineteenth Century. In 1887, a laboratory was created within the Marine Hospital Service (MHS) to pursue bacteriological research into deadly diseases such as cholera and diphtheria. In 1902 Congress renamed MHS the Hygienic Laboratory and delegated to it the authority to regulate the safety of biologics (technologies such as vaccines produced in animals), oversight which the laboratory continued until 1972. In 1930 the Hygienic Laboratory was renamed the National Institute of Health (NIH)<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn371"">371</A></SUP>. During World War II the institute expanded dramatically and Congress enacted legislation converting existing divisions within the NIH into institutes and centers with topic-specific research and training missions. The National Cancer Institute became part of NIH in 1944. From the 1940s to the 1960s NIH budgets grew substantially, enabling the institute to increase research grants to academic institutions, to construct research infrastructure, and to expand training.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn372"">372</A></SUP> The NIH budget also doubled between 1998 and 2003.</P><P>In addition to funding research and training in the life sciences, the federal government has contributed to the growth of the pharmaceutical industry through several landmark pieces of legislation. The 1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendment to Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act established the FDA drug approval process in its current form and this well-defined process has become the world “gold standard” for assessing the safety and effectiveness of new drugs, giving U.S.-based companies a major global competitive advantage. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the Hatch-Waxman Act) amended U.S. patent laws with respect to drugs to take into account the long time required to bring a new product to market by giving firms a larger period of protection in which to recoup their investments.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn373"">373</A></SUP> The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), which became effective in 1992, authorized the FDA to collect fees from drug makers to expedite the drug review process, a measure which substantially reduced the average review time for new medicines.</P><P><B><I>Emergence of biotechnology.</I></B> In the early 1970s researchers at Stanford University developed techniques for creating “recombinant DNA”— DNA sequences which combine genetic material from multiple sources.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn374"">374</A></SUP> This discovery, coupled with advances in biochemistry, microbiology and enzymology, enabled the emergence of a radical new discipline, molecular biology, addressing the molecular basis of biological processes.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn375"">375</A></SUP> Advances in microbiological understanding, coupled with the development of techniques of genetic engineering, led to the formation and rapid growth of the biotechnology industry. In 1976, Genetic Engineering Technology, Inc. (Genentech) was established to take advantage of advances in large molecule drug development and to commercialize drugs developed with recombinant DNA technology. Its first product was synthetic human insulin (1978). Thereafter the industry grew rapidly, reflecting the fact that biomedicines could address clinical areas that were not reachable with conventional therapeutics, such as oncology and treatment of HIV and autoimmune disorders.</P><P>The advent of new learning in the biological sciences was paralleled by the concept of “discovery by design” which emerged from advances in the information industry. Traditional drug development relied on screening large numbers of chemical variants to find one that acted against disease agents. In the 1970s, researchers began applying computational technology, x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance to develop hypothetical molecules that could interfere with biochemical sequences in disease agents. These “ideal” molecules were then given to chemists to search for real molecules whose structures most closely matched those of the ideal ones.<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn376"">376</A></SUP></P><P><B><I>Fostering <mark>innovation</mark>.</I></B> The rapid advances being made in the biological sciences in the 1970s were paralleled by a public policy debate in the U.S. arising out of a slowdown in U.S. economic and productivity growth. An influential group of economists at the University of Chicago encouraged a reappraisal of the U.S. patent system due to a perceived “anti-patent” bias in the legal system and a “general concern about industrial stagflation and a lack of significant technological <mark>innovation</mark>s.”<SUP><A class=""bk_pop"" href=""#ch6.fn377"">377</A></SUP> Reflecting changing attitudes in government and the courts, a series of policy measures followed which established the institutional basis for the explosive growth of the U.S. biotechnology industry—</P><UL><LI class=""half_rhythm""><DIV><I><B>The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980</B></I> provided that universities conducting federally-funded research could own the patents for technologies they developed, opening the door for the commercialization of university-based R&amp;D.</DIV></LI><LI class=""half_rhythm""><DIV>A key Supreme Court decision, <I><B>Diamond v.

Stanford University took advantage of the new Bayh-Dole rules and the new legal environment after the Chakrabarty decision to secure a patent on process technology for genetic engineering that had been developed by Drs. Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer, launching a new era of university-industry collaboration in biotechnology. The patent was granted in 1980 and between that year and its expiration in 1997, it was licensed on a non-exclusive basis at relatively low fee levels to 468 companies — many of them fledgling biotech firms — and had been utilized to develop 2,442 new products.

It is a cost reduction path as well as a performance enhancement path for a number of our customers, including AMD.”</P><FIGURE id=""attachment_40222"" style=""width: 327px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">Source: GlobalFoundries</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>The 12LP platform features enhancements for RF/analog applications, and also new market-focused capability for automotive, a major focus for GlobalFoundries and close customer AMD, which according to <A href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/20/tesla-building-an-ai-chip-for-its-cars-with-amd.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">a report</A> published Wednesday from CNBC has snagged Tesla as a customer (<A href=""https://www.streetinsider.com/Management+Comments/AMD+%28AMD%29+Officially+Denies+Tesla+%28TSLA%29+Rumors/13317752.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">however both GlobalFoundries and AMD categorically deny the rumor</A>).</P><P>The 12nm technology is an intermediate step on the way to the 7nm FinFET node, slated for risk production in the first half of 2018. “It’s not a full redesign, but there is some design work to move into it,” said GlobalFoundries Chief Technology Officer Gary Patton in a press briefing. “We want it to be as close to an extension of 14 as possible. If you’ve invested all this design IP in 14, you want to extend that as much as possible. We’ve already done several performance enhancements on our 14nm, and this is just the next step to provide another performance enhancement but also provide a path to get some additional scaling [ahead of 7nm].”</P><P>Tirias Research analyst Jim McGregor has a positive outlook on 12nm, despite what he believes is a marketing-driven naming convention. “It’s really a subnode,” he shared with <EM>HPCwire</EM>, “It’s kind of funny because most people don’t make their subnodes public. Every company, every manufacturer whether it be Intel or GlobalFoundries has those sub-nodes. GlobalFoundries isn’t doing a full node at 10nm; they’re still going to 7nm.”</P><P>“So the announcement of calling it 12nm kind of surprised me but [having a subnode is] not something new. Where most people are just getting into 10nm manufacturing at the end of this year, right now, GlobalFoundries is pushing for the beginning of their manufacturing for first half of 2018, so they’re still aggressive. It surprised me a little bit, but I think that it was more of a benefit for AMD than anything else.</P><P>“AMD is very competitive with Intel right now, and in some cases is slaughtering Intel, so they don’t want to be perceived as being behind the curve of Intel from a process perspective,” McGregor added.</P><P>AMD uses GlobalFoundries 14nm FinFET process technology for its x86 Zen-based chips (Ryzen and EPYC) and for its Vega high performance GPUs. So far only Ryzen and Vega have been tapped for a 12nm upgrade; whether the EPYC server platform will also take this intermediary step may well hinge on 7nm’s readiness and capacity.</P><P><A href=""https://www.hpcwire.com/2017/06/13/globalfoundries-7nm-chips-coming-2018-euv-2019/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">With the introduction of its 7nm process node</A>, GlobalFoundries is touting a 40 percent performance improvement over 14nm and a 60 percent power reduction. The company is launching 7nm with optical lithography and has designed the technology to be drop-in compliant with EUV.</P><P>GlobalFoundries’ CEO Jha said he expects 12nm to be the last optical node, followed by 7nm becoming the first EUV node. “It will start out optical just as…90nm started out being 200mm and then migrated to 300mm and of course the vast majority of 90nm shipped actually happened in 300mm so at the moment, I think the last 200mm node that we see is really 130-110nm and thereafter everything is 300mm. I think EUV will turn out to be that way; 7nm is the first place that will start.”</P><P>Jha’s keynote emphasized the coming age of connected intelligence (<A href=""https://www.enterprisetech.com/2017/09/21/real-time-ai-edge-coming-age-connected-intelligence/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">read <EM>EnterpriseTech</EM> coverage here</A>) that is pushing the development of new silicon technologies.</P><P>“We’re seeing an important shift in the business model of the foundry business,” the CEO said. “System companies, like Google, like Amazon, like Tesla, like Microsoft, are coming directly to foundries, they are working with EDA companies, IP companies and system design houses to get the IP. They want to control the hardware/software interface for the next generation of AI developments. They really want to control the architecture of both hardware and software, and it’s been the scenario over the last 10 years.</P><P>“People who control and capture the hardware/software interface capture most of the value in the industry, and certainly Apple has proven that’s where <mark>innovation</mark> occurs. I think more and more people are beginning to see this business model and I think we’re seeing more system houses hiring semiconductor engineers and driving <mark>innovation</mark>.”</P><DIV class=""sharing-container""><H4>Share this:</H4></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

But PathForward, the exascale computing challenge, comes close. We are going to make a computer so powerful and so fast that it will alter the way we live. If we succeed, life will be as different afterward as it was when we saw astronaut Neil Armstrong take &quot;a giant leap for mankind.&quot;</P><P>Earlier this year, the annual list of the world’s <A href=""https://www.top500.org/lists/2017/06/"" target=""_blank"">fastest computers</A> came out: The Chinese are responsible for the top two slots, and the third is held by the Swiss, knocking the U.S. down to the fourth spot.

It has awarded substantial development funds to Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Advanced Micro Devices, IBM, Intel, NVIDIA, and Cray.</P><P>Nic Dubé, chief strategist for HPC and lead system architect for exascale, believes it would be difficult to overstate the importance of the PathForward project. “This is the Space Race of our time,” he says.</P><DIV class=""button""><DIV class=""button-description""><P>Exascale: A race to the future of HPC</P></DIV><DIV class=""button-wrapper""><A href=""https://www.hpe.com/us/en/resources/servers/exascale-hpc-next-generation.html?jumpid=in_insights~510287587~exascale~hopkins_space_race"" class=""btn btn-primary"" target=""_blank"">Download the white paper</A></DIV></DIV><H3><STRONG>Dragsters can’t corner</STRONG></H3><P>Exascale means one quintillion operations per second. That’s 10 times faster than TaihuLight, the fastest computer currently up and running. Located at the National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi, China, it can run at 93 petaFLOPS, or 93 quadrillion calculations per second. </P><P><A href=""https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/06/us-doe-the-machine-exascale-supercomputer/"" target=""_blank"">China promises</A> to beat the U.S. to exascale by unveiling a prototype by the end of 2017 and a functional supercomputer by 2020. But several researchers at grantee companies believe that, in the end, what China can do is not that critical because the way they do it might limit its utility. Doing this project right is “not just a matter of FLOPS, but also of more memory bandwidth and more system balance,&quot; says Dubé. “Otherwise, you’re going to build an 'exaflopper.' You’re going to build a dragster.”</P><P>With a dragster, Dubé says, you can go really fast in a straight line, but good luck if you hit a corner. “We’d much rather have a Formula One than a dragster,” he says. “We need to corner.”</P><P>In other words, if you build a computer whose <EM>raison d'être</EM> is to go really fast, that’s what you’ll have—that and nothing more. But computers don’t exist simply to go really fast. They should help deal with the big, complex issues. </P><P>“To make real discoveries, it takes more than just speed, more than just compute,” agrees Gabriel Loh, fellow design engineer at <A href=""http://www.amd.com/en-us/who-we-are/corporate-information/research"" target=""_blank""><SPAN>AMD Research</SPAN></A><SPAN>. “Having information but lacking the ability to access it efficiently doesn’t help.”</SPAN></P><P>“FLOPS will happen; the challenge is to make it capable,” says Dubé. This is more difficult to do if you care about <A href=""https://insights.hpe.com/articles/<mark>climate</mark>-change-and-big-business-action-time-1708.html"">the energy you use to power it</A> and the <mark>pollution</mark> it leaves behind. But you have to care if you want more than speed. </P><H3><STRONG><SPAN>What will the first exascale computer look like? </SPAN></STRONG></H3><P>It is impossible to say exactly what shape the first functional exascale computer will take. Most awardees are close-mouthed about their strategy, and the DOE declines to comment. But it might be possible to put together an outline by examining some of the exascale obstacles and some possible ways around them.</P><P>There are some fundamental physical limitations standing in the way of exascale, according to Loh. The end of Moore’s Law will eventually make it impossible to add transistors to chips. <A href=""http://wgropp.cs.illinois.edu/courses/cs598-s16/lectures/lecture15.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Dennard Scaling</A> is also heading for a cliff, Loh points out, meaning the energy demands will eventually stop decreasing as you reduce linear connectivity.</P><P>In other words, just doing the same old thing is not going to get us to exascale, so an exascale computer will not look like what we’ve gotten used to in terms of its architecture. </P><P>HPE has expended a great deal of effort in finding <A href=""https://insights.hpe.com/articles/moores-law-is-ending-now-what-1706.html"">ways around the end of Moore’s Law</A>. The keystone development for the company is <SPAN thread=""1507832721146"" class=""thread"">Memory-Driven Computing</SPAN>, which places memory in the middle and allows any computer to access it. The memory is scalable up to 4,096 yottabytes, 1,000 times the amount of digital information that currently exists. Additionally, HPE is working on <A href=""https://www.labs.hpe.com/next-next/energy"">photonics</A>, the use of light to send information, <SPAN thread=""1507834975960"" class=""thread"">which costs the same whether the distance is 1,000 meters or 10 centimeters</SPAN>, as well as neuromorphic and approximate computing.</P><P>Like it or not, according to Loh, the era of pulling up the drawbridge is in its twilight. There are too many solutions, too many specialties, and too many customers, even within the DOE, to go it alone. That may explain why PathForward initially has six companies working on the project instead of just one or two.</P><P>“We’re going to see far greater interaction between parties across all levels of this stack,” says Loh. “We’ll see more co-design so we can create systems flexible enough without sacrificing performance and other critical capabilities.” This “whole system view” is something AMD has been practicing for years. </P><P>According to Dubé, cost is also an issue. Vendors have been impressed by the DOE, with a fiscal duty to make exascale usable on a wide scale, helping to strengthen the U.S. economy first and then the broader global economy.</P><P>“They don’t want us to build one-offs that are not shareable,” says Dubé, “They want legs and growth.” While some countries might approach such an undertaking with a “money is no object” attitude, vendors involved with PathForward know it is a significant issue indeed.</P><P>Currently, the price of information transfer is approximately $10 per gigabit per second. With the photonics apparatus that HPE uses on its Memory-Driven Computing project and the ring resonators research underway, the target is to bring that cost to 10 cents per gigabit per second, a huge savings. Any approach that reduces cost while maintaining performance goals is going to shape the final form of the PathForward exascale computer.  </P><H3><STRONG><SPAN>Why exascale matters </SPAN></STRONG></H3><P>Although Loh and Dubé speak for themselves, they say the same thing when asked about the utility of exascale computing.</P><P>“Full-scale planet modeling at high resolution!” says Dubé. “<mark>Climate change</mark> is the key problem of our time, and exascale computing will allow us to understand it at a level and with a completeness we have not been able to.”</P><P>Exascale can give us accuracy at scale with our Earth-based system models, according to Loh. “<mark>Climate change</mark> is personally key for me,” says Loh. “It is important for my children and my children’s children.”</P><P>Modeling at exascale will help us diagnose <mark>climate change</mark> precisely, and therefore lead to policies with a tangible and exact effect on elements of global warning. But that’s not all it can do, according to Loh. It is likely to lead to new techniques in solar energy and make non-solar energy sources and distribution grids much more efficient, reducing not just a burden on the earth, but our individual energy bills.</P><P>Another issue Dubé thought important in the exascale context is whole brain modeling. Use of exascale may prove the lynchpin for ambitious undertakings like the <A href=""https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/"" target=""_blank""><SPAN>Human Brain Project</SPAN></A><SPAN> and </SPAN><A href=""https://news.hpe.com/fighting-oblivion-with-a-new-kind-of-computer/""><SPAN>DZNE’s neurodegenerative research</SPAN></A><SPAN>. Successful exascale could contribute to the cure for diseases like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. </SPAN></P><P>Finally, because artificial intelligence is “data thirsty,” the ability to compute at exascale will allow us to develop machine learning at a much higher rate and “train” intelligent systems more quickly and more precisely, removing burdens from workers and keeping workplaces safer.</P><P>Regardless of what shape the PathForward exascale machine might take, and on top of what practical improvements might be possible with such a device, the mere fact that we are working on this “Space Race” brings us together not just as fellow citizens but as citizens of the world. It’s exciting. And we need that kind of excitement in this kind of world. </P><H3><SPAN> </SPAN>Exascale: Lessons for leaders</H3><UL><LI><SPAN>Developing exascale computing is on par with reaching the moon.</SPAN></LI><LI><SPAN>The u</SPAN><SPAN>tility of exascale computing is full-scale planet </SPAN><SPAN>modeling, which is important to solving <mark>climate change</mark>.</SPAN></LI><LI><SPAN>Exascale must be nimble, not just really fast, to solve complex world problems.</SPAN></LI></UL><H4>Related links:</H4></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

        Double, double, toil and trouble      </SPAN></P><DIV class=""es-content""><P>After a glorious 50 years, Moore’s law—which states that computer power doubles every two years at the same cost—is running out of steam. Tim Cross asks what might replace it</P><P>IN 1971 a small company called Intel released the 4004, its first ever microprocessor. The chip, measuring 12 square millimetres, contained 2,300 transistors—tiny electrical switches representing the 1s and 0s that are the basic language of computers. The gap between each transistor was 10,000 nanometres (billionths of a metre) in size, about as big as a red blood cell. The result was a miracle of miniaturisation, but still on something close to a human scale. A child with a decent microscope could have counted the individual transistors of the 4004.</P><P>The transistors on the Skylake chips Intel makes today would flummox any such inspection. The chips themselves are ten times the size of the 4004, but at a spacing of just 14 nanometres (nm) their transistors are invisible, for they are far smaller than the wavelengths of light human eyes and microscopes use. If the 4004’s transistors were blown up to the height of a person, the Skylake devices would be the size of an ant.</P><P>The difference between the 4004 and the Skylake is the difference between computer behemoths that occupy whole basements and stylish little slabs 100,000 times more powerful that slip into a pocket. It is the difference between telephone systems operated circuit by circuit with bulky electromechanical switches and an internet that ceaselessly shuttles data packets around the world in their countless trillions. It is a difference that has changed everything from metal-bashing to foreign policy, from the booking of holidays to the designing of H-bombs.</P><P>It is also a difference capable of easy mathematical quantification. In 1965 Gordon Moore, who would later become one of the founders of Intel, a chipmaker, wrote a paper noting that the number of electronic components which could be crammed into an integrated circuit was doubling every year. This exponential increase came to be known as Moore’s law.</P><P>In the 1970s the rate of doubling was reduced to once every two years. Even so, you would have had to be very brave to look at one of Intel’s 4004s in 1971 and believe that such a law would continue to hold for 44 years. After all, double something 22 times and you have 4m times more of it, or perhaps something 4m times better. But that is indeed what has happened. Intel does not publish transistor counts for its Skylake chips, but whereas the 4004 had 2,300 of them, the company’s Xeon Haswell E-5, launched in 2014, sports over 5 billion, just 22 nm apart.</P><P>Moore’s law is not a law in the sense of, say, Newton’s laws of motion. But Intel, which has for decades been the leading maker of microprocessors, and the rest of the industry turned it into a self-fulfilling prophecy.</P><P><SVG name=""graph1mobile"" data-mce-id=""graph1mobile"" class=""mobile"" version=""1.1"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" xmlns:XLINK=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" x=""0px"" y=""0px"" width=""320px"" height=""720px"" viewbox=""0 0 160 360"" enable-background=""new 0 0 160 360"" xml:space=""preserve""> </SVG><SVG name=""graph1desktop"" data-mce-id=""graph1desktop"" class=""desktop"" version=""1.1"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" xmlns:XLINK=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" x=""0px"" y=""0px"" width=""100%"" viewbox=""0 0 332 227"" enable-background=""new 0 0 332 227"" xml:space=""preserve""> </SVG></P><P>That fulfilment was made possible largely because transistors have the unusual quality of getting better as they get smaller; a small transistor can be turned on and off with less power and at greater speeds than a larger one. This meant that you could use more and faster transistors without needing more power or generating more waste heat, and thus that chips could get bigger as well as better.</P><P>Making chips bigger and transistors smaller was not easy; semiconductor companies have for decades spent heavily on R&amp;D, and the facilities—“fabs”—in which the chips have been made have become much more expensive. But each time transistors shrank, and the chips made out of them became faster and more capable, the market for them grew, allowing the makers to recoup their R&amp;D costs and reinvest in yet more research to make their products still tinier. The demise of this virtuous circle has been predicted many times. “There’s a law about Moore’s law,” jokes Peter Lee, a vice-president at Microsoft Research: “The number of people predicting the death of Moore’s law doubles every two years.” But now the computer industry is increasingly aware that the jig will soon be up. For some time, making transistors smaller has no longer been making them more energy-efficient; as a result, the operating speed of high-end chips has been on a plateau since the mid-2000s (see chart). And while the benefits of making things smaller have been decreasing, the costs have been rising. This is in large part because the components are approaching a fundamental limit of smallness: the atom. A Skylake transistor is around 100 atoms across, and the fewer atoms you have, the harder it becomes to store and manipulate electronic 1s and 0s. Smaller transistors now need trickier designs and extra materials. And as chips get harder to make, fabs get ever more expensive. Handel Jones, the CEO of International Business Strategies, reckons that a fab for state-of-the-art microprocessors now costs around $7 billion. He thinks that by the time the industry produces 5nm chips (which at past rates of progress might be in the early 2020s), this could rise to over $16 billion, or nearly a third of Intel’s current annual revenue. In 2015 that revenue, at $55.4 billion, was only 2% more than in 2011. Such slow increases in revenue and big increases in cost seem to point to an obvious conclusion. “From an economic standpoint, Moore’s law is over,” says Linley Gwennap, who runs the Linley Group, a firm of Silicon Valley analysts.</P><P>The pace of advance has been slowing for a while. Marc Snir, a supercomputing expert at Argonne National Laboratory, Illinois, points out that the industry’s International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors, a collaborative document that tries to forecast the near future of chipmaking, has been over-optimistic for a decade. Promised manufacturing <mark>innovation</mark>s have proved more difficult than expected, arriving years late or not at all.</P><P>Brian Krzanich, Intel’s boss, has publicly admitted that the firm’s rate of progress has slowed. Intel has a biennial “tick-tock” strategy: in one year it will bring out a chip featuring smaller transistors (“tick”); the following year it tweaks that chip’s design (“tock”) and prepares to shrink the transistors again in the following year. But when its first 14nm chips, codenamed Broadwell, ticked their way to market in 2014 they were nearly a year behind schedule. The tick to 10nm that was meant to follow the tock of the Skylakes has slipped too; Intel has said such products will not now arrive until 2017. Analysts reckon that because of technological problems the company is now on a “tick-tock-tock” cycle. Other big chipmakers have had similar problems.</P><P>Moore’s law has not hit a brick wall. Chipmakers are spending billions on new designs and materials that may make transistors amenable to a bit more shrinkage and allow another few turns of the exponential crank. They are also exploring ways in which performance can be improved with customised designs and cleverer programming. In the past the relentless doubling and redoubling of computing power meant there was less of an incentive to experiment with other sorts of improvement.</P><P> </P><P class=""xhead"">Try a different route</P><P>More radically, some hope to redefine the computer itself. One idea is to harness quantum mechanics to perform certain calculations much faster than any classical computer could ever hope to do. Another is to emulate biological brains, which perform impressive feats using very little energy. Yet another is to diffuse computer power rather than concentrating it, spreading the ability to calculate and communicate across an ever greater range of everyday objects in the nascent internet of things. Moore’s law provided an unprecedented combination of blistering progress and certainty about the near future. As that certainty wanes, the effects could be felt far beyond the chipmakers faced with new challenges and costs. In a world where so many things—from the cruising speed of airliners to the median wage—seem to change little from decade to decade, the exponential growth in computing power underlies the future plans of technology providers working on everything from augmented-reality headsets to self-driving cars. More important, it has come to stand in the imagination for progress itself. If something like it cannot be salvaged, the world would look a grimmer place. At the same time, some see benefits in a less predictable world that gives all sorts of new computing technologies an opportunity to come into their own. “The end of Moore’s law could be an inflection point,” says Microsoft’s Dr Lee. “It’s full of challenges—but it’s also a chance to strike out in different directions, and to really shake things up.”</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class=""es-section"" id=""s-2""><DIV class=""es-image-wrap""><H2 class=""es-section-headline""><A name=""section-2"">
        More Moore: The incredible shrinking transistor      </A></H2></DIV><DIV class=""es-content""><P>New sorts of transistors can eke out a few more iterations of Moore’s law, but they will get increasingly expensive</P><P>THANKS to the exponential power of Moore’s law, the electronic components that run modern computers vastly outnumber all the leaves on the Earth’s trees. Chris Mack, a chipmaking expert, working from a previous estimate by VLSI Research, an analysis firm, reckons that perhaps 400 billion billion (4x1020) transistors were churned out in 2015 alone. That works out at about 13 trillion a second. At the same time they have become unimaginably small: millions could fit on the full stop at the end of this sentence.</P><P>A transistor is a sort of switch. To turn it on, a voltage is applied to its gate, which allows the current to flow through the channel between the transistor’s source and drain (see first diagram). When no current flows, the transistor is off. The on-off states represent the 1s and 0s that are the fundamental language of computers.</P><P>The silicon from which these switches are made is a semiconductor, meaning that its electrical properties are halfway between those of a conductor (in which current can flow easily) and an insulator (in which it cannot). The electrical characteristics of a semiconductor can be tweaked, either by a process called “doping”, in which the material is spiced with atoms of other elements, such as arsenic or boron, or by the application of an electrical field.</P><P>In a silicon transistor, the channel will be doped with one material and the source and drain with another. Doping alters the amount of energy required for any charge to flow through a semiconductor, so where two differently doped materials abut each other, current cannot flow. But when the device is switched on, the electric field from the gate generates a thin, conductive bridge within the channel which completes the circuit, allowing current to flow through.</P><P>For a long time that basic design worked better and better as transistors became ever smaller. But at truly tiny scales it begins to break down. In modern transistors the source and drain are very close together, of the order of 20nm. That causes the channel to leak, with a residual current flowing even when the device is meant to be off, wasting power and generating unwanted heat.</P><P>Heat from this and other sources causes serious problems. Many modern chips must either run below their maximum speeds or even periodically switch parts of themselves off to avoid overheating, which limits their performance.</P><P>Chipmakers are trying various methods to avoid this. One of them, called strained silicon, which was introduced by Intel in 2004, involves stretching the atoms of the silicon crystal further apart than normal, which lubricates the passage of charge carriers through the channel, reducing the heat generated.</P><P>In another technique, first adopted in 2007, metal oxides are used to combat the effects of tunnelling, a quantum phenomenon in which particles (such as electrons) on one side of a seemingly impermeable barrier turn up on the other side without ever passing through the intervening space. Developing more such esoteric techniques may allow chipmakers to go on shrinking transistors for a little longer, but not much.</P><P class=""xhead"">The 3D effect</P><P>Beyond that, two broad changes will be needed. First, the design of the transistor will have to be changed radically. Second, the industry will have to find a replacement for silicon, the electrical properties of which have already been pushed to their limits.</P><P>One solution to the problem of leaking current is to redesign the channel and the gate. Conventionally, transistors have been flat, but in 2012 Intel added a third dimension to its products. To enable it to build chips with features just 22nm apart, it switched to transistors known as “finFET”, which feature a channel that sticks up from the surface of the chip. The gate is then wrapped around the channel’s three exposed sides (see second diagram), which gives it much better control over what takes place inside the channel. These new transistors are trickier to make, but they switch 37% faster than old ones of the same size and consume only half as much power.</P><P>The next logical step, says Mr Snir of Argonne National Laboratory, is “gate-all-around” transistors, in which the channel is surrounded by its gate on all four sides. That offers maximum control, but it adds extra steps to the manufacturing process, since the gate must now be built in multiple sections. Big chipmakers such as Samsung have said that it might take gate-all-around transistors to build chips with features 5nm apart, a stage that Samsung and other makers expect to be reached by the early 2020s.</P><P>Beyond that, more exotic solutions may be needed. One idea is to take advantage of the quantum tunnelling that is such an annoyance for conventional transistors, and that will only get worse as transistors shrink further. It is possible, by applying electrical fields, to control the rate at which tunnelling happens. A low rate of leakage would correspond to a 0; a high rate to a 1. The first experimental tunnelling transistor was demonstrated by a team at IBM in 2004. Since then researchers have been working to commercialise them.</P><P>In 2015 a team led by Kaustav Banerjee, of the University of California, reported in Nature that they had built a tunnelling transistor with a working voltage of just 0.1, far below the 0.7V of devices now in use, which means much less heat. But there is more work to be done before tunnelling transistors become viable, says Greg Yeric of ARM, a British designer of microchips: for now they do not yet switch on and off quickly enough to allow them to be used for fast chips. Jim Greer and his colleagues at Ireland’s Tyndall Institute are working on another idea. Their device, called a junctionless nanowire transistor (JNT), aims to help with another problem of building at tiny scales: getting the doping right. “These days you’re talking about [doping] a very small amount of silicon indeed. You’ll soon be at the point where even one or two misplaced dopant atoms could drastically alter the behaviour of your transistor,” says Dr Greer.</P><P>Instead, he and his colleagues propose to build their JNTs, just 3nm across, out of one sort of uniformly doped silicon. Normally that would result in a wire rather than a switch: a device that is uniformly conductive and cannot be turned off. But at these tiny scales the electrical influence of the gate penetrates right through the wire, so the gate alone can prevent current flowing when the transistor is switched off.</P><P>Whereas a conventional transistor works by building an electrical bridge between a source and a drain that are otherwise insulated, Dr Greer’s device works the other way: more like a hose in which the gate acts to stop the current from flowing. “This is true nanotechnology,” he says. “Our device only works at these sorts of scales. The big advantage is you don’t have to worry about manufacturing these fiddly junctions.”</P><P class=""xhead"">Material difference</P><P>Chipmakers are also experimenting with materials beyond silicon. Last year a research alliance including Samsung, Global Foundries, IBM and State University New York unveiled a microchip made with components 7nm apart, a technology that is not expected to be in consumers’ hands until 2018 at the earliest. It used the same finFET design as the present generation of chips, with slight modifications, but although most of the device was built from the usual silicon, around half of its transistors had channels made from a silicon-germanium (SiGe) alloy.</P><P>This was chosen because it is, in some ways, a better conductor than silicon. Once again, that means lower power usage and allows the transistor to switch on and off more quickly, boosting the speed of the chip. But it is not a panacea, says Heike Riel, the director of the physical-sciences department at IBM Research. Modern chips are built from two types of transistor. One is designed to conduct electrons, which carry a negative charge. The other sort is designed to conduct “holes”, which are places in a semiconductor that might contain electrons but happen not to; these, as it turns out, behave as if they were positively charged electrons. And although SiGe excels at transporting holes, it is rather less good at moving electrons than silicon is.</P><P>Future paths to higher performance along these lines will probably require both SiGe and another compound that moves electrons even better than silicon. The materials with the most favourable electrical properties are alloys of elements such as indium, gallium and arsenide, collectively known as III-V materials after their location in the periodic table.</P><P>The trouble is that these materials do not mix easily with silicon. The spacing between the atoms in their crystal lattices is different from that in silicon, so adding a layer of them to the silicon substrate from which all chips are made causes stress that can have the effect of cracking the chip.</P><P>The best-known alternative is graphene, a single-atom-thick (and hence two-dimensional) form of <mark>carbon</mark>. Graphene conducts electrons and holes very well. The difficulty is making it stop. Researchers have tried to get around this by doping, squashing or squeezing graphene, or applying electric fields to change its electrical properties. Some progress has been made: the University of Manchester reported a working graphene transistor in 2008; a team led by Guanxiong Liu at the University of California built devices using a property of the material called “negative resistance” in 2013. But the main impact of graphene, says Dr Yeric, has been to spur interest in other two-dimensional materials. “Graphene sort of unlocked the box,” he says. “Now we’re looking at things like sheets of molybdenum disulphide, or black phosphorous, or phosphorous-boron compounds.” Crucially, all of those, like silicon, can easily be switched on and off.</P><P>If everything goes according to plan, says Dr Yeric, novel transistor designs and new materials might keep things ticking along for another five or six years, by which time the transistors may be 5nm apart. But beyond that “we’re running out of ways to stave off the need for something really radical.”</P><P>His favoured candidate for that is something called “spintronics”. Whereas electronics uses the charge of an electron to represent information, spintronics uses “spin”, another intrinsic property of electrons that is related to the concept of rotational energy an object possesses. Usefully, spin comes in two varieties, up and down, which can be used to represent 1 and 0. And the computing industry has some experience with spintronics already: it is used in hard drives, for instance.</P><P>Research into spintronic transistors has been going on for more than 15 years, but none has yet made it into production. Appealingly, the voltage needed to drive them is tiny: 10-20 millivolts, hundreds of times lower than for a conventional transistor, which would solve the heat problem at a stroke. But that brings design problems of its own, says Dr Yeric. With such minute voltages, distinguishing a 1 or a 0 from electrical noise becomes tricky.</P><P>“It’s relatively easy to build a fancy new transistor in the lab,” says Linley Gwennap, the analyst. “But in order to replace what we’re doing today, you need to be able to put billions on a chip, at a reasonable cost, with high reliability and almost no defects. I hate to say never, but it is very difficult.” That makes it all the more important to pursue other ways of making better computers.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class=""es-section"" id=""s-3""><DIV class=""es-image-wrap""><H2 class=""es-section-headline""><A name=""section-3"">
        New designs: Taking it to another dimension      </A></H2></DIV><DIV class=""es-content""><P>How to get more out of existing transistors</P><P>STRICTLY speaking, Moore’s law is about the ever greater number of electronic components that can be crammed onto a given device. More generally, though, it is used as shorthand for saying that computers are always getting better. As transistors become harder and harder to shrink, computing firms are starting to look at making better use of the transistors they already have. “Managers in the past wouldn’t want to invest a lot in intensive design,” says Greg Yeric at ARM. “I think that’s going to start shifting.”</P><P>One way is to make the existing chips work harder. Computer chips have a master clock; every time it ticks, the transistors within switch on or off. The faster the clock, the faster the chip can carry out instructions. Increasing clock rates has been the main way of making chips faster over the past 40 years. But since the middle of the past decade clock rates have barely budged.</P><P>Chipmakers have responded by using the extra transistors that came with shrinking to duplicate a chip’s existing circuitry. Such “multi-core” chips are, in effect, several processors in one, the idea being that lashing several slower chips together might give better results than relying on a single speedy one. Most modern desktop chips feature four, eight or even 16 cores.</P><P>But, as the industry has discovered, multi-core chips rapidly hit limits. “The consensus was that if we could keep doing that, if we could go to chips with 1,000 cores, everything would be fine,” says Doug Burger, an expert in chip design at Microsoft. But to get the best out of such chips, programmers have to break down tasks into smaller chunks that can be worked on simultaneously. “It turns out that’s really hard,” says Dr Burger. Indeed, for some mathematical tasks it is impossible.</P><P>Another approach is to specialise. The most widely used chips, such as Intel’s Core line or those based on ARM’s Cortex design (found in almost every smartphone on the planet) are generalists, which makes them flexible. That comes at a price: they can do a bit of everything but excel at nothing. Tweaking hardware to make it better at dealing with specific mathematical tasks “can get you something like a 100- to 1,000-fold performance improvement over some general solution”, says Bob Colwell, who helped design Intel’s Pentium chips.</P><P>When Moore’s law was doubling performance every couple of years at no cost anyway, there was little incentive to customise processing this way. But now that transistors are not necessarily getting faster and cheaper all the time, those tradeoffs are changing.</P><P class=""xhead"">Something special</P><P>That was Sean Mitchell’s thinking when, a decade ago, he co-founded a company called Movidius. The firm designs chips for use in computer vision, a booming field with applications in everything from robotics to self-driving cars to augmented reality. Movidius has since raised nearly $90m in funding.</P><P>“When we looked at the general-purpose chips out there,” says Dr Mitchell, “we found that they were very inefficient.” So Dr Mitchell and his co-founders set about designing their own specialised microprocessor.</P><P>“We’ve got to process high-resolution images, each containing millions of pixels, and coming in at 60, 90 or even 120 frames per second,” he says. By tweaking the hardware to the task at hand—by providing exactly the mix of computational resources necessary for the mathematics of visual processing while leaving out any of the extraneous logic that would allow a general-purpose chip to perform other tasks—Movidius’s Myriad 2 chip can crunch huge amounts of visual information but use less than a watt of power (which is about 20% of the consumption of the chips in smartphones and only about 1% of those in desktop computers). In January the firm announced a deal with Google.</P><P>Custom-built chips are already in use in other parts of the computing industry. The best-known examples are the graphics chips used to improve the visuals of video games, designed by firms such as Nvidia and AMD and first marketed to consumers in the mid-1990s. Intel’s newer Pentium chips also come with built-in specialised logic for tasks such as decoding video. But there are downsides.</P><P>Designing new chips takes years and can cost tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars. Specialised chips are also harder to program than general-purpose ones. And, by their very nature, they improve performance only on certain tasks.</P><P>A better target for specialised logic, at least at first, might be data centres, the vast computing warehouses that power the servers running the internet.</P><P>Because of the sheer volume of information they process, data centres will always be able to find a use for a chip that can do only one thing, but do it very well.</P><P>With that in mind, Microsoft, one of the world’s biggest software firms and providers of cloud-computing services, is venturing into the chip-design business. In 2014 it announced a new device called Catapult that uses a special kind of chip called a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), the configuration of which can be reshaped at will. FPGAs offer a useful compromise between specialisation and flexibility, says Dr Burger, who led the team that developed Catapult: “The idea is to have programmable hardware alongside programmable software.” When one task is finished, an FPGA can be reconfigured for another job in less than a second.</P><P>The chips are already in use with Bing, Microsoft’s search engine, and the company says this has doubled the number of queries a server can process in a given time. There are plenty of other potential applications, says Peter Lee, Dr Burger’s boss at Microsoft. FPGAs excel when one specific algorithm has to be applied over and over again to torrents of data. One idea is to use Catapult to encrypt data flowing between computers to keep them secure. Another possibility is to put it to work on voice- and image-recognition jobs for cloud-connected smartphones.</P><P>The technology is not new, but until now there was little reason to use it. What is new is that “the cloud is growing at an incredible rate,” says Dr Burger. “And now that Moore’s law is slowing down, that makes it much harder to add enough computing capacity to keep up. So these sorts of post-Moore projects start to make economic sense.”</P><P>At the IBM research lab on the shores of Lake Zurich, ambitions are set even higher. On a table in one of the labs sits a chip connected by thin hoses to a flask of purple-black liquid. Patrick Ruch, who works in IBM’s Advanced Thermal Packaging group, sees this liquid as the key to a fundamental redesign of data centres. He and his colleagues think they can shrink a modern supercomputer of the sort that occupies a warehouse into a volume about the size of a cardboard box—by making better use of the third dimension.</P><DIV id=""Panel01""> </DIV><P>Leaving aside <mark>innovation</mark>s like finned transistors (see previous article), modern chips are essentially flat. But a number of companies, including IBM, are now working on stacking chips on top of each other, like flats in a tower block, to allow designers to pack more transistors into a given area. Samsung already sells storage systems made from vertically stacked flash memory. Last year Intel and Micron, a big memory-manufacturer, announced a new memory technology called 3D Xpoint that also uses stacking.</P><P>IBM’s researchers are working on something slightly different: chip stacks in which slices of memory are sandwiched between slices of processing logic. That would allow engineers to pack a huge amount of computing into a tiny volume, as well as offering big performance benefits. A traditional computer’s main memory is housed several centimetres from its processor. At silicon speeds, a centimetre is a vast distance. Sending signals across such distances also wastes energy. Moving the memory inside the chip cuts those distances from centimetres to micrometres, allowing it to shuttle data around more quickly. But there are two big problems with 3D chips. The first is heat. Flat chips are bad enough; in a conventional data centre thousands of fans blowing hot air out of the server racks emit a constant roar. As more layers are added, the volume inside the chip, where the heat is generated, grows faster than the outside area from which it can be removed.</P><P>The second problem is getting electricity in. Chips communicate with the outside world via hundreds of metal “pins” on their undersides. Modern chips are so power-hungry that up to 80% of these pins are reserved for transporting electricity, leaving only a few to get data in and out. In 3D those constraints multiply, as the same number of pins must serve a much more complicated chip.</P><P>IBM hopes to kill two birds with one stone by fitting its 3D chips with miniscule internal plumbing. Microfluidic channels will carry cooling liquid into the heart of the chip, removing heat from its entire volume at once. The firm has already tested the liquid-cooling technology with conventional, flat chips. The micro fluidic system could ultimately remove around a kilowatt of heat—about the same as the output of one bar of an electric heater—from a cubic centimetre of volume, says Bruno Michel, the head of the group (see Brain scan, previous page).</P><P>But the liquid will do more than cool the chips: it will deliver energy as well. Inspired by his background in biology, Dr Michel has dubbed the liquid “electronic blood”. If he can pull it off, it will do for computer chips what biological blood does for bodies: provide energy and regulate the temperature at the same time. Dr Michel’s idea is a variant of a flow battery, in which power is provided by two liquids that, meeting on either side of a membrane, produce electricity.</P><P>Flow batteries are fairly well understood. The electricity industry has been studying them as a way to store intermittent power from renewable energy sources. Dr Michel’s system is still many years away from commercial deployment, but the principle has been established: when Dr Ruch switches on the flow, the chip to which the hoses are connected flickers into life—without a plug or a wire in sight.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class=""es-section"" id=""s-4""><DIV class=""es-image-wrap""><H2 class=""es-section-headline""><A name=""section-4"">
        Quantum computing: Harnessing weirdness      </A></H2></DIV><DIV class=""es-content""><P>Quantum computers could offer a giant leap in speed—but only for certain applications</P><P>THE D-Wave 2X is a black box, 3.3 metres to a side, that looks a bit like a shorter, squatter version of the enigmatic monoliths from the film “2001: A Space Odyssey”. Its insides, too, are intriguing. Most of the space, says Colin Williams, D-Wave’s director of business development, is given over to a liquid-helium refrigeration system designed to cool it to 0.015 Kelvin, only a shade above the lowest temperature that is physically possible. Magnetic shielding protects the chip at the machine’s heart from ripples and fluctuations in the Earth’s magnetic field.</P><P>Such high-tech coddling is necessary because the D-Wave 2X is no ordinary machine; it is one of the world’s first commercially available quantum computers. In fact, it is not a full-blown computer in the conventional sense of the word, for it is limited to one particular area of mathematics: finding the lowest value of complicated functions. But that specialism can be rather useful, especially in engineering. D-Wave’s client list so far includes Google, NASA and Lockheed Martin, a big American weapons-maker.</P><P>D-Wave’s machine has caused controversy, especially among other quantum-computing researchers. For a while academics in the field even questioned that the firm had built a true quantum machine. Those arguments were settled in 2014, in D-Wave’s favour. But it is still not clear whether the machine is indeed faster than its non-quantum rivals.</P><P>D-Wave, based in Canada, is only one of many firms in the quantum-computing business. And whereas its machine is highly specialised, academics have also been trying to build more general ones that could attack any problem. In recent years they have been joined by some of the computing industry’s biggest guns, such as Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, IBM and Google.</P><P>Quantum computing is a fundamentally different way of manipulating information. It could offer a huge speed advantage for some mathematical problems that still stump ordinary machines—and would continue to stump them even if Moore’s law were to carry on indefinitely. It is also often misunderstood and sometimes overhyped. That is partly because the field itself is so new that its theoretical underpinnings are still a work in progress. There are some tasks at which quantum machines will be unambiguously faster than the best non-quantum sort. But for a lot of others the advantage is less clear. “In many cases we don’t know whether a given quantum algorithm will be faster than the best-known classical one,” says Scott Aaronson, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A working quantum computer would be a boon—but no one is sure how much of one.</P><P>The basic unit of classical computing is the bit, the smallest possible chunk of information. A bit can can take just two values: yes or no, on or off, 1 or 0. String enough bits together and you can represent numbers of any size and perform all sorts of mathematical manipulations upon them. But classical machines can deal with just a handful of those bit-strings at a time. And although some of them can now crunch through billions of strings every second, some problems are so complex that even the latest computers cannot keep pace. Finding the prime factors of a big number is one example: the difficulty of the problem increases exponentially as the number in question gets bigger. Each tick of Moore’s law, in other words, enables the factoring of only slightly larger numbers. And finding prime factors forms the mathematical backbone of much of the cryptography that protects data as they scoot around the internet, precisely because it is hard.</P><P>Quantum bits, or qubits, behave differently, thanks to two counterintuitive quantum phenomena. The first is “superposition”, a state of inherent uncertainty that allows particles to exist in a mixture of states at the same time. For instance, a quantum particle, rather than having a specific location, merely has a certain chance of appearing in any one place.</P><DIV class=""TQ--subbox""><H1 class=""TQ--subbox-header"">Wait for it</H1><DIV class=""TQ--subbox-body""><H2 class=""TQ--subbox-rubric"">A pipeline of new technologies to prolong Moore’s magic</H2><H3>THE world’s IT firms spend huge amounts on research and development.

The second quantum phenomenon, “entanglement”, binds together the destiny of a quantity of different particles, so that what happens to one of them will immediately affect the others. That allows a quantum computer to manipulate all of its qubits at the same time.</P><P>The upshot is a machine that can represent—and process—vast amounts of data at once. A 300-qubit machine, for instance, could represent 2<SUP>300</SUP> different strings of 1s and 0s at the same time, a number roughly equivalent to the number of atoms in the visible universe. And because the qubits are entangled, it is possible to manipulate all those numbers simultaneously.</P><P>Yet building qubits is hard. Superpositions are delicate things: the slightest puff of heat, or a passing electromagnetic wave, can cause them to collapse (or “decohere”), ruining whatever calculation was being run. That is why D-Wave’s machine—and all other quantum computers—have to be so carefully isolated from outside influences. Still, progress has been quick: in 2012 the record for maintaining a quantum superposition without the use of silicon stood at two seconds; by last year it had risen to six hours.</P><P>Another problem is what to build the qubits out of. Academics at the universities of Oxford and Maryland, among others, favour tickling tightly confined ions with laser beams. Hewlett-Packard, building on its expertise in optics, thinks that photons—the fundamental particles of light—hold the key. Microsoft is pursuing a technology that is exotic even by the standards of quantum computing, involving quasi-particles called anyons. Like those “holes” in a semiconductor, anyons are not real particles, but a mathematically useful way of describing phenomena that behave as if they were. Microsoft is currently far behind any of its competitors, but hopes eventually to come up with more elegantly designed and much less error-prone machines than the rest.</P><P>Probably the leading approach, used by Google, D-Wave and IBM, is to represent qubits as currents flowing through superconducting wires (which offer no electrical resistance at all). The presence or absence of a current—or alternatively, whether it is circulating clockwise or anti-clockwise—stands for a 1 or a 0. What makes this attractive is that the required circuits are relatively easy to etch into silicon, using manufacturing techniques with which the industry is already familar. And superconducting circuits are becoming more robust, too.</P><P>Last year a team led by John Martinis, a quantum physicist working at Google, published a paper describing a system of nine superconducting qubits in which four could be examined without collapsing the other five, allowing the researchers to check for, and correct, mistakes. “We’re finally getting to the stage now where we can start to build an entire system,” says Dr Martinis.</P><P>Using a quantum computer is hard, too. In order to get the computer to answer the question put to it, its operator must measure the state of its qubits. That causes them to collapse out of their superposed state so that the result of the calculation can be read. And if the measurement is done the wrong way, the computer will spit out just one of its zillions of possible states, and almost certainly the wrong one. “You will have built the world’s most expensive random-number generator,” says Dr Aaronson.</P><P>For a quantum algorithm to work, the machine must be manipulated in such a way that the probability of obtaining the right answer is continually reinforced while the chances of getting a wrong answer are suppressed. One of the first useful algorithms for this purpose was published in 1994 by Peter Shor, a mathematician; it is designed to solve the prime-factorising problem explained above. Dr Aaronson points out that alongside error correction of the sort that Dr Martinis has pioneered, Dr Shor’s algorithm was one of the crucial advances which persuaded researchers that quantum computers were more than just a theoretical curiosity. Since then more such algorithms have been discovered. Some are known to be faster than their best-known classical rivals; others have yet to prove their speed advantage.</P><P class=""xhead"">A cryptographer’s dream</P><P>That leaves open the question of what, exactly, a quantum computer would be good for. Matthias Troyer, of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, has spent the past four years conducting a rigorous search for a “killer app” for quantum computers. One commonly cited, and exciting, application is in codebreaking. Dr Shor’s algorithm would allow a quantum computer to make short work of most modern cryptographic codes. Documents leaked in early 2014 by Edward Snowden, a former American spy, proved what cryptographers had long suspected: that America’s National Security Agency (NSA) was working on quantum computers for exactly that reason. Last August the NSA recommended that the American government begin switching to new codes that are potentially less susceptible to quantum attack. The hope is that this will pre-empt any damage before a working quantum computer is built.</P><P>Another potential killer app is artificial intelligence (AI). Firms such as Google, Facebook and Baidu, China’s biggest search engine, are already putting significant sums into computers than can teach themselves to understand human voices, identify objects in images, interpret medical scans and so on. Such AI programs must be trained before they can be deployed. For a face-recognition algorithm, for instance, that means showing it thousands of images. The computer has to learn which of these are faces and which are not, and perhaps which picture shows a specific face and which not, and come up with a rule that efficiently transforms the input of an image into a correct identification.</P><P>Ordinary computers can already perform all these tasks, but D-Wave’s machine is meant to be much faster. In 2013 Google and NASA put one of them into their newly established Quantum AI Lab to see whether the machine could provide a speed boost. The practical value of this would be immense, but Dr Troyer says the answer is not yet clear.</P><P>In his view, the best use for quantum computers could be in simulating quantum mechanics itself, specifically the complicated dance of electrons that is chemistry. With conventional computers, that is fiendishly difficult. The 2013 Nobel prize for chemistry was awarded for the development of simplified models that can be run on classical computers. But, says Dr Troyer, “for complex molecules, the existing [models] are not good enough.” His team reckoned that a mixed approach, combining classical machines with the quantum sort, would do better. Their first efforts yielded algorithms with running times of hundreds of years. Over the past three years, though, the researchers have refined their algorithms to the point where a simulation could be run in hundreds of seconds instead.</P><P>It may not be as exciting as AI or code-breaking, but being able to simulate quantum processes accurately could revolutionise all sorts of industrial chemistry. The potential applications Dr Troyer lists include better catalysts, improved engine design, a better understanding of biological molecules and improving things like the Haber process, which produces the bulk of the world’s fertilisers. All of those are worthwhile goals that no amount of conventional computing power seems likely to achieve.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class=""es-section"" id=""s-5""><DIV class=""es-image-wrap""><H2 class=""es-section-headline""><A name=""section-5"">
        What comes next: Horses for courses      </A></H2></DIV><DIV class=""es-content""><P>The end of Moore’s law will make the computer industry a much more complicated place</P><P>WHEN Moore’s law was in its pomp, life was simple. Computers got better in predictable ways and at a predictable rate. As the metronome begins to falter, the computer industry will become a more complicated place. Things like clever design and cunning programming are useful, says Bob Colwell, the Pentium chip designer, “but a collection of one-off ideas can’t make up for the lack of an underlying exponential.”</P><P>Progress will become less predictable, narrower and less rapid than the industry has been used to. “As Moore’s law slows down, we are being forced to make tough choices between the three key metrics of power, performance and cost,” says Greg Yeric, the chip designer at ARM. “Not all end uses will be best served by one particular answer.”</P><P>And as computers become ever more integrated into everyday life, the definition of progress will change. “Remember: computer firms are not, fundamentally, in it to make ever smaller transistors,” says Marc Snir, of Argonne National Laboratory. “They’re in it to produce useful products, and to make money.”</P><P>Moore’s law has moved computers from entire basements to desks to laps and hence to pockets. The industry is hoping that they will now carry on to everything from clothes to smart homes to self-driving cars. Many of those applications demand things other than raw performance. “I think we will see a lot of creativity unleashed over next decade,” says Linley Gwennap, the Silicon Valley analyst. “We’ll see performance improved in different ways, and existing tech used in new ways.”</P><P><SVG name=""svg2mobile"" data-mce-id=""svg2mobile"" class=""mobile"" version=""1.1"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" xmlns:XLINK=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" x=""0px"" y=""0px"" width=""320px"" viewbox=""0 0 160 157"" enable-background=""new 0 0 160 157"" xml:space=""preserve""> </SVG><SVG name=""svg2desktop"" data-mce-id=""svg2desktop"" class=""desktop"" version=""1.1"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" xmlns:XLINK=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" x=""0px"" y=""0px"" width=""320px"" viewbox=""0 0 160 157"" enable-background=""new 0 0 160 157"" xml:space=""preserve""> </SVG></P><P>Mr Gwennap points to the smartphone as an example of the kind of <mark>innovation</mark> that might serve as a model for the computing industry. Only four years after the iPhone first launched, in 2011, smartphone sales outstripped those of conventional PCs. Smartphones would never have been possible without Moore’s law. But although the small, powerful, frugal chips at their hearts are necessary, they are not sufficient. The appeal of smartphones lies not just in their performance but in their light, thin and rugged design and their modest power consumption. To achieve this, Apple has been heavily involved in the design of the iPhone’s chips.</P><P>And they do more than crunch numbers. Besides their microprocessors, smartphones contain tiny versions of other components such as accelerometers, GPS receivers, radios and cameras. That combination of computing power, portability and sensor capacity allows smartphones to interact with the world and with their users in ways that no desktop computer ever could.</P><P>Virtual reality (VR) is another example. This year the computer industry will make another attempt at getting this off the ground, after a previous effort in the 1990s. Firms such as Oculus, an American startup bought by Facebook, Sony, which manufactures the PlayStation console, and HTC, a Taiwanese electronics firm, all plan to launch virtual-reality headsets to revolutionise everything from films and video games to architecture and engineering.</P><P>A certain amount of computing power is necessary to produce convincing graphics for VR users, but users will settle for far less than photo-realism. The most important thing, say the manufacturers, is to build fast, accurate sensors that can keep track of where a user’s head is pointing, so that the picture shown by the goggles can be updated correctly. If the sensors are inaccurate, the user will feel “VR sickness”, an unpleasant sensation closely related to motion sickness. But good sensors do not require superfast chips.</P><P>The biggest market of all is expected to be the “internet of things”—in which cheap chips and sensors will be attached to everything, from fridges that order food or washing machines that ask clothes for laundering instructions to paving slabs in cities to monitor traffic or <mark>pollution</mark>. Gartner, a computing consultancy, reckons that by 2020 the number of connected devices in the world could run to 21 billion.</P><P class=""xhead"">Never mind the quality, feel the bulk</P><P>The processors needed to make the internet of things happen will need to be as cheap as possible, says Dr Yeric. They will have to be highly energy-efficient, and ideally able to dispense with batteries, harvesting energy from their surroundings, perhaps in the form of vibrations or ambient electromagnetic waves. They will need to be able to communicate, both with each other and with the internet at large, using tiny amounts of power and in an extremely crowded radio spectrum. What they will not need is the latest high-tech specification. “I suspect most of the chips that power the internet of things will be built on much older, cheaper production lines,” says Dr Yeric.</P><P>Churning out untold numbers of low-cost chips to turn dumb objects into smart ones will be a big, if unglamorous, business. At the same time, though, the vast amount of data thrown off by the internet of things will boost demand for the sort of cutting-edge chips that firms such as Intel specialise in. According to Dr Yeric, “if we really do get sensors everywhere, you could see a single engineering company—say Rolls Royce [a British manufacturer of turbines and jet engines]—having to deal with more data than the whole of YouTube does today.”</P><P>Increasingly, though, those chips will sit not in desktops but in the data centres that make up the rapidly growing computing “cloud”. The firms involved keep their financial cards very close to their chests, but making those high-spec processors is Intel’s most profitable business. Goldman Sachs, a big investment bank, reckons that cloud computing grew by 30% last year and will keep on expanding at that rate at least until 2018.</P><P>The scramble for that market could upend the industry’s familiar structure. Big companies that crunch a lot of numbers, such as Facebook and Amazon, already design their own data centres, but they buy most of their hardware off the shelf from firms such as Intel and Cisco, which makes routers and networking equipment. Microsoft, a software giant, has started designing chips of its own. Given the rapid growth in the size of the market for cloud computing, other software firms may soon follow.</P><P>The twilight of Moore’s law, then, will bring change, disorder and plenty of creative destruction. An industry that used to rely on steady improvements in a handful of devices will splinter. Software firms may begin to dabble in hardware; hardware makers will have to tailor their offerings more closely to their customers’ increasingly diverse needs. But, says Dr Colwell, remember that consumers do not care about Moore’s law per se: “Most of the people who buy computers don’t even know what a transistor does.” They simply want the products they buy to keep getting ever better and more useful. In the past, that meant mostly going for exponential growth in speed. That road is beginning to run out. But there will still be plenty of other ways to make better computers.</P></DIV></SECTION></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

With the Athlon 64, AMD led consumers to 64-bit processing, and the company led the charge <A href=""http://www.amd.com/us/press-releases/Pages/Press_Release_89872.aspx"" target=""_blank"">to dual-core processors</A> shortly thereafter. And when AMD bought ATI in 2006 for $5.4 billion, it didn't merely acquire a graphics card business and some talented employees, but a host of new markets as well: smartphone graphics, <A href=""http://www.polygon.com/2012/7/24/3180484/amd-bob-feldstein-xbox-720-ps4-wii-u-hired-nvidia/in/2361164"">game console graphics</A>, and the ability to build a new type of hybrid CPU-GPU processor that AMD dubbed the &quot;Fusion APU.&quot; AMD put chips into the Xbox 360, the Nintendo Wii, and <A href=""http://www.engadget.com/2006/09/12/the-wait-is-over-dell-launches-amd-desktops/"" target=""_blank"">a host of Dell computers</A>.</P><P>It was the heyday of AMD, but not the only period of prosperity in recent years. In late 2009, AMD managed to obtain <A target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.engadget.com/2009/12/11/intel-forks-over-the-1-25-billion-settlement-to-amd-apparently/"">a $1.25 billion settlement from Intel </A>over anti-competitive practices, and launched GPUs <A target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/2937"">which all but leapfrogged</A> rival Nvidia. In 2010, Sony starting putting AMD chips into VAIO systems, and in 2011, Apple tapped AMD for graphics in both laptops and desktops. After three years of <A target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.engadget.com/2008/07/23/amds-atom-killer-roadmap-confuses-even-itself/"">denying any interest</A> in the netbook market, AMD swooped in hard, finally launching those AMD Fusion APUs in a variety of inexpensive laptops and selling millions and <A href=""http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/28/amd-ships-five-million-fusion-chips-says-its-sold-out/"">millions</A>. In the desktop market, Intel's Core 2 and Core i series managed to keep a performance edge, but they allowed AMD to compete at lower price points and typically offer more cores for the money.</P><P>However, the days when AMD was firing on all cylinders are slipping away. The question is why.</P><H2>PC industry decline</H2><P>AMD management primarily blames the macroeconomic situation, which roughly translates to &quot;the PC industry isn't doing as well as it used to.&quot; Whether due to a global recession, or component shortages from <A href=""http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/5/2540403/thailand-flood-disaster"" target=""_blank"">flooding in Thailand</A>, or people putting more money towards tablets and smartphones, there's a number of factors in play... not to mention a drop in spending leading up to the launch of Windows 8, where consumers and companies may have been waiting to buy computers so their purchase wouldn't become obsolete. AMD's management is right to point out these industry-wide setbacks. But that isn't the whole story.</P><H2>Execution woes</H2><P>Primarily, AMD has stumbled, repeatedly, during recent attempts to combat Intel. The company released a host of products, each with an unfortunate issue. While AMD's Opteron server processors may feature <A href=""http://www.theverge.com/2012/11/12/3635092/titan-worlds-fastest-supercomputer-top500"">in the fastest supercomputer in the world</A>, AMD's Bulldozer architecture for those chips failed to impress in either the server or <A href=""http://www.theverge.com/2011/10/12/2485139/amds-8-core-fx-cpus-get-official-starting-at-205"">the consumer desktop realm</A>. When Nvidia popularized switchable graphics in notebooks, AMD couldn't piece together a compelling competing solution quickly enough. <Q class=""left"">Several missed passes in a row</Q> When the company shipped its Llano chips, they didn't sell well, partly because they required a new motherboard chipset that AMD didn't allocate properly. As a result, <A href=""http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/19/3170455/amd-q2-results-are-in-net-income-down-to-37m-revenue-down-11-percent/in/2361164"">the company has a huge surplus of Llano</A>, which it can't easily sell because the successor platform, Trinity, is already on the market. AMD's Trinity is in trouble too, though. It wasn't ready in time to compete with Intel's Ivy Bridge, so notebook manufacturers designed the current wave of thin laptops and Windows 8 systems <A href=""http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/6/3067528/amd-intel-competition-report-computex-2012/in/2361164"">with Intel in mind</A>, and AMD more of an afterthought.</P><H2>Intel dominance</H2><P>Meanwhile, while AMD hasn't been able to execute properly, Intel is a well-oiled machine. The company's not merely coming out with chip after chip on its famous &quot;tick-tock&quot; cadence (re-design, then shrink) but actually adding new technology each and every year. With Ivy Bridge, the company improved its integrated graphics, encroaching on AMD's APU turf, while keeping CPU performance far enough ahead <A href=""http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/19/3030483/amd-trinity-a10-4600m-review-roundup/in/2361164"">to keep Trinity looking like the underdog</A>. In case you're curious, Trinity still seems to be ahead in graphics performance and battery life, but crucially, not both at the same time. Reportedly, that integrated GPU is rather power-hungry. Intel also incentivizes manufacturers to use its own chips, of course, providing <A href=""http://newsroom.intel.com/community/intel_newsroom/blog/2011/08/10/intel-capital-creates-300-million-ultrabook-fund"">hundreds of millions of dollars</A> in marketing and design assistance for its <A href=""http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/16/3024337/ultrabook-sleekbook-editorial"">ultrabook standard</A>, while AMD won't or can't afford that kind of effort.</P><H2>Branding confusion</H2><P>AMD dismantled all of its old branding over the past couple of years, getting rid of the ATI moniker entirely in 2010, and replacing the Athlon, Phenom and Sempron lines with a series of alphanumerics like C-50, Z-60 and A8-3850 instead. Since then, the company's pursued branding initiatives like &quot;AMD Vision&quot; and built a series of buzzwords and product codenames that are even more difficult to follow than the CPU and GPU brands we've already listed. Intel naming schemes aren't exactly consumer-friendly either, but they make a certain degree of sense, while AMD traded names that people knew for ones that felt arbitrary by contrast.</P><H2>Leadership struggles</H2><P>AMD's management team has been in flux for quite a while. CEO Hector Ruiz <A href=""http://www.engadget.com/2008/07/17/hector-ruiz-steps-down-as-amd-ceo/"" target=""_blank"">stepped down in July 2008</A> in the middle of a series of layoffs, and was later implicated in an insider trading scandal that caused him to step down from AMD spin-off Globalfoundries <A href=""http://www.engadget.com/2009/11/02/ex-amd-ceo-hector-ruiz-steps-down-as-globalfoundries-chairman-am/"">in late 2009</A>. In January 2010, the board of directors <A href=""http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/11/wsj-amds-meyer-lacked-vision-ousted-accordingly/"" target=""_blank"">ousted CEO Dirk Meyer</A> because he didn't have an aggressive enough vision when it came to tablets and mobile devices. CFO Thomas Siefert was acting CEO for seven months until a replacement was found. <A href=""http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/17/amd-cfo-thomas-seifert-resigns/"" target=""_blank"">Siefert resigned in September</A>, CFO once again, and he took a chunk of AMD's share price with him. Former Lenovo President and COO Rory Read took over as CEO in August of last year. The rapid turnover can't have inspired confidence in the company, but there's more to it than that.</P><P><Q class=""center"">&quot;Ignoring&quot; the netbook platform since two-thousand eight </Q></P><P>We've heard rumblings from inside AMD that the collapse has been like a chain of dominoes ever since Dirk Meyer left, particularly since it was Meyer who<A href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/4123/what-a-day-amds-ceo-dirk-meyer-resigns"" target=""_blank""> was credited</A> with the company's return to profitability a few years back. The company has been in <A href=""http://www.forbes.com/2007/05/14/amd-debt-spansion-markets-equity-cx_af_0514markets16.html"" target=""_blank"">billions of dollars of debt</A> since the $5.4 billion ATI purchase, and <A href=""http://www.engadget.com/2007/12/12/amd-admits-to-overpaying-for-ati-will-take-unspecified-charge/"" target=""_blank"">AMD later admitted</A> that it overpaid for the graphics firm. Under Meyer, the company spun off Globalfoundries, and sold off businesses, including <A href=""http://www.engadget.com/2008/08/25/amd-selling-its-tv-chip-unit-to-broadcom-for-a-cool-192-8-milli/"">a digital TV chip business to Broadcom</A> and its <A href=""http://www.engadget.com/2009/01/20/amd-sells-handheld-graphics-unit-to-qualcomm-for-64m/"" target=""_blank"">mobile graphics business to Qualcomm</A>.</P><P>However, a source within AMD tells us that while Meyer was good for the company, he was indeed complacent, and in a rather public way. <A href=""http://www.engadget.com/2008/11/14/amd-says-its-ignoring-netbooks-will-focus-on-ultraportables/"" target=""_blank"">In 2008</A>, Meyer said AMD was &quot;ignoring the netbook platform,&quot;  and the company wound up late on the scene. Qualcomm also turned that mobile graphics business into the Adreno graphics part of its profitable Snapdragon platform (and recently <A href=""http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/21/3034603/amd-cto-eric-demers-qualcomm"" target=""_blank"">hired away AMD's Eric Demers</A> to run it) after AMD sold it for a (relative) song, but perhaps hindsight is 20/20.</P><P>However, that same AMD insider says it was a lack of a leader, not just a lack of leadership, that led to AMD's stumbles. While he characterized Rory Read as a zealot on a crusade — pushing out AMD's old guard in favor of like-minded individuals blindly marching towards <mark>innovation</mark>s like <A href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/5505/amd-the-flexibility-is-in-the-fabric"" target=""_blank"">modular chips</A> — he doesn't blame Read for most of the issues that AMD has seen. <Q class=""right"">&quot;lots of people just floating in a purgatory place&quot; </Q>Rather, there were &quot;disconnects with leadership&quot; due to the seven-month gap between Meyer's ousting and the time Read arrived at AMD. Our source characterized it as &quot;lots of people just floating in a purgatory place.&quot; The AMD insider believes that AMD's current strategy to focus more on the server, embedded and gaming markets is actually a good idea, and talked up the company's work on building modular chips, but believes that AMD might not last long enough to realize those goals without a better short-term plan.</P><H2>The cash crunch</H2><P>Last month, analysts had the same worry. <A target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-25/amd-faces-looming-cash-crunch-amid-quest-for-new-markets-tech.html"">They cited AMD's shrinking cash compared to its expenses and over $2 billion in remaining debt</A>, but both the company and other analysts insist that there are still options. Though AMD has fully spun out Globalfoundries, it still has a symbiotic relationship with the company due to its orders of chips, and it may have the power to renegotiate its contracts since Globalfoundries would be adversely affected if AMD had issues. Sterne Agee analyst Vijay Rakesh also issued an investor note this week suggesting (among other things) that AMD could sell or leaseback its campus, and that AMD could sell or license some of an estimated (by Sterne Agee) $2.2 billion worth of patents in order to raise money.</P><H2>Getting back in the saddle</H2><P>In some ways, that gets us right back where we started, though: AMD weighing difficult options including selling off important assets — intellectual property — that it claims will be critical for future business strategies. AMD wants to lead the market for microservers <A href=""http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/30/3576560/arm-cortex-a57-cortex-a53-cpu-core"">using new 64-bit ARM cores</A>, and offer up pick-what-you-like custom chips for embedded applications in the long term. How does AMD turn things around until those businesses can take off?</P><P>Nathan Brookwood, an analyst at semiconductor consulting firm Insight 64, said that it might just require running the traditional business without mistakes for a while. &quot;The execution miscues, it's like watching the Raiders game the other day. Just when you think it's going to be there, there's an interception,&quot; he told <I>The Verge</I>. &quot;What AMD really needs to do over the next several quarters is to execute without mistakes, and if so there's a clear opportunity for them to regain some of their physical health,&quot; he said.</P><P>The last time AMD was in dire straits, Brookwood recalled, an acquisition was what got the company out. In 1995, when its Pentium competitor didn't meet expectations, <A target=""_blank"" href=""http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-21/business/fi-59417_1_chip-maker-amd"">AMD bought Nexgen</A> to acquire talent that helped it design future processors. If AMD plans to do more with ARM processors, that strategy might already be helping them again: In August, <A target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/1/3212406/jim-keller-joins-amd-vp-chief-architect/in/2361164"">AMD brought back Jim Keller</A>, who led development of the Apple A4 and A5 SOCs. Also, though many people have left, it's not like the company is running out of people. AMD still has around 10,000 employees. It's a big firm.</P><P>Brookwood also told us that while he takes executives at their word that they aren't actively looking for a buyer, he believes AMD has some definite value to the right company. There's some speculation that AMD would be difficult for another company to purchase because of Intel lawyers, who would take it as an opportunity to <A target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.engadget.com/2009/03/16/intel-threatens-amd-with-termination-of-x86-license-within-60-d/"">terminate the special x86 license</A> that allows AMD to produce chips. Brookwood pointed out that Intel also relies on a license to AMD's 64-bit extensions to produce its own processors. It's a mutually beneficial, mutually destructive relationship, and Brookwood believes it could protect any theoretical buyer of the company.</P><P>So now, we wait and see whether AMD can deliver compelling enough products, soon enough, to get it out of this ditch... or if some benefactor decides it wants to compete with Intel and Nvidia by paying for the privilege.</P></DIV><SECTION class=""c-simple-link-list c-simple-link-list-stream""><H2 class=""p-breaker-head""><SPAN class=""p-breaker-head__wrapper"">In this Storystream</SPAN></H2></SECTION></DIV></DIV></SECTION></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"

Despite the existence of various best practices of effective water use (defined here as “water-wise options”), they are not widely adopted by farmers owing to high initial costs of investment and lack of the necessary knowledge and skills of a new generation of farmers after the Soviet era. For assessing the potential of several water-wise techniques, key indicators such as water use reduction rate (WURR), economic efficiency (EE), and financial viability (FV) were combined with expert surveys. A SWOT procedure was used to analyze the (dis)advantages, opportunities and constraints of adopting the selected water-wise methods. Results show that the examined options have substantial potential for increasing water use efficiency under promising EE. The various recommendations aim at improving the sustainability of irrigation water use.</DIV></SECTION><DIV id=""html-keywords""><DIV class=""html-gwd-group""><DIV id=""html-keywords-title"">Keywords:</DIV>
    Khorezm region; financial viability; water use efficiency; SWOT; Uzbekistan</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""html-body""><SECTION id=""1Introduction"" type=""intro""><H2 data-nested=""1"">  1. Introduction</H2><DIV class=""html-p"">The Khorezm region of Uzbekistan, located in the lower basin of the Amu Darya river, is representative of about 8 million hectares (Mha) irrigated lowlands in Central Asia [<A href=""#B1-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">1</A>]. Its geographical location at the tail end of the water supply network often does not allow the demand for irrigation, drinking and industrial water to be satisfied in time and space. Since the economy of Khorezm heavily relies on irrigated agriculture, water scarcity directly threatens the income security and livelihood of the rural population and regional welfare. This was evidenced on several occasions during the last decade. Based on an analysis of long-term data, Müller [<A href=""#B2-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">2</A>] estimated that the probability for the farming population to receive sufficient water decreased from 82% in 1982 to presently not more than 75%. Forecastings of water supply and the water use by the upstream countries Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan, predict an even lower discharge of Amu Darya water in the near future [<A href=""#B3-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">3</A>]. Moreover, given the anticipated population growth (about 2.5% annually), and the increasing demand for industrial water, the water demand for agriculture is very likely to increase. The agricultural sector, which uses about 95% of all water resources, can therefore contribute most to efficient water use, in particular when referring to the present low irrigation water use efficiency both on field level and in the entire system [<A href=""#B4-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">4</A>].</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">Furrow and basin irrigation are the most widespread types of irrigation water use in Central Asia; they are characterized by relatively low energy demand but high water consumption. But, if cropland is inadequately leveled, irrigation water is heterogeneously distributed on the field, which can reduce cotton yield by 25–30% compared to the potential yields [<A href=""#B5-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">5</A>]. With furrows of 250–400 m or more in length, high percolation rates, high ground water levels, soil salinity and waterlogging become common [<A href=""#B5-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">5</A>]. The estimated field level efficiency of furrow and basin irrigation practices varied between 48–55% and 40% [<A href=""#B6-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">6</A>].</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">The low water use efficiencies at both the irrigation system and field level call for the introduction of new approaches to obtain a more effective use of irrigation water resources. Assuming that only 40% of the water supplied to the fields reaches the root zone, there seems to be much scope for improving water use in the lower reaches of the Amu Darya. In addition, water efficient practices at the field level reduce the present high pumping and energy costs via indirect water saving in the conveyance system. In contrast, the rehabilitation of canals by lining requires capital investments as high as 1,200 $/ha [<A href=""#B7-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">7</A>], which is currently not affordable to farmers.</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">This study investigates a number of <mark>innovation</mark>s or “best water use practices” to increase water productivity, which are defined here as “water-wise options”. Water-wise <mark>innovation</mark>s are options to reduce water losses, maintaining or increasing production (more crop per drop) and increasing water use efficiency in general, and in particular at the field level. Considering the demand for efficient water use on the one side and financial restrictions on the other side, the main objective of the paper is to provide guidelines to farmers and decision makers on water efficient practices by evaluating the technical feasibility and economic efficiency of different water-wise options and <mark>innovation</mark>s such as laser-guided land leveling, drip irrigation, alternate dry, double, and short furrows at the field level in Khorezm. Given the present low level of farm capital, it cannot be expected that the farming population will adopt water-wise options just because they could be beneficial to the environment. To increase the opportunities for an adoption of water-wise practices, these need to be financially feasible, ecologically <mark>sustainable</mark> and match the sociological context. Given the present low linkages between farmers and markets, the generally poor access to capital, the high transport costs to the urban market centers, and the reduced availability of technologies, farmers in Khorezm are not in a position to experiment much. Moreover, the use of water-wise technologies demands more skills and understanding of agriculture than the present practices. Thus, this lack of expertise needs to be dealt with as well. In the past, numerous technical shortcomings have been underlined, whilst equally important is upgrading the managerial skills of the producers that have only sporadically been voiced.</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">The specific objectives of this study are therefore to (i) assess, through expert assessments, the (dis)advantages of different water-wise options; (ii) select the most feasible options given the conditions of the Khorezm region; (iii) analyze the economic efficiency of each; (iv) determine the best practices with the highest water use efficiency and the least capital requirement; and (v) evaluate the advantages, disadvantages, opportunities and constraints of adopting advanced technologies with the help of a SWOT analysis.</DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""2TechnicalSocioeconomicandInstitutionalAspectsofWaterUseintheKhorezmRegion"" type=""""><H2 data-nested=""1"">  2. Technical, Socio-economic, and Institutional Aspects of Water Use in the Khorezm Region</H2><DIV class=""html-p"">The Khorezm region is characterized by an arid <mark>climate</mark> where the annual evapo-transpiration of 1,400–1,600 mm per year by far exceeds the annual precipitation of 100 mm per year [<A href=""#B8-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">8</A>]. Rainfall occurs predominantly during the fall-winter period, thus, outside the vegetation period, which makes agriculture totally dependent on irrigation.</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">The economy of Khorezm heavily rests on agricultural production, which is evidenced by its contribution of around 45% to the Gross Regional Product [<A href=""#B9-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">9</A>]. About 70% of the 1.3 million people in the region live in rural areas, and have to cope with high unemployment rates [<A href=""#B2-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">2</A>]. About 27.5% of the rural population lives below the poverty line of 1 USD per day. The latter, however, is impacted by water availability, <mark>climate change</mark>, and pests, as well as political conditions such as an increased competition for water between the up- and the down-stream countries.</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">The Amu Darya River is the sole source of water in the region, providing about 5 km<SUP>3</SUP> of water annually, but with occasionally sharp decreases in water supply; e.g., in 2000–2001 and 2008 [<A href=""#B10-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">10</A>]. About 95% of the supplied water is used in agriculture [<A href=""#B4-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">4</A>]. In recent years, the increasing annual and seasonal fluctuations in water supply [<A href=""#B2-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">2</A>] have shown high income risks in agriculture. According to Duhovny and Sorokin [<A href=""#B11-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">11</A>] and Martius <SPAN class=""html-italic"">et al.</SPAN> [<A href=""#B12-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">12</A>], the expected increase in water demand in upstream countries Tajikistan and Afghanistan, in the near future may lead also to a decrease in water availability in the downstream regions such as Khorezm.</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">The river water is distributed to the agricultural fields through an irrigation network consisting of magistral, inter-farm and on-farm canals. Canals conveying water through different regions are defined as magistral canals. From them, water is distributed via inter-farm canals to the boundary of former collective farms and present WUAs (Water User Associations), and then delivered through on-farm canals to the field level networks [<A href=""#B13-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">13</A>]. With the exception of about 10% lined canals [<A href=""#B14-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">14</A>], the irrigation system consists of earthen canals with an efficiency of not more than 55% [<A href=""#B12-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">12</A>]. Especially at the lower hierarchy system levels, hydraulic structures are missing or dysfunctional [<A href=""#B4-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">4</A>]. Drainage is performed through a network of open ditches and collectors.</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">Reforms in agriculture have led to the appearance of a new class of thousands of private farmers instead of the previous few hundred collective farms. The social and organizational structures of the collective farming practices, including the water management, have been abolished alongside with the dismantling of the collective farms [<A href=""#B4-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">4</A>]. The appearance of multiple actors at the different levels and arenas in the water sector made water management a socio-political process [<A href=""#B15-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">15</A>] causing unequal water distribution [<A href=""#B4-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">4</A>]. On-farm irrigation and drainage infrastructure, formerly managed and maintained by collective farms, were left abandoned, making the water distribution an arena of contestation and competition [<A href=""#B16-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">16</A>,<A href=""#B17-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">17</A>].</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">The probability of receiving sufficient irrigation water is very low, especially in areas furthest from the river [<A href=""#B2-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">2</A>]. Agricultural incomes are also unequally distributed among the rural population. Gurlen, the district with a direct link to the Amu Darya, shows the highest income from agriculture, while agriculture in Kushkupir, the district with the longest distance to the river, generates the lowest income [<A href=""#B9-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">9</A>,<A href=""#B10-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">10</A>]. Unequal water distribution results in growing—human-made—water scarcity at the tail end of the irrigation system and leads to frequent crop failures [<A href=""#B17-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">17</A>,<A href=""#B18-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">18</A>]. The environmental consequences have been growing salinity, waterlogging, desertification, drying of lakes and decline in biodiversity at the tail end of irrigation systems [<A href=""#B18-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">18</A>]. Poor knowledge of farmers, misguided policies and constraints in technology adoption are considered to be factors influencing land degradation in the region [<A href=""#B12-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">12</A>]. The Aral Sea catastrophe, which is believed to be a result of irrigation water over-use in Central Asia, is not only creating environmental problems, but continues to threaten the welfare of the agricultural producers through declining yields and incomes [<A href=""#B19-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">19</A>].</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">WUAs have been newly established, primarily in the territory of former <SPAN class=""html-italic"">shirkats</SPAN> [<A href=""#B20-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">20</A>], to timely supply sufficient water to users, cleaning the canals and drainages within the WUA boundaries, and maintaining the infrastructure. The organizational set-up of a WUA is that of a non-governmental (NGO) structure that should operate to the benefit of its members, <SPAN class=""html-italic"">i.e.</SPAN>, the farmers/water users. Recent studies showed, however, that these WUAs operate as state organizations [<A href=""#B21-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">21</A>,<A href=""#B22-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">22</A>] and actually are used by the state to control farmers’ activities. Therefore, the water users consider the WUAs as another water administration imposed on them, and not as a way of introducing collective-action water management.</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">Farmers do not pay directly for their water consumption, but water pricing is expected to be introduced soon in the country. The irrigation sector is still subsidized by the state; this includes the expenses of all water management organizations; only the budget of the WUA is based on fees collected from the members [<A href=""#B20-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">20</A>]. Price uncertainty is very high due to underdeveloped markets and the commodity processing sector in the region. Hence, the incentives of farmers to increase crop yields are limited.</DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""3MaterialsandMethods"" type=""""><H2 data-nested=""1"">  3.

Estimation of the Efficiency Parameters of Water-Wise Approaches</H4><DIV class=""html-p"">The potential of different water-wise <mark>innovation</mark>s—laser-guided land leveling, drip irrigation, alternate dry, double, and short furrows and others—was assessed through an expert-knowledge approach. Five experts were interviewed individually and requested to assess the <mark>innovation</mark>s based on a series of criteria [<A href=""#B6-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">6</A>] such as water use reduction rate, yield impact, financial viability, economic efficiency, adaptability to different soil-<mark>climate</mark> conditions and suitability for the crops dominating in the region. Their assessments were cross-checked with secondary data sources and averaged. The weights for each specific criterion were evaluated via focus group discussions.</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">After ranking the water-wise methods according to their average weighted value, the most promising ones were selected and assessed in a further analysis that focused on the technical and economic potential while using secondary data sources [<A href=""#B5-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">5</A>,<A href=""#B6-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">6</A>,<A href=""#B7-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">7</A>]. This resulted in four groups of water-wise options: Group A included a change of the cropping pattern such as replacing paddy rice areas with less water-consuming crops such as maize for staple production (A1) or aerobic rice (A2); Group B included options to increase soil moisture by hydrogel application (B1) or manuring practices (B2) for cotton, wheat, and potato cultivation; Group C contained options to obtain a more adequate water supply such as laser-guided land leveling (C1) for cotton and drip irrigation (C2) for tomato; Group D covered improved furrow irrigation practices, <SPAN class=""html-italic"">i.e.</SPAN>, surge flow (D1), double furrow (D2), alternate dry furrow (D3), and short furrow (D4) for cotton cultivation.</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">Hydrogel is a crystal polymer, which is applied around the roots of plants. The polymer absorbs and retains humidity up to 200-times its own dry weight, which is then slowly released for plant growth.</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">The surge flow technique uses a device supplying water in furrow by intermittence, involving a cycle of flooding and dewatering. As a consequence, a fine layer is established in the previously wetted portions of the furrows where reduced soil intake rates and improved hydraulic characteristics occur almost immediately after the initial dewatering of the soil surface. This phenomenon decreases infiltration rates and enables the water flow to the end of the furrow and field.</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">Double-sided furrow application provokes a better irrigation of the fields. Since water is applied from both sites of the same furrow, a better uniformity of the water applied over the entire length of the furrow is obtained. In the case of Alternate Dry Furrow (ADF) only each second furrow is irrigated.</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">Changed values of water use as well as decreased or increased crop yields under different options and simulations certainly bring about altered values of water productivity. Water productivity was estimated as the ratio of output or yield to total water used during irrigation. Due to high salt concentrations and consequently a dramatic decrease in yields, the re-use of drainage water is not commonly practiced in the study region, except in tail end situations and during water scarce years. Thus, the potential of using percolated water by downstream farmers is also limited and classical water use efficiency and productivity estimations can be applicable.</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">The water use reduction rate (WURR) is the ratio of the potential amount of water to be reduced by each technology at field level to the water application amount under conventional practices.</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">Partial budget analysis [<A href=""#B23-water-02-00200"" class=""html-bibr"">23</A>] was employed to compare costs and benefits before and after the implementation of any water-wise option. Partial budget analyses addressed four components—Additional costs, reduced revenue, additional revenue and reduced costs. The first two components were grouped as net cost changes whereas the third and fourth components were classified as net revenue change. The difference between the net cost change and the net revenue change is the net income change due to the new technology. A value &gt; zero indicates a potential profit while values &lt; zero indicate losses, when applying the technology.</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">Initial investment requirement was taken as a measure of financial viability.</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">To rank and classify the studied water-wise options (<SPAN class=""html-italic"">t</SPAN>) according to their estimated parameters, these indicators needed to be normalized (adjusted) in relation to their maximum value.</DIV><DIV class=""html-p"">Water use reduction rate (<SPAN class=""html-italic"">WURR<SUB>t</SUB></SPAN>) was adjusted relative to a maximal value (<SPAN class=""html-italic"">WURRmax</SPAN>) according to:

Conventional Agriculture</H1></HEADER><DIV class=""entry-content""><P><STRONG>I. Introduction</STRONG></P><P>Farming has enabled human populations to dominate the world’s landscapes for many thousands of years.  The science of agriculture has been refined and perfected over time to accommodate for the ever-increasing human population.  Until recent centuries, productive crops were mostly organic and existed with some permanence as part of a landscape.  As communities grow though, less and less land is available for food production and existing crops become easily exhausted.  Food insecurity caused by rapid population growth has pressured science to step in and produce many synthetic chemicals and gene manipulation techniques to maximize the potential of plants.  In addition, agricultural production has increased tremendously worldwide over the last century.  Coupled with this growth however is the <mark>pollution</mark> and degradation of the natural environment.  Many agricultural techniques exist today, but in an effort to adjust to the exponential trends of our population without compromising the integrity of the environment it is necessary to have a global transition towards <mark>sustainable</mark> farming.  With the current population at seven billion and rising, an important question must be addressed: What is the most <mark>sustainable</mark> and cost effective way to feed the world’s population?  Fortunately humans have been perfecting agricultural methods for thousands of years, which can help to answer this question.</P><P>This paper will analyze and compare two types of farming, organic and conventional.  In a comparison of agriculture, my goal is to assess the impact and performance of each practice and then identify the best method for growing crops.  Although there are many types of agricultural practices, they can be generalized as <mark>sustainable</mark> or conventional based on the techniques used.  <mark>Sustainable</mark> / organic farming aims to produce a number of crops, without the use of synthetic chemicals or fertilizers, while enhancing soil composition and promoting biodiversity.  This is a traditional, more permanent type of farming that relies on ecosystem services to maintain the integrity of the landscape while still producing sufficient yields.  Conventional farming uses synthetic chemicals and fertilizers to maximize the yield of a particular crop or set of crops, which are typically genetically modified.  This method requires a significant amount of chemical and energy input and weakens the ecology of a landscape.  In a comparative analysis of these two techniques, it is important to highlight the fact that the crops studied differed in soil composition, geography, and rotation systems.  “To carry on extensive long-term trials for a number of crops in several different geographical areas would be of fundamental importance to understand the potential of organic farming as well as to improve farming techniques in general.” (Gomiero, Pimentel, and Paoletti 2011).  Due to the many different factors determining crop health and productivity, there is a need for much more extensive research on the subject.  Therefore, my goal in writing this paper was to use reliable, long-term research that made specific assessments of the two generalized types of farming and then compare the results.</P><P><STRONG>II. History of Agriculture</STRONG></P><P>Agriculture has played a tremendous role in the advancement of human society. Agriculture has been around since roughly 10,000 B.C.E. and has enabled humans to manipulate ecosystems and maximize population growth (<I>Xtimeline.com</I>).  The science has encouraged people to live and develop rich, permanent settlements all over the world.  When humans first discovered the potential of planting seeds, they suddenly had the ability to explore the world and establish infrastructures wherever soils were fertile.</P><P>Soon after the start of agriculture people began to select for genes that maximized plant yields.  Selective breeding was first implemented on plants over 10,000 years ago to produce desired characteristics in crops (<I>USDA.gov</I>).  This discovery further contributed to the permanence and size of settlements.  With breakthroughs in agriculture, populations increased and development spread.</P><P>Early farming techniques depended on local <mark>climate</mark> conditions, but most farmers would continue to plant on the same field year-after-year until the soils were exhausted of nutrients.  This encouraged ingenuities such as crop rotation and intercropping (<I>Economywatch.com</I>).  Intercropping is a technique in which a variety of crops are grown together, creating a micro<mark>climate</mark> that favors the survival of each plant, maximizes potential yields and maintains soil fertility (<I>Archaeology.about.com</I>).  For example, Native Americans developed an intercropping technique over 5,000 years ago called the three sisters, where maize, beans, and squash were grown together (<I>Archaeology.about.com</I>).  Maize consumes a lot of nitrogen, while beans supply nitrogen to the soil, and squash benefits from a shady, moist <mark>climate</mark>.  Intercropping is one of many early discoveries in agriculture still being implemented today that promotes biodiversity, maintains soil composition, and fortifies plant health.</P><P>Techniques such as irrigation, intercropping, and crop rotation have progressively increased efficiency in agriculture.  Over the last few centuries however, radical changes have been made in farming and many countries have made a shift toward conventional methods.  Factors such as growing populations, economic instability, <mark>climate change</mark>, and pressures from companies to produce higher yields have contributed to this shift.  However, adopting these conventional methods subjects farmers to the greed of industry, as their crops depend on a high input of energy, synthetic chemicals, and genetically modified organisms.  And once committed to the conventional practices, farmers find themselves locked in a perpetual cycle of loans, subsidies, and debt.</P><P><B>III.  Conventional Agriculture</B></P><P>Conventional agriculture is a broad term that has a number of definitions, but a crop can be classified as conventional if synthetic chemicals are used to maintain the plants.  A significant amount of chemical and energy input is required in conventional agriculture to produce the highest possible yield of crops.  “This method usually alters the natural environment, deteriorates soil quality, and eliminates biodiversity.” (<I>USDA.gov</I>).   Conventional agriculture was developed to make farming more efficient, but achieves that efficiency at a major cost to the environment.</P><P>The goal of conventional agriculture is to maximize the potential yield of crops.  This is achieved through the application of synthetic chemicals, genetically modified organisms, and a number of other industrial products.  In maintaining a conventional system, biodiversity, soil fertility, and ecosystems health are compromised (Huntley, Collins, and Swisher).  Production of these crops is beneficial to nothing but food security and economy.  Once established, a conventional farm requires constant maintenance but produces maximal yields.</P><P>Maintenance is made easy for farmers as conventional farming typically involves monocropping, but is also very expensive.  In a conventional system farmers will designate entire fields to just one crop, which creates uniformity.  Uniformity can determine both the success and failure of conventional systems.  A uniform crop is ideal because it reduces labor costs and makes harvesting easy, but it can also impact biodiversity and make crops susceptible to pathogens (Gabriel, Salt, Kunin, and Benton 2013).  Chemicals and genetically modified organisms make maintenance of conventional systems relatively simple for farmers, but require a constant input of energy and money.  In a conventional system, farmers can apply pesticides and herbicides to crops at a much more efficient rate if they are made up of just one type of plant, but this has a number of unintended consequences.  Since the goal of conventional agriculture is to maximize yields, environmental health and biodiversity are usually not preserved.</P><P><B>IV.  <mark>Sustainable</mark> Agriculture</B></P><P>Where conventional farming represents one extreme of agriculture, <mark>sustainable</mark> farming represents the other.  “Organic agriculture is a production system that sustains the health of soils, ecosystems and people.  It relies on ecological processes, biodiversity and cycles adapted to local conditions, rather than the use of inputs with adverse effects.  Organic agriculture combines tradition, <mark>innovation</mark> and science to benefit the shared environment and promote fair relationships and a good quality of life for all involved.” (Gomiero, Pimentel, and Paoletti 2011).  <mark>Sustainable</mark> agriculture is a more holistic approach to farming than conventional in that it relies on ecosystem services and is typically much less detrimental to the surrounding landscape.  <mark>Sustainable</mark> agriculture is a natural way to produce food and has a number of social, economic, and environmental benefits.</P><P>There are many types of <mark>sustainable</mark> farming that all rely on natural cycles to ensure plant health and crop performance.  <mark>Sustainable</mark> farming forgoes the use of synthetic pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers to produce food.  Instead, farmers will plant a variety of plants together to promote biodiversity and ward off pests and pathogens (Nicholls and Altieri 2012).  Where conventional systems promote uniformity and depend on synthetic chemicals for protection against disease and pests, <mark>sustainable</mark> systems rely on biodiversity as a measure to protect against these things.</P><P><mark>Sustainable</mark> agriculture profits farmers, economies, and food banks while existing symbiotically with the landscape.  One example of many in <mark>sustainable</mark> farming practices, which emphasizes economic benefits and environmental health, is conservation agriculture.  “By increasing soil organic matter contents and moisture-holding capacity, CA can double subsistence crop yields in areas where use of fertilizers is uneconomic and it can sustain production in years with low rainfall.” (Kassam and Brammer 2013).  Conservation agriculture underlines the focus of <mark>sustainable</mark> agriculture in that it focuses on producing high yields without compromising the integrity of the environment.</P><P><B>V.  A Comparison of Agriculture</B></P><P>In a comparison of conventional and <mark>sustainable</mark> agriculture there should be several points of focus: production, biodiversity, soil composition / erosion, water use, energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions.  The environmental impact and production levels of each method will determine its overall viability as a solution to growing trends.  It is necessary to make these comparisons in order to identify the best agricultural method that can sustainably meet the needs of the current population.  Although these comparisons are based off of scientific data, there is much more research that needs to be done in order to make a definitive judgment.</P><P>To meet the needs of the current population requires a tremendous amount of resources.  Not taking into account the environmental damage associated with intense production, conventional agriculture is a feasible way to provide for more people; “… population growth and increasing consumption of calorie- and meat-intensive diets are expected to roughly double human food demand by 2050.” (Mueller, Gerber, Johnston, Ray, Ramankutty, and Foley 2012).  In addressing this rapid growth, production levels become a serious point of comparison.  “Organic yields are globally on average 25% lower than conventional yields according to a recent meta-analysis, although this varies with crop types and species and depends on the comparability of farming systems.” (Gabriel, Salt, Kunin, and Benton 2013).  Most research indicates that <mark>sustainable</mark> crops produce much less than conventional systems.</P><P>There are many environmental benefits associated with <mark>sustainable</mark> agriculture, but its production capacity is limited.  In general, <mark>sustainable</mark> agriculture fails to match up to conventional agriculture in terms of production.  This result varies though, and in some instances organic crops actually best conventional crops.  For example, under drought conditions organic crops tend to produce higher yields because they typically retain more water; “As part of the Rodale Institute Farming System Trial (from 1981 to 2002), Pimentel <I>et al.</I>, (2005) found that during 1999, a year of extreme drought, (with total rainfall between April and August of 224 mm, compared with an average of 500 mm) the organic animal system had significantly higher corn yield (1,511 kg per ha) than either organic legume (412 kg per ha) or the conventional (1,100 kg per ha).” (Gomiero, Pimentel, and Paoletti 2011).  Although certain conditions may favor organic crops, conventional agriculture is designed to produce the highest yields possible.</P><P>Many factors contribute to this difference in production.  Conventional crops are designed specifically to produce maximal yields; therefore, the difference should be expected.  Typically conventional crops are genetically modified to perform better under certain conditions than <mark>sustainable</mark> crops (Carpenter 2011).  However, these crops are also sprayed with toxic pesticides and herbicides to make up for their uniformity.  Some research has been done to determine whether increased biodiversity is related to increased yields; “…farmland biodiversity is typically negatively related to crop yield; generally, organic farming <EM>per se</EM> does not have an effect other than via reducing yields and therefore increasing biodiversity.” (Gabriel, Salt, Kunin, and Benton 2013).  Although levels of production are reduced in <mark>sustainable</mark> agriculture, studies show that higher levels of biodiversity are linked to healthier crops.</P><P>Biodiversity plays a large part in this comparison because it is a determinant of agricultural health and performance.  The greater the biodiversity, the more immune plants are to pests and disease (Gomiero, Pimentel, and Paoletti 2011).  This is important to highlight because conventional agriculture discourages biodiversity and instead relies on synthetic chemicals to maintain crop health.  Over 940 million pounds of pesticides are being applied annually with only 10% of that reaching the desired target, a number that could be greatly reduced if conventional agriculture were to implement <mark>sustainable</mark> alternatives (<I><mark>Sustainable</mark>lafayette.org</I>).  Techniques such as integrated pest management and intercropping could be applied to conventional systems and in turn promote biodiversity.</P><P>High biodiversity is important to <mark>sustainable</mark> farming because it enhances the performance of the ecological cycles that the crops depend upon.  Organic agricultural systems are typically much more rich in nutrients and diverse in organisms than conventional systems; “…organic farming is usually associated with a significantly higher level of biological activity, represented by bacteria, fungi, springtails, mites and earthworms, due to its versatile crop rotations, reduced applications of nutrients, and the ban on pesticides.” (Gomiero, Pimentel, and Paoletti 2011).  It is important to encourage high nutrient levels and biodiversity as these two factors contribute significantly to the health of the crops and the landscape.  Although biodiversity does not directly determine crop yield, it does play a major role in the health and permanence of <mark>sustainable</mark> farms.</P><P>Despite the impacts conventional methods have on agricultural land, not all conventional farms degrade biodiversity.  In fact, there are many ways farmers can reduce the amount of chemicals and energy they use by implementing low input alternatives; “Overall, the review finds that currently commercialized GM crops have reduced the impacts of agriculture on biodiversity, through enhanced adoption of conservation tillage practices, reduction of insecticide use and use of more environmentally benign herbicides and increasing yields to alleviate pressure to convert additional land into agricultural use.” (Carpenter 2011).  The global impact agriculture has can be significantly reduced if conventional farmers adopt <mark>sustainable</mark> techniques.</P><P>In addition to higher levels of biodiversity, <mark>sustainable</mark> farming is typically associated with better soil quality.  Organic farms have stronger soil ecology because they promote biodiversity rather than uniformity; “The results confirm that higher levels of total and organic C, total N and soluble organic C are observed in all of the organic soil.” (Wang, Li, and Fan 2012).  The increased concentrations of these nutrients can be contributed to the depth of the food web and amount of biomass in <mark>sustainable</mark> systems.  “In a seven-year experiment in Italy, Marinari <I>et al.</I> (2006) compared two adjacent farms, one organic and one conventional, and found that the fields under organic management showed significantly better soil nutritional and microbiological conditions; with an increased level of total nitrogen, nitrate and available phosphorus, and an increased microbial biomass content, and enzymatic activities.” (Gomiero, Pimentel, and Paoletti 2011).  <mark>Sustainable</mark> crops are more permanent than conventional crops because they work in harmony with the landscape rather than drain it of nutrients and biomass.</P><P>Soil management is vital for existing farms because agricultural production is increasing globally and land is becoming less available to accommodate this growth.  Conventional systems can improve soil quality by practicing <mark>sustainable</mark> methods like no-tillage farming, agroforestry, and integrated pest management, but <mark>sustainable</mark> agriculture is the most effective form of food production in terms of maintaining soil conditions.  “Establishing trees on agricultural land can help to mitigate many of the negative impacts of agriculture, for example by regulating soil, water and air quality, supporting biodiversity, reducing inputs by natural regulation of pests and more efficient nutrient cycling, and by modifying local and global <mark>climate</mark>s.” (Smith, Pearce, and Wolfe 2012).  Again, research shows that an increase in biodiversity and a reduction of chemical input can result in conventional farms with more healthy soils and improved crop performance.</P><P>A major problem concerning agriculture is soil erosion caused by nutrient loss, run-off, salinity, and drought.  Soil erosion presents a threat to the growth of agriculture because, “Intensive farming exacerbates these phenomena, which are threatening the future sustainability of crop production on a global scale, especially under extreme climatic events such as droughts.” (Gomiero, Pimentel, and Paoletti 2011).  Organic systems enhance soil composition as well as prevent soil erosion due to the greater amount of plant material and biomass in the soil.  Conventional systems manipulate the landscape rather than adapt to it; “…soils under organic management showed &lt;75% soil loss compared to the maximum tolerance value in the region (the maximum rate of soil erosion that can occur without compromising long-term crop productivity or environmental quality −11.2 t ha<SUP>−1</SUP> yr<SUP>−1</SUP>), while in conventional soil a rate of soil loss three times the maximum tolerance value was recorded.” (Gomiero, Pimentel, and Paoletti 2011).  Compared to <mark>sustainable</mark> farming, conventional crops are terribly inefficient at maintaining the integrity of agricultural landscapes.  Conventional agriculture is therefore unable meet the demands of the growing populations without consuming a substantial amount of land and non-renewable resources.</P><P>On a global scale, water is a renewable resource that can meet the needs of our current population.  Locally, however, water is a scarce resource and must be appropriated efficiently.  The amount of fresh water available for consumption globally is small, but regional constraints make accessing that water even more difficult for many millions of people.  Agriculture accounts for approximately 70% of water use worldwide (<I>USDA.gov</I>).  Increasing demand for fresh water is pressuring global stocks.  To conserve this resource a drastic overhaul of water saving techniques, especially in agriculture, must occur.</P><P>Due to the abundance of flora and fauna in <mark>sustainable</mark> systems, organic soil typically retains much more water than conventional soil.  This increased retention rate enables <mark>sustainable</mark> agricultural systems to produce much higher yields than conventional systems during drought conditions (Gomiero, Pimentel, and Paoletti 2011).  This is a desirable characteristic in agricultural land as it allows crops to be more tolerable to changing <mark>climate</mark>.  “In heavy loess soils in a temperate <mark>climate</mark> in Switzerland water holding capacity was reported being 20 to 40% higher in organically managed soils than in conventional ones… The primary reason for higher yield in organic crops is thought to be due to the higher water-holding capacity of the soils under organic management.” (Gomiero, Pimentel, and Paoletti 2011).  To manage available water resources, <mark>sustainable</mark> agriculture is the more efficient approach to feeding the world.</P><P>A gap exists between current production rates and potential production rates of crops.  Through better management of water and soil, much greater yields can be produced.  Increasing efficiency to 100% is not entirely feasible, but implementing <mark>sustainable</mark> farming techniques would conserve resources and improve crop performance; “Globally, we find that closing yield gaps to 100% of attainable yields could increase worldwide crop production by 45% to 70% for most major crops (with 64%, 71% and 47% increases for maize, wheat and rice, respectively).” (Mueller, Gerber, Johnston, Ray, Ramankutty, and Foley 2012).  Meeting future food demands is a dynamic problem that requires consideration of all things, but most importantly water and soil conservation.</P><P><mark>Sustainable</mark> agriculture relies solely on natural processes for input and recycles nutrients on-site to eliminate the use of non-renewable resources.  Alternatively, conventional agriculture requires an incredible amount of energy to produce, prepare, and transport food.  Energy efficiency is important to agriculture as it can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lower costs of production; “Agricultural activities (not including forest conversion) account for approximately 5% of anthropogenic emissions of CO<SUB>2</SUB> and the 10–12% of total global anthropogenic emissions of GHGs (5.1 to 6.1 Gt CO<SUB>2</SUB> eq. yr<SUP>−1</SUP> in 2005), accounting for nearly all the anthropogenic methane and one to two thirds of all anthropogenic nitrous oxide emissions are due to agricultural activities.” (Gomiero, Pimentel, and Paoletti 2011).  Agriculture is responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions, but can also mitigate this impact using <mark>sustainable</mark> methods.  Better management of agricultural land is required to reduce the effects of crop production.</P><P><mark>Sustainable</mark> agriculture has the ability to offset global greenhouse emissions at a greater rate than conventional agriculture because it is more permanent and does not require much input to produce food.  Conventional systems are inefficient at capturing <mark>carbon</mark> because of soil composition, constant production, and how much energy is being used to maintain the crops.  “We use so much machinery, pesticides, irrigation, processing, and transportation that for every calorie that comes to the table, 10 calories or energy have been expended.” (<I><mark>Sustainable</mark>lafayette.org</I>).  However, there are measures that can be taken to increase energy efficiency.  “This <mark>carbon</mark> can be stored in soil by SOM and by aboveground biomass through processes such as adopting rotations with cover crops and green manures to increase SOM, agroforestry, and conservation-tillage systems.” (Gomiero, Pimentel, and Paoletti 2011).  Conventional agriculture operates at a net energy loss, but implementing <mark>sustainable</mark> practices can reduce costs and benefit the surrounding landscape.</P><P><mark>Sustainable</mark> agriculture aims to enhance the composition of a landscape while producing sufficient yields.  This method is so efficient compared to conventional agriculture because it requires no input of synthetic chemicals or fertilizers, which accounts for a large amount of the greenhouse gas emissions.  However, energy efficiency also takes into account the ratio of input to output.  In that sense, there is no substantial difference between the two types of agriculture; “…the energy efficiency, calculated as the yield divided by the energy use (MJ ha<SUP>−1</SUP>), was generally higher in the organic system than in the conventional system, but the yields were also lower. This meant that conventional crop production had the highest net energy production, whereas organic crop production had the highest energy efficiency.” (Gomiero, Pimentel, and Paoletti 2011).  Even though conventional systems produce greater yields than <mark>sustainable</mark> systems, organic crop production is the most energy efficient method.</P><P><B>VI.  Conclusion</B></P><P>Studies point toward <mark>sustainable</mark> agriculture as the best solution to managing the growing population.  Although the benefits of <mark>sustainable</mark> agriculture are abundant, there are several constraints to adopting this method worldwide.  <mark>Climate</mark> conditions vary with geography so where <mark>sustainable</mark> agriculture is the most efficient system in one part of the world, it may not be entirely feasible in another.  “Some authors suggest the adoption of integrated farming, rather than upholding solely organic practices, which they find more harmful than conventional farming, for instance in the case of pest control technologies.” (Gomiero, Pimentel, and Paoletti 2011).  Many factors determine the performance of agricultural methods and often the most effective type of agriculture requires a combination of techniques.  In addition to local constraints, <mark>sustainable</mark> agriculture also requires much more labor to maintain crops.</P><P>The science of agriculture has allowed human populations to grow exponentially and dominate the world’s landscapes.  Advancements in this science have enabled humans to manipulate entire ecosystems to cater to their survival.  But as populations continue to grow, resources are becoming limited.  Water, fuel, and soil are three important factors determining the survival the world’s population and it is crucial that they are used as efficiently as possible.  In a comparison of <mark>sustainable</mark> and conventional agriculture, organic farming methods are shown to perform much better for a number of indicators.  <mark>Sustainable</mark> agriculture consumes less water and energy, enhances soil composition, and forgoes synthetic chemical input.  Conventional agriculture cannot meet the needs of the current population without compromising the integrity of the environment.  <mark>Sustainable</mark> agriculture has the potential to sequester <mark>carbon</mark>, feed the world, and enrich the environment.  The social, economic, and environmental benefits of this system are reasons why <mark>sustainable</mark> agriculture is the most viable way to accommodate growing trends.</P><P><STRONG>VII.  References</STRONG></P><OL><LI>Gomiero, T.; Pimentel, D.; Paoletti, M.

For the most budget-conscious, AMD has a line of CPUs called APU which are actually CPU + integrated graphics processor. For example, AMD A8 7600 is a quad core CPU with built-in low-end gaming GPU already embedded in the same CPU die, no need for buying separate graphics card. If you buy an Intel solution or even AMD FX chip, not only is it expensive but you will still need to purchase additional GPU. The main drawback of APU is #1 that they can only compare with skylake Pentium or perhaps i3 in terms of processing power, which really is not bad for everyday tasks or even most games… #2 don’t expect to be able to upgrade the graphics, you are stuck with whatever is on the CPU #3 you are stuck on DDR3 RAM until the next generation of motherboards are developed (Zen). Main advantage is you will be saving so much money. But you will probably die waiting for process to finish if you use it for modeling nuclear explosions or the weather.</P></SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Sure, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple are going gang-busters right now, but that only reinforces thoughts of soon-to-be-realized-super-heated-bubble drama.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P class=""p p1"">“<STRONG>The growth is astounding – the aggregate market capitalization of all digital currencies excluding Bitcoin has grown from $2.2 billion to over $71 billion so far this year. That is over 3000% growth in just five months</STRONG>. The growth is prompting many commentators to opine the industry is in a bubble. Indeed, many signs of a bubble are there… new projects are able to raise millions of dollars through “Initial Coin Offerings” (ICOs) before even launching a product. Money is now flowing into the market in seemingly indiscriminate ways… one day last month 99 of the top 100 assets were trading higher than the day before, and by large margins.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><H2>2 Reasons Why Cryptocurrencies Are NOT Good Investments:</H2><H3><STRONG>1. Cryptocurrencies don’t MAKE money.</STRONG></H3><P>Warren Buffett doesn’t like gold. Why? Because gold doesn’t MAKE money. It’s the same with currencies: they ARE money, they don’t MAKE money. Further, currencies are a hedging instrument used by corporations, traders, and big-money people…. that’s not us. Investing in currencies directly is expensive and unnecessary for the average investor, and returns on investment don’t warrant the risk.</P><P>Gold is a store of value that grows with inflation. If you consider Bitcoin or the other cryptocurrencies as stores of value (by the way, Ethereum was never designed as such), then they’re STILL not good investments. It’s that simple. Keep in mind, though, that investing is different than trading. Can you make money trading crypto? For sure.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“Volatility yields opportunity for big wins (or losses), but that doesn’t make Ethereum a long-term buy and hold.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><STRONG>2. Volatility of cryptocurrencies makes them NOT currencies.</STRONG></H3><P>And if they’re not currencies, what are they? They are a completely new asset class, which many are putting money into without understanding. It’s the hype that has me scared. I’m not the first one to say it, actually: “It’s not the value I question, but the valuation.” Valuation cannot be infinite, and cryptocurrencies are impossible to properly value.</P><P>For many countries, their currencies are greatly impacted by fluctuations and volatility in the prices of the commodities they produce. What’s the best way to invest in commodities? The producers.</P><H2>Alternatives To Investing Directly In Crypto:</H2><H3><STRONG>So who are the producers of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies?</STRONG></H3><P>In the world of digital, it’s companies like Nvidia ($NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD) that determine how much crypto is produced and how quickly. They control the output, so they control the profit.</P><P>In the case of commodities producers, we’d look for companies with the lowest cost of production.</P><H3><STRONG>Which company produces cryptocurrency most cost effectively? Is it Nvidia or AMD?</STRONG></H3><P>Mining Ethereum is profitable using lower-end Nvidia and AMD GPUs, with the return on investment of a mining rig at around 3 months.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“Choosing between Nvidia and AMD GPUs is a choice based on price. Not just the price of Ethereum, but the price of acquiring the GPU as well. If the price of mid-end GPUs such as the Nvidia GTX 1070 declines, miners can ‘overclock’ the GPU to create more hashes. This is why there is a constant back and forth between AMD vs. NVDA GPUs being the ‘best’ for small-scale mining rigs (4-6 GPUs).”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Trends position AMD as the preferred choice for cryptocurrency mining, but with NVIDIA and AMD releasing GPUs specifically designed for crypto mining, who knows what the future holds?</P><H3><STRONG>How Long Will It Last?</STRONG></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“As for AMD shareholders, be warned that any GPU demand coming from this event will be temporary. Indeed, if anything, the GPU side of things is the one segment that’s clearly going wrong at AMD. At this point, AMD seems to be running one generation (one-plus years) behind Nvidia. AMD is still struggling to put out its Vega competitor to Nvidia’s Pascal, just as Nvidia already is moving on to its next-generation Volta.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P class=""p p2""><EM><STRONG>Whether the market is in a bubble is still up for debate given the enormous potential of digital currencies, and their currently insignificant size in comparison to government issued currencies. There are many reasons to believe growth could continue at a rapid rate.</STRONG></EM></P><H3><STRONG>Thanks for reading!
