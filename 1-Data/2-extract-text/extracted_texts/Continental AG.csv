In this study we identify Australian Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) vulnerable to the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> on the basis of exposure, sensitivity and pressure to disperse in the future. We used an ensemble of species distribution models to predict the distribution of 270 (85%) species of Australian Odonata, continent-wide at the subcatchment scale, and for both current and future <mark>climate</mark>s using two emissions scenarios each for 2055 and 2085. Exposure was scored according to the departure of temperature, precipitation and hydrology from current conditions. Sensitivity accounted for change in the area and suitability of projected climatic habitat, and pressure to disperse combined measurements of average habitat shifts and the loss experienced with lower dispersal rates. Streams and rivers important to future conservation efforts were identified based on the sensitivity-weighted sum of habitat suitability for the most vulnerable species. The overall extent of suitable habitat declined for 56–69% of the species modelled by 2085 depending on emissions scenario. The proportion of species at risk across all components (exposure, sensitivity, pressure to disperse) varied between 7 and 17% from 2055 to 2085 and a further 3–17% of species were also projected to be at high risk due to declines that did not require range shifts. If dispersal to Tasmania was limited, many south-eastern species are at significantly increased risk. Conservation efforts will need to focus on creating and preserving freshwater refugia as part of a broader conservation strategy that improves connectivity and promotes adaptive range shifts. The significant predicted shifts in suitable habitat could potentially exceed the dispersal capacity of Odonata and highlights the challenge faced by other freshwater species.</P></DIV><DIV class=""articleinfo""><P><STRONG>Citation: </STRONG>Bush AA, Nipperess DA, Duursma DE, Theischinger G, Turak E, Hughes L (2014) Continental-Scale Assessment of Risk to the Australian Odonata from <mark>Climate Change</mark>.

River and stream ecosystems appear to be particularly sensitive <A href=""#pone.0088958-Durance1"" class=""ref-tip"">[2]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0088958-Ricciardi1"" class=""ref-tip"">[3]</A> and face numerous challenges including the direct impacts of warming temperatures <A href=""#pone.0088958-Flenner1"" class=""ref-tip"">[4]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0088958-Floury1"" class=""ref-tip"">[5]</A>, altered hydrology <A href=""#pone.0088958-Dll1"" class=""ref-tip"">[6]</A>, the increased frequency of floods and drought <A href=""#pone.0088958-Lough1"" class=""ref-tip"">[7]</A>, sea-level rise <A href=""#pone.0088958-Winn1"" class=""ref-tip"">[8]</A> and multiple other anthropogenic stressors <A href=""#pone.0088958-Nelson1"" class=""ref-tip"">[9]</A>–<A href=""#pone.0088958-Maloney1"" class=""ref-tip"">[11]</A>. <mark>Climate change</mark> is projected to have impacts across all scales of organisation in freshwater ecosystems, from effects on genetic diversity <A href=""#pone.0088958-Taubmann1"" class=""ref-tip"">[12]</A> to community composition <A href=""#pone.0088958-Woodward1"" class=""ref-tip"">[13]</A>. Observations of <mark>climate change</mark> impacts are increasing rapidly, including shifts in phenology <A href=""#pone.0088958-Hassall1"" class=""ref-tip"">[14]</A>, shifts in distribution <A href=""#pone.0088958-Hickling1"" class=""ref-tip"">[15]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0088958-Domisch1"" class=""ref-tip"">[16]</A> and shifts in community composition and structure e.g. <A href=""#pone.0088958-Chessman1"" class=""ref-tip"">[17]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0088958-Comte1"" class=""ref-tip"">[18]</A>.</P><P>Understanding how best to conserve biodiversity under <mark>climate change</mark> is a major challenge, in part due to a poor understanding of species distribution i.e. the Wallacean shortfall <A href=""#pone.0088958-Cardoso1"" class=""ref-tip"">[19]</A>. Freshwater diversity in particular has often been overlooked within the wider terrestrial landscape <A href=""#pone.0088958-Abell1"" class=""ref-tip"">[20]</A> and conservation focus is biased to vertebrates, despite invertebrates contributing the bulk of biodiversity <A href=""#pone.0088958-Cardoso1"" class=""ref-tip"">[19]</A>. To overcome the shortfall in data, Species Distribution Models (SDMs) have become popular tools because they can maximise the use of the limited records we have to predict the suitability of habitat in the wider landscape e.g. <A href=""#pone.0088958-Elith1"" class=""ref-tip"">[21]</A>. By extending projections through time they can be used to predict the threat posed by <mark>climate change</mark> <A href=""#pone.0088958-Heikkinen1"" class=""ref-tip"">[22]</A>–<A href=""#pone.0088958-Sinclair1"" class=""ref-tip"">[24]</A>. If the area of suitable habitat is predicted to be dramatically reduced by <mark>climate change</mark> then that species may face significant risk of extinction in the future as conditions become increasingly marginal. The resolution and complexity of geographic data for river systems is continuously improving and as a result the number of studies applying SDMs to freshwater taxa has increased rapidly in recent years, with applications to fish <A href=""#pone.0088958-Bond1"" class=""ref-tip"">[25]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0088958-Buisson1"" class=""ref-tip"">[26]</A>, platypus <A href=""#pone.0088958-Klamt1"" class=""ref-tip"">[27]</A>, and aquatic invertebrates <A href=""#pone.0088958-Cordellier1"" class=""ref-tip"">[28]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0088958-Balint1"" class=""ref-tip"">[29]</A>.</P><P>In this study we described the distribution of Australian Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies. Air temperature has increased 0.9°C in Australia since 1910, with most warming occurring since 1970, and includes more temperature extremes that match model expectations <A href=""#pone.0088958-Alexander1"" class=""ref-tip"">[30]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0088958-Perkins1"" class=""ref-tip"">[31]</A>. Predicted changes to rainfall and hydrology will mean some regions experience significant deficits and others increased variability in coming decades <A href=""#pone.0088958-Hobday1"" class=""ref-tip"">[32]</A>. Previous studies have shown that Odonata appear to be suited to assessing the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> because their development is strongly temperature dependent <A href=""#pone.0088958-Flenner1"" class=""ref-tip"">[4]</A>, their distribution is not dependent on other species <A href=""#pone.0088958-Arajo2"" class=""ref-tip"">[33]</A>, and they are sensitive to climatic factors e.g. <A href=""#pone.0088958-Rosset1"" class=""ref-tip"">[34]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0088958-Bush1"" class=""ref-tip"">[35]</A>, a key assumption when using SDMs for <mark>climate change</mark> assessments. Odonata have been successfully modelled for conservation purposes <A href=""#pone.0088958-Simaika1"" class=""ref-tip"">[36]</A>, and within studies of <mark>climate change</mark> effects on macroinvertebrates <A href=""#pone.0088958-Domisch1"" class=""ref-tip"">[16]</A>. There have also been many reported changes in odonate ranges consistent with a response to recent <mark>climate change</mark> e.g. <A href=""#pone.0088958-Ott1"" class=""ref-tip"">[37]</A>. In addition, Odonata were selected because, among the major orders of aquatic invertebrates, they occur in all Australian surface waters, their taxonomy is relatively well known, and comprehensive occurrence data are available <A href=""#pone.0088958-Theischinger1"" class=""ref-tip"">[38]</A>.</P><P>We assessed threats to species based on a combination of their likely exposure to climatic change, their sensitivity to climatic factors, and the relative importance of dispersal capability <A href=""#pone.0088958-Williams1"" class=""ref-tip"">[39]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0088958-Foden1"" class=""ref-tip"">[40]</A>. This study assesses the threat to Odonata, an invertebrate group widespread across the Australian continent and models changes in suitability at a spatial scale appropriate for conservation management of freshwater systems. In the absence of measured trait-data to characterise species’ adaptive capacity, typical for invertebrate taxa (but see <A href=""#pone.0088958-Arribas1"" class=""ref-tip"">[41]</A>), we used the distance habitats are predicted to shift in the future to describe the pressure on species to disperse and track suitable conditions. This approach does not therefore describe species’ adaptive capacity <EM>per se</EM>, but identifies the species that would face significantly greater risk if they were <EM>not able</EM> to disperse as fast as their suitable habitats shift. Of the species included in the models, we identified those Australian Odonata most vulnerable to <mark>climate change</mark> across multiple criteria, and identified the specific locations most important for conservation of the most vulnerable species.</P></DIV><DIV id=""section2"" class=""section toc-section""><H2>Materials and Methods</H2><DIV id=""section1"" class=""section toc-section""><H3>Species Data</H3><P>Records of odonate distributions were collated from a diverse range of sources including all state and museum collections, government survey records, local catchment authorities, scientific literature and private collectors. For several collections these records were entered into digital format for the first time, significantly increasing the overall number of records available (<A href=""#pone.0088958.s001"">Table S1</A>). Locality records and taxonomic identification were verified for accuracy as much as possible using habitat descriptions within metadata and expert advice of collectors and museums <A href=""#pone.0088958-Langhammer1"" class=""ref-tip"">[42]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0088958-Kennard1"" class=""ref-tip"">[43]</A>. Although outlying records can influence model fitting, where doubt existed over observation validity the records were removed. Decisions on record validity incorporated factors such as date recorded, life stage (favouring larvae over adults) and gender (females over males). For example, some species had adult males recorded far beyond their usual range (300 km+) in highly arid environments, presumably following an unusually heavy period of rainfall. Populations in these areas are unlikely to be self-sustaining for even a few generations and the records were removed from the dataset.</P><P>The completed dataset included over 32,000 occurrence records from approximately 12,100 localities. Of the 324 Australian Odonata, modelling included 197 species recorded from 30 or more subcatchments, and a further 76 species that were treated as “Uncommon” (15–30 subcatchments) <A href=""#pone.0088958-Wisz1"" class=""ref-tip"">[44]</A>. The majority of records were collected within the last 20 years (95%), but records as far back as 1950 were also used in the case of some uncommon species where native vegetation was still intact, and they had not been recorded in more than 14 subcatchments more recently. A number of species distribution modelling studies have used low numbers of records to successfully predict distributions e.g. <A href=""#pone.0088958-James1"" class=""ref-tip"">[45]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0088958-Reside1"" class=""ref-tip"">[46]</A>, and by adjusting parameters so models were not over-fitted we were able to include uncommon species e.g. <A href=""#pone.0088958-Domisch1"" class=""ref-tip"">[16]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0088958-Pearson1"" class=""ref-tip"">[47]</A>. Nonetheless, approximately 51 species were recorded from fewer than 15 subcatchments and were not included in this study.</P></DIV><DIV id=""section2"" class=""section toc-section""><H3>Environmental Data</H3><P><mark>Climate change</mark> projections were based on Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), being the standardised warming trajectories due to be used in the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>’s Fifth Assessment Report in 2013 <A href=""#pone.0088958-Moss1"" class=""ref-tip"">[48]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0088958-vanVuuren1"" class=""ref-tip"">[49]</A>. The RCPs used in this study describe a range of stabilisation, mitigation and non-mitigation pathways that under medium or high emissions scenarios result in radiative forcing reaching 6 and 8.5 W/m<SUP>2</SUP> respectively by 2100, equivalent to global average temperatures increasing 3.0 and 4.9°C <A href=""#pone.0088958-Rogelj1"" class=""ref-tip"">[50]</A>. Coarse resolution <mark>climate</mark> data were provided by the Tyndall Centre, University of East Anglia, UK (available at <A href=""http://climascope.wwfus.org"">http://climascope.wwfus.org</A>). Based on the study by Fordham et al. <A href=""#pone.0088958-Fordham1"" class=""ref-tip"">[51]</A> we selected an ensemble of the seven global <mark>climate</mark> models (GCMs) most successful at reproducing the recent global and regional precipitation patterns of Australia (specifically CCSR-MIROC32MED, CSIRO-MK30, GFDL-CM20, MPI-ECHAM5, MRI-CGCM232A, UKMO-HADCM3 and UKMO-HADGEM1). The data were 10-year averages centered around 2055, and 2085, for RCP6 (medium emissions scenario) and RCP8.5 (high emissions scenario). Lower emissions scenarios were omitted in this study as all indications suggest achieving the necessary reductions are unlikely <A href=""#pone.0088958-Peters1"" class=""ref-tip"">[52]</A>. Research has shown that <mark>climate</mark> ensembles perform better than any single GCM in simulating observed conditions <A href=""#pone.0088958-Fordham2"" class=""ref-tip"">[53]</A>, and multiple scenarios are useful to span the range of uncertainty in predicting future <mark>climate</mark>s <A href=""#pone.0088958-Beaumont1"" class=""ref-tip"">[54]</A>. Monthly RCP data were statistically downscaled to a 1 km<SUP>2</SUP> resolution, independent of elevation, using a cubic spline of the anomalies (deviance from modelled current and modelled future) and these anomalies were applied to a current <mark>climate</mark> baseline of 1950 to 2000. The current <mark>climate</mark> data were sourced from Worldclim (<A href=""http://www.worldclim.org"">www.worldclim.org</A>) and the data were created as defined in Hijmans et al. <A href=""#pone.0088958-Hijmans1"" class=""ref-tip"">[55]</A>. The same method was used to create bioclimatic variables from the downscaled future <mark>climate</mark> data. All downscaling and bioclimatic variable generation was performed using the ‘<mark>climate</mark>s’ package <A href=""#pone.0088958-VanDerWal1"" class=""ref-tip"">[56]</A> in R v.2.15 <A href=""#pone.0088958-R1"" class=""ref-tip"">[57]</A>.</P><P>Rather than using gridded data, models were based on the stream network from the National Catchment and Stream Environment Database V.1.1.3, part of the Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric <A href=""#pone.0088958-GEOFABRIC1"" class=""ref-tip"">[58]</A>. When predicting habitat suitability in river networks, organising the modelling environment and predictor variables to reflect the structure of a freshwater system is important because it can influence the accuracy of freshwater SDMs without necessarily affecting performance metrics <A href=""#pone.0088958-Domisch2"" class=""ref-tip"">[59]</A>. Catchment boundaries were coded hierarchically using the Pfafstetter classification system that defines 1.4 million stream subcatchments at the continental scale. <mark>Climate</mark> data were aggregated to the same stream subcatchments. Mean annual runoff was generated by James et al. <A href=""#pone.0088958-James1"" class=""ref-tip"">[45]</A> for the same stream network and same future <mark>climate</mark> scenarios using a bucket model outlined by Donohue et al. <A href=""#pone.0088958-Donohue1"" class=""ref-tip"">[60]</A>. Local differences in precipitation can be poor proxies for changes to runoff <A href=""#pone.0088958-Chiew1"" class=""ref-tip"">[61]</A>, and hydrological forecasts can therefore greatly improve projections of habitat suitability for freshwater species.</P><P>We used ENMTools <A href=""#pone.0088958-Warren1"" class=""ref-tip"">[62]</A> and Maxent <A href=""#pone.0088958-Elith2"" class=""ref-tip"">[63]</A> to calculate model AIC (Akaike Information Criterion <A href=""#pone.0088958-Akaike1"" class=""ref-tip"">[64]</A>) and to rank variables for approximately 20% of the species. We did not observe a significant difference in variable selection among major taxonomic families or between species that could be associated with still or flowing waters, but variable selection did differ among species assigned to different geographic regions (see <A href=""#pone.0088958.s003"">File S1</A>). By selecting models with the lowest AIC the array of climatic, hydrological and topographic variables was reduced to eight. The predictor variables used included three temperature variables (annual mean, seasonality, and minimum of the coldest month), three precipitation variables (precipitation of the wettest and driest quarters, and seasonality), one hydrological (mean accumulated flow) and one topographical (valley confinement). Valley confinement is a useful proxy for the sedimentation characteristics of a subcatchment and particularly useful for upland catchments <A href=""#pone.0088958-Gallant1"" class=""ref-tip"">[65]</A>. Most species were best modelled using seven variables, although uncommon species in each region were modelled using five. Selection only varied geographically among groups based on the use of precipitation in either dry or wet quarters. Australia has very few Odonata exclusively associated with standing water and this may be why presence of standing water bodies such as lakes did not rank highly <A href=""#pone.0088958-Theischinger1"" class=""ref-tip"">[38]</A>. In the case of two dune lake specialists, the density of lakes and extent of sandy soils were included in models, although this did not significantly improve model scores.</P></DIV><DIV id=""section3"" class=""section toc-section""><H3>Habitat Suitability Modelling</H3><P>Odonata distributions were modelled using an ensemble of five commonly used algorithms within the package <EM>BIOMOD</EM> 2 in R <A href=""#pone.0088958-Thuiller1"" class=""ref-tip"">[66]</A>. Algorithms included generalised linear models (GLM), generalised boosted models (GBM), generalised additive models (GAM), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and Maxent <A href=""#pone.0088958-Elith3"" class=""ref-tip"">[67]</A>. All models were run with 10 replicates, using a standard 70/30 split for training and testing data. Algorithms were run using their default settings and adjusted as follows: GLM, polynomial terms were ranked by AIC; GBM, fourfold cross-validation and a maximum of 2,000 trees; GAM, a spline function with a degree of smoothing of four and 10,000 pseudo-absences.</P><P>Model evaluation was conducted using the standard measure of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the True Skills Statistic (TSS). The sole use of AUC in SDM studies has received some criticism, particularly when models are fitted across large areas <A href=""#pone.0088958-Lobo1"" class=""ref-tip"">[68]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0088958-Smith1"" class=""ref-tip"">[69]</A>, and so TSS was used in weighting model importance for ensemble projection <A href=""#pone.0088958-Thuiller1"" class=""ref-tip"">[66]</A>, and maximised when selecting a suitable threshold to perform binary transformations <A href=""#pone.0088958-Liu1"" class=""ref-tip"">[70]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0088958-Cao1"" class=""ref-tip"">[71]</A>. AUC scores range from 0 to 1; values of 0.5 indicate a performance no better than random, whereas 1 reflects perfect model accuracy. TSS scores range from −1 to 1, with 0 indicating no skill and 1 a perfect ability to distinguish positive and false scores.</P><P>The majority of Odonata records in Australia were distributed through the more mesic coastal regions, and there was a bias in their proximity to urban settlements, some major rivers and highways. As the ranges of most species are regionally restricted, the use of pseudo-absences from the entire study area would have led to exaggerated discrimination statistics <A href=""#pone.0088958-Lobo1"" class=""ref-tip"">[68]</A>, <A href=""#pone.0088958-Smith1"" class=""ref-tip"">[69]</A>, and less informative models <A href=""#pone.0088958-Acevedo1"" class=""ref-tip"">[72]</A>. Pseudo-absences were selected from background points where other species had been collected within a 300 km radius of a species’ presence record <A href=""#pone.0088958-BarbetMassin1"" class=""ref-tip"">[73]</A>, the maximum range we considered available to dispersing Odonata under current conditions. Pseudo-absences were supplemented where necessary by random selection to standardise the total across species. By reducing the overall extent of pseudo-absences, the model projections are more likely to extrapolate beyond the known species-environment relationships, potentially overestimating suitability in distant locations <A href=""#pone.0088958-VanDerWal2"" class=""ref-tip"">[74]</A>. To counter extrapolation we constrained projections using environmental clamping that reduced the suitability of a subcatchment when more than one environmental factor was outside the limits used in model construction <A href=""#pone.0088958-Elith2"" class=""ref-tip"">[63]</A>. The clamping allowed some reasonable extrapolation of distributions to fill gaps in current habitat, but constrained suitability under future projections to reflect similar environmental conditions to the present.</P><P>Model performance based on TSS (0.827+/−0.124) and AUC was typically high (0.946+/−0.06), although TSS scores were more variable (see <A href=""#pone.0088958.s003"">File S1</A> and <A href=""#pone.0088958.s002"">Table S2</A>). TSS scores were lowest among several common continental species, but they were retained after closer examination showed that their poor scores were the result of misclassification only in the arid zone where the patchy nature of waterholes made assessment difficult. However, three species with highly restricted current distributions were subsequently removed from the analysis because of high variation in projections from different models, particularly for future <mark>climate change</mark> scenarios. For the 270 remaining species modelled, the treatment of species as uncommon did not significantly influence the predicted overall change in habitat extent (t<SUB>(89)</SUB> = −0.09, p = 0.926), but there was an increase in model performance commonly observed for narrow range species <A href=""#pone.0088958-Lobo1"" class=""ref-tip"">[68]</A>.

Species at risk across all components were classified as highly vulnerable (Category 1). Species that are not required to disperse long distances but are still exposed and sensitive to change are considered vulnerable (Category 2). If a species is exposed to <mark>climate change</mark> and alternative suitable habitats are available but require significant dispersal, it was classified as having the potential to persist (Category 3). It is also possible, though unlikely in a modelled environment, for a species to experience a significant decline and distributional shift before becoming significantly exposed to environmental change (Category 4).

And over the past year, many countries, particularly in the developing world, decided that an especially effective way to reach those targets is through their farms.</P><P><A href=""http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5666e.pdf"">Nearly 80 percent</A> of the countries said they would use agricultural practices to curb <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/topic/<mark>climate</mark>-change"" target=""_blank""><mark>climate change</mark></A>, and more than 90 percent said they would use those practices in addition to changes in forestry and land use linked to farming.</P><P>&quot;2016 has been a very good year for agriculture and <mark>climate</mark>,&quot; said Martin Frick, director of <mark>climate</mark>, energy and tenure at the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. &quot;It's become possible to finally discuss the elephant in the room.&quot;</P><P>When <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/21112016/paris-<mark>climate</mark>-change-agreement-cop-22-marrakech-donald-trump"" target=""_blank""><mark>climate</mark> negotiators gathered in Marrakech in November</A> to begin mapping out the process for reaching the Paris goals, groups hosted at least 80 agriculture-focused sessions.</P><P>&quot;Agriculture has really lagged,&quot; said Craig Hanson, director of the food, forests and water program at the World Resources Institute. &quot;Considering it contributes 13 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and 24 percent of net emissions with land-use change, it's surprising it's taken so long...But it's finally happening,&quot; he said.</P><P><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-d3dc987e-65ec-6d48-ff32-58555da8fdc7"">In the U.S., the world's second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, agriculture's role in <mark>climate change</mark></SPAN> has been discussed mostly by advocacy groups. And while the Department of Agriculture has launched programs to increase farmland's capacity to capture <mark>carbon</mark>, those are voluntary. The U.S.'s plans for meeting the Paris goals rely mainly on energy and transportation.</P><P>When the U.N.'s Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark> launched its first global <mark>climate</mark> summit in 1992, agriculture hardly even entered the conversation. It wasn't until about a decade ago that research began to show its contribution to global warming, with special attention paid to the ravages of deforestation for agriculture, especially palm oil.</P><P>&quot;The numbers are pretty staggering. Maybe even a third of greenhouse gas emissions come from the land—more than transportation—but that wasn't clear until 10 years ago,&quot; said Seth Shames, who leads policy research for EcoAgriculture Partners, a group focused on hunger, rural poverty and biodiversity. &quot;Those issues started getting discussed in the <mark>climate change</mark> community. The forest people were able to get organized...and there was less political resistance in the <mark>climate</mark> world.&quot;</P><P>In response, the UNFCCC <A href=""http://redd.unfccc.int/"">launched a program</A> that pays developing countries to preserve their <mark>carbon</mark>-absorbing forests, including standards for measuring, reporting and verifying the emissions cuts.</P><P>Similar standards haven't been developed yet for agriculture.</P><P>&quot;Right now, we don't have mechanisms in place to really capitalize on the benefits that agriculture mitigation strategies can provide,&quot; said Ernie Shea, president of Solutions From The Land, a collaboration of agricultural industry and conservation groups. &quot;Forestry's much further ahead on measuring impacts. We're not there yet with agriculture.&quot;</P><P>The conversation around agriculture's role in <mark>climate change</mark> stems from a sea change in negotiations themselves. In 2009, the <mark>climate</mark> summit in Copenhagen fell apart, largely, some believe, because countries bristled at the top-down approach that dictated what countries must do.</P><P>After Copenhagen, negotiators began working instead on a pledge-based approach.</P><P>&quot;The Paris agreement doesn't impose anything on member states, and turns it around and says: What can you bring to the table?&quot; Frick explained. &quot;This fundamental change in logic has had a tremendous impact for agriculture. Agriculture, for every single country, is one of the most sensitive areas—it's an emotional topic.&quot;</P><P>Ultimately, agriculture emerged as ripe for action. It is existentially linked to a country's very survival and increasingly under threat from weather extremes, drought and floods. Agriculture, in other words, has to adapt to <mark>climate change</mark>, but also has a huge, unrealized potential to mitigate <mark>climate change</mark>. That can happen through farm practices like soil <mark>carbon</mark> sequestration through cover cropping, or by making existing farmland more productive and efficient.</P><P>&quot;Drought impacts, flooding, higher nighttime temperatures affecting pollination, new weeds, invasive species. There's an awareness in the agriculture community that we're at risk and we're not as resilient as we need to be,&quot; Shea said.</P><P>That risk is driving the discussion. Farm industry leaders and academics formed the North American <mark>Climate</mark> Smart Agriculture Alliance in 2015 to prompt changes in agricultural practices that have <mark>climate</mark> benefits. Shea says the alliance's approach, much like the approach at the international level, is to promote the idea that certain production techniques are not only better for the environment, but also for farm productivity. The alliance's members include the American Farm Bureau Federation, which continues to deny the scientific consensus on <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>&quot;People are turned off by the <mark>climate change</mark> conversation,&quot; Shea said. &quot;Once you get into a conversation about improving productivity, you can get into a conversation about co-benefits.&quot;</P><P>Greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector in developed countries average about 12 percent, compared to 35 percent in developing countries, which makes agriculture a relatively less important solution in industrialized countries. Still, advocates are pushing agricultural interests and regulators in the U.S. to do their part, pointing <A href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.13340/abstract"">to research</A> that says reaching the goals of the Paris agreement will be impossible without agriculture's contribution.</P><P>Educating farmers about the benefits—and using them to meet Paris targets—could provide the best way forward.</P><P>&quot;There's a lot of fatigue with the negativity on <mark>climate change</mark>,&quot; said Thomas Driscoll, policy director at the National Farmers Union, the U.S.'s second largest farm group. &quot;Agriculture and <mark>climate change</mark> is exciting because there's a lot that can be done. Doing the right thing for the <mark>climate</mark> can save farmers money.&quot;</P><P>But challenges lie ahead. In both developing and advanced countries, many farmers can't afford to take <mark>climate</mark>-targeted steps—such as letting land lie fallow to regenerate—unless governments provide meaningful financial incentives.</P><P>In the plans that many countries submitted to reach their <mark>climate</mark> pledges, actual details around agriculture are scarce. And only one country—Rwanda—included plans to address food waste, which <A href=""http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/"">contributes 8 percent</A> of global greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P>Homing in on those details and the precise strategies for cutting emissions is the work of the coming global talks.</P><P>&quot;The next five years is going to be period where we, as a community—researchers, agronomists, NGOs—are going to start thinking about what we can do, the bundle of things we can do in agriculture,&quot; Hanson said. &quot;We're on the agenda.

Agriculture is an emissions-intensive sector; it accounted for less than 1 percent of U.S. production (in real gross value-added terms), but emitted 10 percent of U.S. GHGs in 2014. Energy-related CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission sources—which dominate GHG emissions in most other production sectors—are dwarfed in agriculture by unique crop and livestock emissions of nitrous oxide and methane. Crop and pasture soil management generates the most GHG emissions, due largely to the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers and other nutrients. Enteric fermentation (digestion in ruminant livestock) and manure management ranks second. Agriculture and forestry are unique in providing opportunities for withdrawing <mark>carbon</mark> from the atmosphere through biological sequestration in soil and biomass <mark>carbon</mark> sinks. The <mark>carbon</mark> sinks, which are largely due to land use change from agricultural to forest land (afforestation) and forest management on continuing forest, offset 11.5 percent of total U.S. GHG emissions in 2014 (see <A data-id=""15176"" href=""/topics/natural-resources-environment/<mark>climate</mark>-change/agricultural-production-and-mitigation/"" title=""Agricultural Production and Mitigation"">Agricultural Production and Mitigation</A>).</P><H3>The National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment</H3><P>The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) aims &quot;to assist the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change.&quot; In this role, every four years it produces a National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment (NCA) that surveys and synthesizes the most recent science about <mark>climate change</mark> impacts and adaptation in the United States.

They predict that these, and other, observed <mark>climate change</mark>s will become more severe in coming years.</P><P>These changes in the <mark>climate</mark> are imposing an increasing burden on governments, especially in countries with limited resources, in their efforts to protect vulnerable populations and realize human rights. Changing precipitation patterns such as drought, and shorter but more intense rainfall, can have negative direct and indirect impacts on health and contribute to desertification and flooding, food insecurity, migration and increased conflict.

Turkana County borders South Sudan, Ethiopia and Uganda and is globally renowned as the cradle of mankind: in Turkana County and the Omo Valley in southern Ethiopia, archeologists have found the oldest ancestors to modern humans, dating back more than one million years ago. However, today, Turkana County is home to a rapidly growing population that is among the poorest in Kenya.</P><DIV class=""embed-media""><A href=""/view-mode/modal/282041"" title=""Launch Gallery"" class=""link--modal link--inline-block""><SPAN class=""icon-label"">Launch Gallery</SPAN></A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE><P>According to government records, the Turkana population has grown dramatically in the last two decades, increasing in the past few years from an estimated 855,393 people in 2009 to 1,256,152 people in 2015. The population is predominately indigenous Turkana people, and pastoral, relying on livestock herding. Some Turkana fish in the waters of Lake Turkana, while others reside in the county’s towns. Their traditional reliance on natural resources for food and livelihood, the historic marginalization of the region, and the lack of infrastructure make them especially vulnerable to any changes in the environment. Turkana County has had a long history of chronic malnutrition and some of the poorest health indicators in Kenya.</P><P>Over the past several decades, Kenyan government data show a clear trend in increasing average temperatures in the country as a whole and in Turkana County. While global mean temperatures are estimated to have increased by 0.8°C (1.5°F) in the past century, in Turkana County minimum and maximum air temperatures have increased by between 2 and 3°C (3.5 and 5.5°F) between 1967 and 2012. Rainfall patterns have also changed: the long rainy season has become shorter and dryer and the short rainy season has become longer and wetter, while overall annual rainfall remains at low levels.</P><P>Human Rights Watch conducted research in Turkana County between April 2014 and February 2015, interviewing 40 people, including pastoralists, fishers, health clinic staff, students, teachers, local civil society activists, and police officers. In addition, Human Rights Watch reviewed international, Kenyan and Turkana County laws, policies and development plans, including the Turkana County Development Plan and the Kenya National <mark>Climate Change</mark> Action Plan and met with Turkana County and Kenyan national government officials.</P><P>The report finds that <mark>climate change</mark>, in combination with existing political, environmental and economic development challenges in Turkana, has had an impact on the Turkana people’s ability to access food, water, health and security. Turkana County has long experienced periods of cyclical drought. However, increasing temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns, combined with population growth and threats to Lake Turkana from hydroelectric and irrigation projects in Ethiopia, present significant, long-term challenges for the Turkana County and Kenyan national governments.  </P><P>Increased temperatures and unpredictable rainy seasons have placed increased pressure on water resources, resulting in less dry season grazing land, diminished livestock herds, and increased competition over grazing lands. <SPAN lang=""EN"">Pastoralists told Human Rights Watch that prolonged and more frequent droughts have exacerbated already difficult access to potable water, making every day a struggle for survival. Women and girls often walk extremely long distances to dig for water in dry riverbeds. Many children become sick because their families are unable to provide them with sufficient food and clean water. </SPAN>In northern Turkana County, increased competition over grazing lands and water has heightened the likelihood of conflict and insecurity.</P><P>Industrial and agricultural development across Turkana’s northern border with Ethiopia also poses threats that could affect the realization of rights of the Turkana people. Over the past several years, Ethiopia has embarked on a massive plan for dams, water-intensive irrigated cotton and sugar plantations, and irrigation canals and other infrastructure in Ethiopia’s Omo River Basin, which provides 90 percent of the water in Lake Turkana. These developments are predicted to dramatically reduce the water supply of Lake Turkana: the planned irrigation projects alone could reduce by up to 50 percent the Omo River’s total flow. Some scientists predict that Lake Turkana, the largest desert lake in the world, could recede into two small pools.</P><P>Reduced water levels in Lake Turkana will have a devastating impact on the environment and people of Turkana County. Dramatic reductions in freshwater input from the Omo River into Lake Turkana will increase levels of salinity in the lake and raise water temperatures, decimating fish breeding areas and mature fish populations. Higher air temperatures will increase rates of evaporation, further increasing salinity while reducing biological productivity.</P><P>Kenya’s national and county governments have acknowledged the impact that <mark>climate change</mark> has had and will have on people’s lives. At the <mark>Climate</mark> Summit in New York in September 2014, Kenya’s President Uhuru Kenyatta urged countries to take decisive action on <mark>climate change</mark>, branding it a “serious global challenge that continues to affect Africa’s socio-economic development.” Kenya has also made several efforts towards developing a national policy addressing the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, including the Kenya National <mark>Climate Change</mark> Response Strategy (2010) and the Kenya National <mark>Climate Change</mark> Action Plan (2013). Earlier this year, a <mark>climate change</mark> bill, introducing a <mark>Climate Change</mark> Council to ensure better coordination of the different <mark>climate change</mark> programs within the government, was passed in the National Assembly and is, at the time of writing, awaiting the adoption by the Senate and signature of the President. </P><P>However, Human Rights Watch research finds that much more needs to be done. The Turkana County and the Kenyan national government have been struggling to address the human rights consequences of <mark>climate change</mark> and other environmental developments for the most marginalized populations. At the national level, the adoption of the <mark>climate change</mark> bill, and the development and implementation of several <mark>climate change</mark>-related policies, have been delayed several times. Existing health and development policies largely fail to address the disproportionate impact that these changes are likely to have on Kenya’s most marginalized populations, including indigenous peoples, and the national government has not yet published a rights-based National Adaptation Plan (NAP) in accordance with Kenya’s commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol. Kenya’s obligations under international human rights law further mandate that the government use available resources to progressively realize rights to food, security, water, and health in a non-discriminatory manner.</P><P>At the county level, the 2013 devolution agreement which led to the decentralization of many government functions has created many new responsibilities for the county government which gives it an expanded role in addressing the human rights effects of <mark>climate change</mark> and other environmental threats. Yet, the county government has done little to integrate <mark>climate change</mark> into development plans or develop adaptation strategies for vulnerable populations.</P><P>The government of Kenya is not alone in facing <mark>climate change</mark> and other environmental threats. Kenya should recognize that these changes will likely impede its ability to realize the human rights of many people. As a regional leader, Kenya should assess this impact, identify which individuals and communities are most vulnerable, and take steps to reduce this vulnerability and ensure that human rights standards are integrated into adaptation plans. Throughout this process, the government should ensure meaningful participation and access to relevant information for affected groups and refrain from investments and implementing actions that could undermine people’s rights.</P><SECTION data-section=""204ee8""><H1>Key Recommendations</H1><H2>To the Government of Kenya</H2><UL><LI>Ensure that the National Adaptation Plan under development is in accordance with Kenya’s obligations under the UNFCCC and international human rights law that includes plans on how to protect rights to food, security, water, and health.

Its traditional reliance on natural resources for food and livelihood, the historic marginalization of the region and lack of infrastructure, its considerable population growth, and the threat to Lake Turkana of Ethiopian development projects make the region especially vulnerable to drought that may be intensified by <mark>climate change</mark>. Turkana is home to Lake Turkana, the largest desert lake in the world, and is also globally renowned as the cradle of mankind. Pastoralist areas in East African countries tend to have the highest incidence of poverty and the least access to basic services compared with non-pastoralist areas. For hundreds of years, nomadic herders have lived in semi-arid lowlands like Turkana County, adapting to the unpredictable environment by moving livestock according to the shifting availability of water and pasture. Like many other pastoralists in East Africa, the Turkana people have long struggled to access sufficient food and water. Historic marginalization and their livelihood in a fragile ecosystem make them especially vulnerable to the effects of any changes in the environment and <mark>climate</mark>. Their situation illustrates how <mark>climate change</mark> could aggravate existing obstacles to the realization of basic human rights and challenge the ability of governments to protect and fulfill those rights.</P><P>In the course of this research, Human Rights Watch conducted 40 interviews with pastoralists and fishers along the western shore of Lake Turkana. Human Rights Watch also interviewed health clinic staff, school students, teachers, local civil society, county government officials and police officers in Turkana County, many of them in Lodwar, the county’s capital. In addition, Human Rights Watch met with representatives of the Kenyan national government and Kenyan civil society during the <mark>climate change</mark> conferences in Lima, Peru (December 2014), Geneva, Switzerland (February 2015), and Bonn, Germany (June 2015), following up via email on issues raised at the meetings. On March 3, 2015 Human Rights Watch wrote to the national government and requested information on national <mark>climate change</mark> policy. No response was received at time of writing.</P><P>Interviews were conducted in Turkana and English using interpreters when necessary. None of the interviewees were offered any form of compensation and all interviewees were informed of the purpose of the interview and its voluntary nature, including their right to stop the interview at any point. All individuals interviewed gave informed consent to be interviewed. Although most individuals were interviewed individually, some interviews with pastoralists were conducted in group settings, in line with community norms.  A broad range of interviewees was sought, including men and women of different ages and livelihoods. However, 30 of the 40 interviewees were men.</P><P>In addition to interviews, Human Rights Watch consulted various secondary materials, including academic articles and reports from nongovernmental organizations, which provide further insight into human rights issues in Turkana. This material includes previous Human Rights Watch research as well as information collected by other credible experts and independent researchers. In addition to the current work in Turkana County, Human Rights Watch has been monitoring development in the lower Omo valley for the past several years, for example issuing a report in 2011 and satellite analysis in 2014 on the forced displacement of indigenous pastoral communities to make way for state-run sugar plantations.</P><P>An external technical expert reviewed an earlier draft of this report. However, this report is not a comprehensive assessment of the environmental and <mark>climate change</mark> threats to local communities in Turkana County. Such an assessment would require more in-depth qualitative and quantitative investigation, including in southern and western Turkana County, as well as mathematical modeling of multiple <mark>climate change</mark> scenarios.</P></SECTION><SECTION data-section=""4e51ad""><H1>Map of Turkana County</H1></SECTION><SECTION data-section=""4e021c""><H1>I.

County governments were established after the March 2013 general elections. Under the new structure, 47 county governments around Kenya have semi-autonomous status from the central government in order to address the inequitable distribution of resources that stemmed from centralization in the past.<A href=""#_ftn43"" name=""_ftnref43"" title=""""><SUP><SUP><SPAN>[43]</SPAN></SUP></SUP></A> The devolution of basic functions to the county level has coincided with increased interest in the Turkana region from the national government due in part to promising results from oil exploration. Some functions critical for the lives of the Turkana, including provision of health and education services, have been devolved to the county level. Considerable ambiguity exists between national and county levels of government over other functions of importance to the Turkana, including security and natural resource management.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>The region encompassing Turkana County, the Lower Omo River valley, and the eastern shores of Lake Turkana, is globally renowned as the cradle of mankind: Archeologists working in the region have found here the oldest ancestors to modern humans.<A href=""#_ftn44"" name=""_ftnref44"" title=""""><SUP><SUP><SPAN>[44]</SPAN></SUP></SUP></A> However, the region’s more recent history is one of colonial rule and neglect. Despite resistance, the British colonized the area in the 1920s and forced the Turkana to settle in the area now known as Turkana County. After the Second World War, the colonial administration segregated the Turkana people by categorizing Turkana Province, as it was known under colonial rule, as a closed district, and enforced a strict disarmament of the Turkana people. The Turkana strongly resisted the colonial administration and the region suffered continued marginalization and underdevelopment, while experiencing repeated raids from Ethiopia’s Daasanach tribe, an agro-pastoral ethnic group. After independence, there was increased development in Turkana, but antagonistic relations and cattle raiding between the Turkana and their neighbors continued. Insecurity, combined with two severe droughts in the early 1980s, further inhibited development efforts in the region.</P><P>In 2013 the Kenyan national government devolved some government functions to county governments. This change provided opportunities for the Turkana to have more control over local policymaking and the allocation of resources, but the county continues to be underdeveloped and politically marginalized, ranking as one of the poorest counties in Kenya.<A href=""#_ftn45"" name=""_ftnref45"" title=""""><SUP><SUP><SPAN>[45]</SPAN></SUP></SUP></A> There is little health, education, transportation or economic infrastructure.<A href=""#_ftn46"" name=""_ftnref46"" title=""""><SUP><SUP><SPAN>[46]</SPAN></SUP></SUP></A> More than 85 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, and only 15 percent of the population has received a primary school education.<A href=""#_ftn47"" name=""_ftnref47"" title=""""><SUP><SUP><SPAN>[47]</SPAN></SUP></SUP></A> A majority of the Turkana population uses unimproved water sources for drinking, and less than 10 percent of the population has access to improved sanitation services.<A href=""#_ftn48"" name=""_ftnref48"" title=""""><SUP><SUP><SPAN>[48]</SPAN></SUP></SUP></A> Maternal mortality in Turkana is three times the national average.<A href=""#_ftn49"" name=""_ftnref49"" title=""""><SUP><SUP><SPAN>[49]</SPAN></SUP></SUP></A> Insecurity is also a major problem in Turkana and is made worse by the proliferation of small arms from neighboring countries, with persistent cattle raiding to and from neighboring regions.<A href=""#_ftn50"" name=""_ftnref50"" title=""""><SUP><SUP><SPAN>[50]</SPAN></SUP></SUP></A> The causes of these conflicts are long-standing, with competition over scarce grazing land and water resources a key component of the tension.<A href=""#_ftn51"" name=""_ftnref51"" title=""""><SUP><SUP><SPAN>[51]</SPAN></SUP></SUP></A></P><P>Along with Marsabit and Samburu Counties, Turkana County is home to Lake Turkana, the largest desert lake in the world.

In 2014, as a result of a lawsuit filed by the NGO Friends of Lake Turkana, the Kenyan High Court ruled that the government is required to make public all relevant information in relation to the importation, purchase, and transmission of electricity from Ethiopia.

Equality and Non-Discrimination</B></P><P>The principle of non-discrimination and equality is central to the international human rights framework. It requires that no group or individual should be excluded from adaptation planning and that priority in allocating limited public resources should be given to those who do not have access or who face discrimination in the enjoyment of their basic human rights.</P><P><B>2. Progressive realization </B></P><P>States need to take deliberate steps to ensure progressive realization of economic, social and cultural rights. They should devote the necessary planning, and financial and institutional resources to <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation in order to avoid retrogression from existing human rights standards. During periods of growth, states should plan for the long-term realization of the human rights so as to build resilience for times of acute crisis.</P><P><B>3. Active, free and meaningful participation and access to information</B></P><P>Looking at <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation planning from a human rights perspective mandates that individuals and communities should have access to information and participate in decision-making. Poor people and members of marginalized groups are frequently excluded from decision-making regarding adaptation planning. Community participation in the planning and design of adaptation programs is important to ensure that plans are relevant and appropriate, and thus ultimately <mark>sustainable</mark>.</P><P><B>4. Accountability</B></P><P>A central feature of a human rights-based approach to adaptation planning is its focus on accountability, which underlines the obligations of the state, as duty- bearer, to respect and fulfill human rights. In practice, accountability requires the development of laws, policies, institutions, administrative procedures and mechanisms of redress to promote and protect human rights.</P><P><B>Integrating these principles into adaptation planning entails steps to:</B></P><UL><LI>Identify especially vulnerable individuals and marginalized social groups through disaggregated data according to prohibited grounds of discrimination (human rights risk assessment)</LI><LI>Ensure that the process of identifying disadvantaged individuals and groups is inclusive and participatory</LI><LI>Fully include vulnerable groups and individuals in all levels of adaptation planning, as well as implementation processes</LI><LI>Understand and address their unique needs through targeted and differentiated interventions</LI><LI>Ensure that adaptation activities do not inadvertently worsen their vulnerability</LI><LI>Redress power imbalances and other underlying structural causes of differential vulnerability within and between households</LI><LI>Identify and address barriers and reasons for lack of access to participation planning</LI><LI>Set specific targets for disadvantaged groups</LI><LI>Ensure that the adaptation plan foresees monitoring mechanisms measuring the reduction of inequalities</LI><LI>Monitor the increase or decrease in inequalities</LI></UL></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>Overall, the Kenyan government has shown a clear commitment to addressing <mark>climate change</mark> through a high-level, coordinated effort that gives priority to addressing the disproportionate impact of <mark>climate change</mark> on vulnerable populations. Unfortunately, this commitment has yet to truly move from rhetoric to action, with incomplete and pending policies and uncommitted funding that is already desperately needed. In addition, there appear to be no clear criteria for prioritizing funding for <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation or mitigation and concerns have been raised about transparency and accountability for international donor funding provided to the government.</P><P>The devolution of the government introduced by Kenya’s constitution in 2010 also provides a challenge and an opportunity to integrate <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation planning at a local level. However, there are overlapping mandates at both the county and national level governments around issues such as security, emergency management, and natural resource management. While this uncertainty is somewhat inevitable given the complexity of devolution and the inter-departmental response required of <mark>climate change</mark>, this lack of clarity has contributed to a stalled response to <mark>climate change</mark>. With Kenya’s new constitution mandating the implementation of national environmental policy through the county government, there is a need for stronger coordination for policy coherence.</P></SECTION><SECTION data-section=""e7ecbd""><H1>VI. Legal Standards and Government Obligations to Respond to the Effects of <mark>Climate Change</mark></H1><P>Economic, social and cultural rights, such as the right to food, water, health and livelihood, are subject to progressive realization on the basis of available resources. This is in recognition of the fact that states require sufficient resources, and time, to meet their obligations to respect, protect, and fulfil these rights. However, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has stressed that the steps required to meet this goal be “deliberate, concrete and targeted as clearly as possible towards meeting the obligations” in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and that there is an obligation to “move as expeditiously and effectively as possible towards that goal.”<A href=""#_ftn175"" name=""_ftnref175"" title=""""><SUP><SUP><SPAN>[175]</SPAN></SUP></SUP></A> The diversion of public resources through corruption and mismanagement will generally violate a government’s obligation to “progressively realize” economic, social, and cultural rights because it reduces the available resources a government has to invest in essential services.

Any activities undertaken within the State party’s jurisdiction should not deprive another country of the ability to realize the right to water for persons in its jurisdiction.” CESCR, General Comment No. 15, The Right to Water, U.N. Doc. E/C.12/2002/11 (2003), para. 31. As with all socioeconomic rights, the rights to water and sanitation entail state obligations of both an immediate and progressive kind. Economic, social and cultural rights are subject to progressive realization, in recognition of the fact that states require sufficient resources and time to respect, protect, and fulfil these rights. Art. 2 (1) International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) stipulates, however, that “such steps should be deliberate, concrete and targeted as clearly as possible towards meeting the obligations”. The Committee for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has also stressed that the Covenant imposes an obligation to “move as expeditiously and effectively as possible towards that goal.” CESCR, General Comment No. 3, The nature of States parties' obligations, U.N. Doc. E/1991/23, annex III at 86 (1991), reprinted in Compilation of General Comments and General Recommendations Adopted by Human Rights Treaty Bodies, U.N. Doc. HRI/GEN/1/Rev.6 at 14 (2003), http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/gencomm/epcomm3.htm (accessed July 15, 2013), para. 9. The diversion of public resources through corruption and mismanagement will generally violate a government’s obligation to “progressively realize” economic, social, and cultural rights because it reduces the available resources a government has to invest in essential services. The Committee has further pointed out that periods of economic crisis may not serve as an excuse for inaction.</P></DIV><DIV id=""ftn90""><P class=""MsoFootnoteText""><A href=""#_ftnref90"" name=""_ftn90"" title=""""><SPAN class=""MsoFootnoteReference""><SPAN><SPAN class=""MsoFootnoteReference""><SPAN>[90]</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></A> CESCR, General Comment No. 15: The Right to Water, U.N.

These equatorial regions have the most predictable weather on Earth, with warm temperatures and regular rainfall. Annual rainfall exceeds 150 centimeters (59 inches), and the temperature varies more during a day than it does over a year. The coolest temperature, about 20° to 23° Celsius (68°-73° Fahrenheit), occurs just before dawn. Afternoon temperatures usually reach 30° to 33° Celsius (86°-91° Fahrenheit). Rain forests experience very little seasonal change, meaning average monthly temperatures remain fairly constant throughout the year.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Tropical wet <mark>climate</mark>s exist in a band extending about 10° of latitude on either side of the Equator. This part of the globe is always under the influence of the intertropical convergence zone. The ITCZ follows a pendulum-like path during the course of a year, moving back and forth across the Equator with the seasons. It moves north during summer in the Northern Hemisphere, and south during the northern winter.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Some tropical wet <mark>climate</mark>s are wet throughout the year. Others experience more rainfall during the summer or winter, but they never have especially dry seasons. The U.S. state of Hawaii; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and Belém, Brazil, are examples of areas with tropical wet <mark>climate</mark>s.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><EM>Tropical Monsoon</EM></DIV><DIV>Tropical monsoon <mark>climate</mark>s are most found in southern Asia and West Africa. A monsoon is a wind system that reverses its direction every six months. Monsoons usually flow from sea to land in the summer, and from land to sea in the winter. </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Summer monsoons bring large amounts of rainfall to tropical monsoon regions. People living in these regions depend on the seasonal rains to bring water to their crops. India and Bangladesh are famous for their monsoon <mark>climate</mark> patterns.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><EM>Tropical Wet and Dry: Savanna</EM></DIV><DIV>Tropical wet and dry <mark>climate</mark>s are sometimes called “savanna” <mark>climate</mark>s after the grassland ecosystem defined by wet and dry periods.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Tropical wet and dry <mark>climate</mark>s sit just outside the ITCZ, near the Equator. They have three seasons. One season is cool and dry—when the warm, moist ITCZ is in the opposite hemisphere. Another season is hot and dry as the ITCZ approaches. The last season is hot and wet as the ITCZ arrives and the region experiences months as a tropical wet <mark>climate</mark>. </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Life in these tropical wet and dry regions depends on the wet season’s rains. During years when rains are light, people and animals suffer through drought. During especially rainy years, regions may experience flooding. Havana, Cuba; Kolkata, India; and Africa’s vast Serengeti Plain are in the wet and dry tropics.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><STRONG>Dry <mark>Climate</mark>s</STRONG></DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Regions lying within the dry <mark>climate</mark> group occur where precipitation is low. There are two dry <mark>climate</mark> types: arid and semiarid. Most arid <mark>climate</mark>s receive 10 to 30 centimeters (4 to 12 inches) of rain each year, and semiarid <mark>climate</mark>s receive enough to support extensive grasslands. </DIV><DIV>Temperatures in both arid and semiarid <mark>climate</mark>s show large daily and seasonal variations. The hottest spots in the world are in arid <mark>climate</mark>s. The temperature in the arid North African town of El Aziza, Libya, reached 58° Celsius (136° Fahrenheit) on September 13, 1922—the highest weather temperature ever recorded.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Although rainfall is limited in all dry <mark>climate</mark>s, there are a few parts of the world where it never rains. One of the driest places on Earth is the Atacama Desert of Chile, on the west coast of South America. Stretches of the Atacama have never received rain in recorded history.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Semiarid regions, such as the Australian Outback, usually receive between 25 and 50 centimeters (10-20 inches) of rainfall every year. They are often located between arid and tropical <mark>climate</mark> regions.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Arid and semiarid <mark>climate</mark>s can occur where the movement of warm, moist air is blocked by mountains. Denver, Colorado, just east of the Rocky Mountains in the U.S., has this type of dry <mark>climate</mark>, known as a “rain shadow.”</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><STRONG>Mild <mark>Climate</mark>s </STRONG></DIV><DIV><STRONG> </STRONG></DIV><DIV>Regions with mild and continental <mark>climate</mark>s are also called temperate regions. Both <mark>climate</mark> types have distinct cold seasons. In these parts of the world, <mark>climate</mark> is influenced mostly by latitude and a region’s position on the continent. </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><EM>Mediterranean</EM></DIV><DIV>Mediterranean <mark>climate</mark>s have warm summers and short, mild, rainy winters. Mediterranean <mark>climate</mark>s are found on the west coasts of continents between 30° and 40° latitude, and along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Mediterranean summers feature clear skies, cool nights, and little rain. The city of Jerusalem, Israel, once had no rain in July for more than 100 years. </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><EM>Humid Subtropical</EM></DIV><DIV>Humid subtropical <mark>climate</mark>s are usually found on the eastern sides of continents. In cities such as Savannah, Georgia, in the U.S.; Shanghai, China; and Sydney, Australia, summers are hot and humid. Winter can be severely cold. Precipitation is spread evenly through the year and totals 76 to 165 centimeters (30-65 inches). Hurricanes and other violent storms are common in these regions.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Weather on both sides of a continent generally becomes cooler as latitude increases. </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>The marine west coast <mark>climate</mark>, a type of mild <mark>climate</mark> typical of cities such as Seattle, Washington, in the U.S. and Wellington, New Zealand, has a longer, cooler winter than the Mediterranean <mark>climate</mark>. Drizzle falls about two-thirds of winter days, and temperatures average about 5° Celsius (41° Fahrenheit). </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><STRONG>Continental <mark>Climate</mark>s</STRONG></DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Areas with continental <mark>climate</mark>s have colder winters, longer-lasting snow, and shorter growing seasons. They are the transition zones between mild and polar <mark>climate</mark>s. Continental <mark>climate</mark>s experience extreme seasonal changes.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>The range of weather in continental <mark>climate</mark> regions makes them among the most spectacular sites for weather phenomena. In autumn, for instance, vast forests put on their annual show of brilliant color before shedding their leaves as winter approaches. Thunderstorms and tornadoes, among the most powerful forces in nature, form mostly in continental <mark>climate</mark>s.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>There are three types of continental <mark>climate</mark>—warm summer, cool summer, and subarctic. All these <mark>climate</mark>s exist only in the Northern Hemisphere. Usually, continental <mark>climate</mark>s are found in the interior of continents.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><EM>Warm Summer</EM></DIV><DIV>Warm summer <mark>climate</mark> regions often have wet summer seasons, similar to monsoon <mark>climate</mark>s. For this reason, this <mark>climate</mark> type is also called humid continental. Most of Eastern Europe, including Romania and Georgia, has warm summer <mark>climate</mark>s.</DIV><DIV><EM> </EM></DIV><DIV><EM>Cool Summer</EM></DIV><DIV>Cool summer <mark>climate</mark>s have winters with low temperatures and snow. Cold winds, sweeping in from the Arctic, dominate winter weather. </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>People living in these <mark>climate</mark>s have grown accustomed to the harsh weather, but those unprepared for such cold may suffer. Many of Napoleon Bonaparte’s soldiers, for example, were used to the mild Mediterranean <mark>climate</mark>s of France. Thousands died in bitter cold as they retreated from Russia’s cool summer <mark>climate</mark> in the winter of 1812.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><EM>Subarctic</EM></DIV><DIV>North of regions with cool summer <mark>climate</mark>s are regions with subarctic <mark>climate</mark>s. These regions, including northern Scandinavia and Siberia, experience very long, cold winters with little precipitation. Subarctic <mark>climate</mark>s are also called boreal <mark>climate</mark>s or taiga.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><STRONG>Polar <mark>Climate</mark>s</STRONG></DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>The two polar <mark>climate</mark> types, tundra and ice cap, lie within the Arctic and Antarctic Circles near the North and South Poles. </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><EM>Tundra</EM></DIV><DIV>In tundra <mark>climate</mark>s, summers are short, but plants and animals are plentiful. Temperatures can average as high as 10° Celsius (50° Fahrenheit) in July. Wildflowers dot the landscape, and flocks of migratory birds feed on insects and fish. Whales feed on microscopic creatures in the region’s cold, nutrient-rich waters. People have adapted to life on the tundra for thousands of years. </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><EM>Ice Cap</EM></DIV><DIV>Few organisms survive in the ice cap <mark>climate</mark>s of the Arctic and Antarctic. Temperatures rarely rise above freezing, even in summer. The ever-present ice helps keep the weather cold by reflecting most of the Sun’s energy back into the atmosphere. Skies are mostly clear and precipitation is low. In fact, Antarctica, covered by an ice cap a mile thick, is one of the largest, driest deserts on Earth.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><STRONG>High Elevation <mark>Climate</mark>s</STRONG></DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Many geographers and climatologists have modified the Köppen classification system over the years, including geographer Glen Trewartha, who added a category for high-elevation <mark>climate</mark>s.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>There are two high elevation <mark>climate</mark> types: upland and highland. Upland <mark>climate</mark>s occur on high plateaus, or flat-topped mountains. The Patagonian Plateau, in southern South America, has an upland <mark>climate</mark>. </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Highland <mark>climate</mark>s occur on mountains. </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Both highland and upland <mark>climate</mark>s are marked by very different temperatures and levels of precipitation. Climbing a lofty mountain or reaching a plateau can be like moving toward the poles. On some mountains, such as Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, the <mark>climate</mark> is tropical at the base and polar at the summit. Often, high-elevation <mark>climate</mark> differs from one side of the mountain to the other.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><STRONG>Influence of <mark>Climate</mark></STRONG></DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>The enormous variety of life on Earth is largely due to the variety of <mark>climate</mark>s that exist and the <mark>climate change</mark>s that have occurred in the past.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><mark>Climate</mark> has influenced the development of cultures and civilizations. People everywhere have adapted in various ways to the <mark>climate</mark>s in which they live. </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><EM>Clothing</EM></DIV><DIV>Clothing, for example, is influenced by <mark>climate</mark>. Indigenous Arctic cultures of Europe, Asia, and North America, for example, developed warm, durable, fur and animal-skin clothing. This clothing was necessary for survival in the icy <mark>climate</mark> near the North Pole. Many parkas worn by Arctic peoples are not only insulated, but waterproof. This combats both the frigid temperatures and precipitation found in polar <mark>climate</mark>s.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Lightweight, papery tapa cloth, on the other hand, is part of many cultures in the warm, humid <mark>climate</mark>s of Polynesia, in the South Pacific Ocean. Tapa cloth was traditionally made from dried leaves, coconut fibers, and breadfruit bark. Tapa cloth is delicate and loses strength when wet, which would be deadly near the poles but only inconvenient near the Equator.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><EM>Shelter</EM></DIV><DIV><mark>Climate</mark> also influences how civilizations construct housing. For instance, the ancient Anasazi people of southern North America built apartments into tall cliffs. The sheltered, shady area kept residents cool in the hot, dry desert <mark>climate</mark>.  </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>The yurt is a part of the identity of many cultures across the windy, semi-arid steppe of Central Asia. Yurts are a type of original “mobile home,” a portable, circular dwelling made of a lattice of flexible poles and covered in felt or other fabric. Yurts protect residents from fierce winds, and their portability makes them an ideal structure for nomadic and semi-nomadic herding cultures on the grassland. </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><EM>Agriculture</EM></DIV><DIV>The development of agriculture was very dependent on <mark>climate</mark>. Ancient agricultural civilizations, such as those in Mesopotamia and India, flourished where the <mark>climate</mark> was mild. Communities could grow crops every season, and experiment with different types of crops, livestock, and farming techniques. </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>The mild, Mediterranean <mark>climate</mark> in which the Roman Empire developed, for instance, allowed farmers to cultivate crops such as wheat, olives, grapes, barley, and figs. Livestock included cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and even honeybees.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Like the ancient Romans, ancient cultures of the Amazon basin in South America were also able to develop agricultural practices.  The chief domesticated trees in the Amazon were mostly harvested for food and medicine: Brazil nuts, Inga ynga fruit (commonly known as “ice-cream beans”), Amazon tree grapes, abiu (another tropical fruit), and cacao fruits (whose seeds are known as cocoa beans).</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Today, farmers are still in tune with the <mark>climate</mark>. They plant certain crops according to the expected amount of rainfall and the length of the growing season. When the weather does not follow the typical <mark>climate</mark> pattern, it can mean hard times for farmers and higher food costs for consumers.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><STRONG><mark>Climate Change</mark></STRONG></DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><mark>Climate</mark> does not change from day to day like weather, but it does change over time. The study of historic <mark>climate change</mark> is called paleoclimatology.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><mark>Climate change</mark>s happen slowly over hundreds or even thousands of years. For example, periodic glacial periods have covered large portions of Earth with ice caps. Some paleoclimatology evidence shows that the Sahara Desert was once covered by ocean during a warm “wet age.” </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><mark>Climate change</mark> can happen for many reasons. The movement of tectonic plates, volcanic activity, and the tilt of Earth’s axis all have effects on <mark>climate</mark>. For example, after the eruption of the island volcano of Krakatoa, Indonesia, in 1883, winters and even summers in Asia and Europe were colder and darker. Volcanic ash blocked the sun. Farmers had to adjust to shorter, weaker growing seasons. <mark>Climate</mark>s around the world were changed for years. </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>The so-called “Little Ice Age” was a period of <mark>climate change</mark> extending from the 12th through the 19th centuries. The Little Ice Age was not a true glacial period, but describes colder <mark>climate</mark>s around the world. In Europe, canals in Great Britain and the Netherlands were often frozen solid, allowing for ice skating. In North America, European colonists reported especially harsh winters. Even Africa experienced severe changes in temperature and precipitation. Mountain ranges in Ethiopia and Mauritania were permanently snow-capped. The bustling trade city of Timbuktu, Mali, was flooded more than a dozen times by the Niger River, a phenomenon that has not happened since.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><EM>Global Warming</EM></DIV><DIV>Since the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century, human activity has begun to impact <mark>climate</mark>. The current period of <mark>climate change</mark> is sometimes called “global warming.”</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Global warming is often associated with a runaway “greenhouse effect.” The greenhouse effect describes the process of certain gases (including <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (<mark>CO2</mark>), methane, nitrous oxide (N2O), fluorinated gases, and ozone) trapping solar radiation in a planet's lower atmosphere. Greenhouse gases let the sun’s light shine onto the Earth’s surface, but they trap the heat that reflects back up into the atmosphere. In this way, they act like the glass walls of a greenhouse.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon and keeps Earth warm enough to sustain life. However, human activities that include burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at an unprecedented rate.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>The current period of <mark>climate change</mark> has been documented by rising temperatures, melting glaciers, and more intense weather phenomena. </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Our planet’s temperature has risen about 1.1° C (2° F) since the late 19th century. Sixteen of the last 17 warmest years on record have occurred in the 21st century. According to NASA, not only was 2016 the warmest year on record, but eight of the 12 months that make up the year were the warmest on record for those respective months.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>The current period of <mark>climate change</mark> is also associated with the massive retreat of glaciers, ice sheets, and sea ice. Warmer temperatures have reduced the glaciers of Montana’s Glacier National Park from 150 in 1850 to just 26 today. In 2017, one of the largest icebergs ever recorded entered the ocean as a huge chunk of the Larsen C ice shelf broke off the Antarctic Peninsula. Warmer ocean temperatures and warmer ambient air temperatures likely contributed to the fracturing of the ice shelf and the massive Antarctic ice sheet associated with it. Finally, both the extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice has declined rapidly during the past several decades. The famed Northwest Passage, the treacherous route connecting the North Atlantic and North Pacific ocean basins, is now habitually free of ice and safe enough for cruise ships to navigate.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Melting glaciers and ice sheets, as well as expansion of seawater as it warms, have contributed to unprecedented sea level rise. Sea level rises at about 2.3 millimeters (.2 inch) every year, contributing to up to 900% more frequent flooding in coastal areas.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Increasing temperatures can change the <mark>climate</mark> impacts and even the classification of a region. For instance, low-lying islands may be flooded as seawater rises. The populations of island nations such as Maldives or Comoros have been forced to contemplate becoming “<mark>climate</mark> refugees”—people forced to leave their homes and migrate to a different region.  </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV>Heat in the atmosphere may increase the interaction of diverse weather systems. Unusually arid <mark>climate</mark>s in a semi-arid region may prolong droughts, for instance. In regions with mild <mark>climate</mark>s, the increased atmospheric moisture associated with humid <mark>climate</mark>s may increase the likelihood of hurricanes and typhoons.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><mark>Climate change</mark> is also impacting organisms and species range. Organisms that have adapted to one <mark>climate</mark> may have to migrate or adapt to warmer temperatures. Manatees, for instance, are marine mammals native to tropical waters. As temperatures increase, manatees have been migrating as far north as New York City, New York. Polar bear populations, on the other hand, are venturing further south as Arctic sea ice becomes more scarce.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><mark>Climate change</mark> can be mitigated through reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. This can mean investing in new technologies, relying more on renewable energy sources, making older equipment more energy-efficient, or changing consumer behavior.</DIV></SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></LI><LI><DIV class=""ng-panel-tab-content""><TABLE class=""ng-table ng-table-striped ng-table-condensed ng-table-sortable"" data-ng-tablesort=""""><THEAD><TR><TH class=""ng-sortable ng-sorted-asc"">Term</TH></TR></THEAD></TABLE></DIV></LI></UL></SECTION></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

What do they mean?  </P><P>Meteorologists use the phrase bombogenesis to describe a sudden and extreme drop in barometric pressure of <A href=""https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/bombogenesis.html"">at least 24 millibars</A> over 24 hours, which leads to rapid intensification of a mid-latitude cyclone. We are used to hearing about North Atlantic cyclones during summer and fall—its the meteorological term for hurricanes—and now winter storm Grayson is drawing moisture from a similar cyclonic circulation that will bring blizzard conditions as it <A href=""https://twitter.com/StuOstro/status/948354423893495809"">moves northeast just offshore of the US east coast</A>.</P><H3>Winter weather and global warming</H3><P>With cold temperatures and icy conditions leaving the continental US reeling over the New Year, it might seem counter-intuitive to say that we’re still experiencing global warming. But as my colleague Peter Frumhoff puts it, saying that <mark>climate change</mark> isn’t occurring because of the cold in the eastern US is “<A href=""http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2017/12/29/tl-marsh-<mark>climate</mark>-change.cnn"">like saying if everyone around me is wealthy then poverty is not a problem…local weather is not an indicator of changes in <mark>climate</mark>.</A>”</P><P>Global warming is exactly that: global.

This <A href=""http://cci-reanalyzer.org/wx/DailySummary/#t2anom"">map from the University of Maine <mark>Climate Change</mark> Institute</A> showing the deviations from average temperature for this time of year demonstrates this concept well—much of the continental US may be unusually cold right now but most of the rest of the world is well above average (Figure 1).</P><DIV id=""attachment_55807"" style=""max-width: 860px"" class=""wp-caption alignnone""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Figure 1: Temperature departure from average for this time of year.

One way or another, the scientific community will reach consensus—just as it has with <mark>climate change</mark> more broadly.</P><P>Assessments will shift toward keeping track of the changing percentage of contribution from <mark>climate change</mark> to the altered jet stream. And we’ll really know consensus is reached when this research is incorporated into longer-term outlooks for winter forecasts. In fact, a <A href=""http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/BAMS-D-16-0259.1"">recent publication</A> suggests that if the Arctic indicators—such as the strength or weakness of the polar vortex—were better incorporated into current winter forecasts, we could have <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/27092017/polar-vortex-cold-snap-arctic-ice-loss-global-warming-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">two- to six-week previews of the winter temperatures</A> in the northern hemisphere just like we get our 10-day forecast today.</P><P>If predictions become reliable enough, this could help cities and counties plan to distribute snow removal equipment to regions that will need it well in advance of storms.

Warming generally causes plants that are below their optimum temperature to grow faster, with obvious benefits.

Further, as temperatures continue to rise and drought periods increase, crops will be more frequently exposed to temperature thresholds at which pollination and grain-set processes begin to fail and quality of vegetable crops decreases.

It describes changes in the atmosphere over time scales ranging from weeks to decades to millions of years. These changes can be caused by natural processes internal to the Earth, such as continental drift, which affects ocean currents, external forces, such as variations in sunlight intensity, or human activities. “Global warming” has come to refer to an increase in average global temperatures as influenced by increased greenhouse gas concentrations without regard to other factors that may cause <mark>climate</mark> to change</P><P style=""font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.4em;"">Natural, long-term changes occur in response to fluctuations in the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth, changing ocean currents, formation or loss of ice sheets, and many other causes. Global <mark>climate</mark>s also vary naturally in response to shorter-term events, such as volcanoes, which send sun-blocking particles into the stratosphere to cool the Earth, or the Pacific Ocean event known as El Niño, which affects global wind patterns, rainfall, temperatures, and other <mark>climate</mark> features thousands of miles away.</P><P style=""font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.4em;"">In addition to these natural causes of <mark>climate</mark> variability, human activities influence <mark>climate</mark> in many ways. Land use changes, such as irrigation of historically semi-arid areas for farmland, paving and development of sprawling urban areas, draining of wetlands, and emissions of greenhouse gases or aerosols into the atmosphere are all human activities that can affect the Earth’s <mark>climate</mark> system. Perhaps the most significant human influence today is the increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (<mark>CO2</mark>), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxides (NOx), which contribute to a general warming of our planet (Figure 1).</P><TABLE border=""0"" align=""center"" style=""width: 500px;""><TBODY><TR><TD><P style=""font-size: 12px; text-align: justify;""><STRONG>Figure 1.</STRONG> Global temperature shifts over the past 140 years.

Water vapor and clouds cause most of the Earth’s greenhouse effect, accounting for about 90% of the total heat-retaining capacity of the atmosphere. Two bases for the conclusion that human activity has contributed to recent trends in <mark>climate change</mark> are: 1) observations that atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations have increased from about 280 parts per million (ppm) to nearly 400 ppm over past 150 years while global average temperatures have warmed about 1.25° degrees Fahrenheit (°F), though the temperature vs. CO<SUB>2</SUB> correlation is not perfect, and 2) scientific theories of atmospheric physics and heat transfer.

Because of heat island effects, weather stations that are located near cities show warmer temperatures than nearby rural areas. Analyses of long-term records in Florida indicate that most rural weather stations have experienced a cooling trend in average temperatures while those near urban areas have had a warming trend. Large areas of Alabama and Georgia that were used for row crop agriculture (corn and cotton) have been planted to forests, which may have led to a net cooling of the local environment. Most global or even regional temperature analyses (like Figure 3) can not account for these site-specific factors.</P><P style=""font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.4em;"">Rainfall is among the most important <mark>climate</mark> variables for agriculture and water resource management. Since 1895, annual total rainfall in the three Southeast states shows great year-to-year variability, with rainfall increasing about 10% for all three states during the past century (Figure 4). State and regional averages of annual total rainfall mask a great deal of the variation among and even within counties and variability in timing of rainfall within each year. Southeast rainfall totals are strongly influenced by tropical storms. One notable change over the past century is an increased frequency of rainfall events of two inches or more. While these storms increase the total annual rainfall, they are less useful to agriculture than smaller rainfall events distributed evenly during the growing season.</P><TABLE border=""0"" align=""center"" style=""width: 500px;""><TBODY><TR><TD><P style=""font-size: 12px; text-align: justify;""><STRONG>Figure 4.</STRONG> Annual total rainfall averaged for Alabama, Florida, and Georgia from 1895 through 2006.

The science is currently conflicted, with some studies showing an increase in Atlantic hurricane frequency and intensity and others showing that storm frequency follows a 30- to 50-year cycle associated with changes in ocean currents. Recent claims that hurricane frequency has increased may merely reflect better detection of storms in the post-satellite era. Figure 5 shows annual numbers of Atlantic basin hurricanes and tropical storms since 1855. Several periods of increased activity can be seen in the late 1800’s, the 1930’s, the 1950’s, and from 1995-2005. Relatively inactive periods occurred around 1920, 1970, and 1985. There is a general trend of increasing activity over the whole period, but whether that is real or just an artifact of poor detection of storms before aircraft reconnaissance or satellites is a subject of intense debate.</P><TABLE border=""0"" align=""center"" style=""width: 500px;""><TBODY><TR><TD><P style=""font-size: 12px; text-align: justify;""><STRONG>Figure 5.</STRONG> Numbers of hurricanes and tropical storms for the Atlantic Basin from 1850 to 2005.

The simple theory is that a warming planet will lead to warmer sea surface temperatures, which fuel hurricanes, thereby causing more and stronger storms. Other studies show that warming will lead to more El Niño events, which hinder hurricane development. Climatologists are working hard to resolve these discrepancies, but there is too much uncertainty now to predict how <mark>climate change</mark> will affect hurricanes.</P><H4>What are the <mark>climate</mark> projections for the Southeast USA?</H4><P style=""font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.4em;"">Forecasting weather and <mark>climate</mark> is not an exact science. Projections of <mark>climate change</mark> are based on <mark>climate</mark> models, which are complex computer programs that attempt to describe how the atmosphere will behave through time in response to the forces that act upon it. The computer models try to mimic how <mark>climate</mark> variables might respond to greenhouse gases and other projected results of human activities over the next 100 years. According to the 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC), these models indicate that global average surface temperatures may rise from 3°F to 7°F by the year 2099.</P><P style=""font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.4em;"">History has shown that global increases in temperature are not evenly distributed. For this reason, one cannot simply add 3°F to 7°F to existing temperatures in the Southeast for an idea of future <mark>climate</mark>. More importantly, a changing <mark>climate</mark> will likely not affect just the average temperature, but also the occurrence of extreme events and the variability of temperature over time and space. So far, we do not yet know whether droughts, floods, heat waves, freezes, or storms will become more or less frequent.</P><P style=""font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.4em;"">Another impact of <mark>climate change</mark> is on the height of the sea level. As average global ocean temperatures increase, ocean water expands and sea levels rise. The Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> estimates that sea level will to rise from 8 to 23 inches by 2099. In the Southeast, sea level has risen steadily over the last 100 years at a rate of 8.5 inches per century with no apparent acceleration.</P><P style=""font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.4em;"">To summarize, the <mark>climate</mark> of the Southeast is likely to change in the next decades. While the extent of these changes is subject of intense debate, we need to prepare for the challenges posed by <mark>climate change</mark> by becoming a more efficient society, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, identifying vulnerable sectors of society, and developing adaptation strategies.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""footer""><DIV class=""footerText""><DIV class=""custom""><P style=""text-align: center;"">© Florida <mark>Climate</mark> Center, Florida State University Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies 2000 Levy Avenue, Room 241, Building A, Tallahassee, FL 32306-2741 Phone: (850) 644-3417 or (850) 644-0719, Fax: (850) 644-4841 </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

                   Agriculture both contributes to <mark>climate change</mark> and is affected by <mark>climate change</mark>. The EU needs to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions from agriculture and adapt its food-production system to cope with <mark>climate change</mark>. But <mark>climate change</mark> is only one of many pressures on agriculture. Faced with growing global demand and competition for resources, the EU’s food production and consumption need to be seen in a broader context, linking agriculture, energy, and food security.

A complex and increasingly globalised system of production and delivery has developed over time to meet our need for food and for different flavours. In today’s world, a fish caught in the Atlantic might be served within days in a restaurant in Prague alongside rice imported from India. Similarly, European food products are sold and consumed in the rest of the world.  </P><H2>Agriculture contributes to <mark>climate change</mark></H2><P>Before reaching our plates, our food is produced, stored, processed, packaged, transported, prepared, and served. At every stage, food provisioning releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Farming in particular releases significant amounts of methane and nitrous oxide, two powerful greenhouse gases. Methane is produced by livestock during digestion due to enteric fermentation and is released via belches. It can also escape from stored manure and organic waste in landfills. Nitrous oxide emissions are an indirect product of organic and mineral nitrogen fertilisers.</P><P>Agriculture accounted for 10% of the EU’s total greenhouse-gas emissions in 2012. A significant decline in livestock numbers, more efficient application of fertilisers, and better manure management reduced the EU’s emissions from agriculture by 24% between 1990 and 2012.</P><P>However, agriculture in the rest of the world is moving in the opposite direction. Between 2001 and 2011, global emissions from crop and livestock production grew by 14%. The increase occurred mainly in developing countries, due to a rise in total agricultural output. This was driven by increased global food demand and changes in food-consumption patterns due to rising incomes in some developing countries. Emissions from enteric fermentation increased 11% in this period and accounted for 39% of the sector's total greenhouse-gas outputs in 2011.</P><P>Given the central importance of food in our lives, a further reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions from agriculture remains quite challenging. Nevertheless, there is still potential to further reduce the greenhouse-gas emissions linked to food production in the EU. A better integration of innovative techniques into production methods, such as capturing methane from manure, more efficient use of fertilisers, and greater efficiency in meat and dairy production (i.e. reducing emissions per unit of food produced) can help.</P><P>In addition to such efficiency gains, changes on the consumption side can help to further lower greenhouse-gas emissions linked to food. In general, meat and dairy products have the highest global footprint of <mark>carbon</mark>, raw materials, and water per kilogramme of any food. In terms of greenhouse-gas emissions, livestock and fodder production each generate more than 3 billion tonnes of CO<SUB>2</SUB> equivalent. Post-farm transport and processing account for only a tiny fraction of the emissions linked to food. By reducing food waste and our consumption of emission-intensive food products, we can contribute to cutting the greenhouse-gas emissions of agriculture.</P><H2><mark>Climate change</mark> affects agriculture</H2><P>Crops need suitable soil, water, sunlight, and heat to grow. Warmer air temperatures have already affected the length of the growing season over large parts of Europe. Flowering and harvest dates for cereal crops are now happening several days earlier in the season. These changes are expected to continue in many regions.</P><P>In general, in northern Europe agricultural productivity might increase due to a longer growing season and an extension of the frost-free period. Warmer temperatures and longer growing seasons might also allow new crops to be cultivated. In southern Europe, however, extreme heat events and reductions in precipitation and water availability are expected to hamper crop productivity. Crop yields are also expected to vary increasingly from year to year due to extreme weather events and other factors such as pests and diseases.</P><P>In parts of the Mediterranean area, due to extreme heat and water stress in summer months, some summer crops might be cultivated in winter instead. Other areas, such as western France and south-eastern Europe, are expected to face yield reductions due to hot and dry summers without the possibility of shifting crop production into winter.</P><P>Changes in temperatures and growing seasons might also affect the proliferation and the spreading of some species, such as insects, invasive weeds, or diseases, all of which might in turn affect crop yields. A part of the potential yield losses can be offset by farming practices, such as rotating crops to match water availability, adjusting sowing dates to temperature and rainfall patterns, and using crop varieties better suited to new conditions (e.g. heat- and drought-resilient crops).</P><P>Land-based food sources are not the only food sources affected by <mark>climate change</mark>. The distribution of some fish stocks has already changed in the Northeast Atlantic, affecting the communities relying on these stocks throughout the supply chain. Along with increased maritime shipping, warmer water temperatures can also help facilitate the establishment of invasive marine species, causing local fish stocks to collapse.</P><P>Some <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>-adapt.eea.europa.eu/web/guest/eu-adaptation-policy/funding/esi"">EU funds</A>, including the <A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/clima/publications/docs/06-<mark>climate</mark>_mainstreaming_fact_sheet-eafrd_en.pdf"">European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development</A>, Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and loans from the European Investment Bank, are available to help farmers and fishing communities to adapt to <mark>climate change</mark>. There are also other funds under the CAP aimed at helping to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from agricultural activities.</P><H2>Global market, global demand, global warming…</H2><P>In line with projected population growth and changes in dietary habits in favour of higher meat consumption, the global demand for food is expected to grow by up to 70% in the coming decades. Agriculture is already one of the economic sectors with the largest environmental impact. This substantial increase in demand will unsurprisingly create additional pressures. How can we meet this increasing global demand while at the same time reducing the impacts of European food production and consumption on the environment?</P><P>Reducing the amount of food produced is not a viable solution. The <A class=""external-link"" href=""http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Agricultural_production_-_crops"" target=""_self"" title="""">EU is one of the world’s largest food producers</A>, producing around one eighth of the global cereal output, two thirds of the world’s wine, half of its sugar beet, and three quarters of its olive oil<STRONG>. </STRONG>Any reduction in key staples is likely to jeopardise food security in the EU and in the world, and increase global food prices. This would make it harder for many groups around the world to access affordable and nutritious food<STRONG>. </STRONG></P><P>Producing more food out of the land that is already used for agriculture often requires heavier use of nitrogen-based fertilisers, which in turn release nitrous oxide emissions and contribute to <mark>climate change</mark>. Intensive agriculture and fertiliser use also release nitrates to the soil and to water bodies. Although not directly linked to <mark>climate change</mark>, high concentrations of nutrients (especially phosphates and nitrates) in water bodies cause eutrophication. Eutrophication promotes algae growth and depletes oxygen in the water, which in turn has severe impacts on aquatic life and water quality.</P><P>Whether in Europe or the rest of the world, meeting the growing demand for food by using more land would have serious impacts on the environment and the <mark>climate</mark>. The areas most suitable to agriculture in Europe are already cultivated to a large extent. Land, especially fertile agricultural land, is a limited resource in Europe and across the world.</P><P>Converting forest areas into agricultural land is also not a solution as this process is a source of greenhouse-gas emissions. Similar to many other land-use changes, deforestation (currently occurring mainly outside the European Union) also puts biodiversity at risk, further undermining nature’s ability to cope with <mark>climate change</mark> impacts (such as absorbing heavy rainfall).</P><H2>Competing demands</H2><P>It is clear that the world will need to produce more food and that key resources are limited. Agriculture has high impacts on the environment and the <mark>climate</mark>. Moreover, <mark>climate change</mark> affects — and will continue to affect — how much food can be produced and where.</P><P>Who gets to produce what and where is a socio-political question and is likely to become more controversial in the future. The global competition for these essential resources, especially with the pending impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>, is driving developed countries to purchase large patches of agricultural land in less-developed countries. Such land purchases and <mark>climate change</mark> impacts raise questions about food security in developing countries in particular. Food security is not only a matter of producing sufficient quantities of food, but also of having access to food of sufficient nutritional value.</P><P>This complex problem requires a coherent and integrated policy approach to <mark>climate change</mark>, energy, and food security. Faced with <mark>climate change</mark> and competition for scarce resources, the entire food system will need to transform itself and be much more resource efficient while continuously reducing its environmental impacts, including its greenhouse-gas emissions. We need to increase yields while reducing our dependence on agrochemicals, to reduce food waste, and to reduce our consumption of resource-intensive and greenhouse gas-intensive foods such as meat.</P><P>In doing this, we must also remember that farmers can play a key role in maintaining and managing Europe’s biodiversity. They are also a critical component of the rural economy. Therefore, policy measures to tackle this highly complex problem of food and the environment should take into consideration agriculture’s impacts on the environment and its socio-economic importance for many communities.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""relatedItems""><H2>Related content</H2><DIV class=""sorter_ctl"" style=""margin-bottom: 1.5em; display:none;""><LABEL for=""sort_by""><SPAN>Sort by:</SPAN></LABEL></DIV><DIV class=""visualNoMarker""><H3 class=""notoc"">News and articles</H3><DIV><DIV class=""photoAlbumEntry"" data-effective=""1435658400000"" data-title=""Living in a changing <mark>climate</mark>""><A href=""https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/living-in-a-changing-<mark>climate</mark>"" title=""Living in a changing <mark>climate</mark>"" class=""""><SPAN class=""photoAlbumEntryTitle"">Living in a changing <mark>climate</mark></SPAN><SPAN class=""photoAlbumEntryDescription"">Our <mark>climate</mark> is changing.

Heat can exacerbate <A href=""http://c2es.org/content/drought-and-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">drought</A>. This, in turn, can encourage more extreme heat, as the sun’s energy acts to heat the air and land surface, rather than to evaporate water. Hot, dry conditions also increase the risk of <A href=""http://c2es.org/content/wildfires-and-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">wildfires</A>.</P><H3>Human Health</H3><P>Extreme heat is the deadliest natural disaster in the United States, killing more people on average (<A href=""http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6136a6.htm"">about 600 per year</A>) than hurricanes, lightning, tornadoes, earthquakes, and floods combined. The Billion Dollar Weather Disasters database compiled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration lists <A href=""http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/events"">heat waves as four of the top 10 deadliest U.S. disasters since 1980</A>. Two heat waves in 1980 and 1988 were particularly deadly and account for the vast majority of extreme weather-related deaths in the database, with Hurricane Katrina (1,833 deaths) as the only non-heat wave event that caused more than 500 fatalities.</P><P>High humidity and elevated nighttime temperatures appear to be key ingredients in causing heat-related illness and mortality. Heat stress occurs in humans when the body is <A href=""http://ephtracking.cdc.gov/show<mark>Climate</mark>ChangeExtremeHeat.action"">unable to cool itself effectively</A>. Normally, the body can cool itself through sweating, but when humidity is high, sweat will not evaporate as quickly, potentially leading to heat stroke. When there’s no break from the heat at night, it can cause discomfort and lead to health problems, especially for the poor and elderly. <A href=""http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2008BAMS2613.1"">Daily minimum temperatures in the U.S.</A> are increasing slightly faster than daily maximum temperatures.</P><H3>Agriculture</H3><P>High temperatures at night can be particularly damaging to agriculture. Some <A href=""http://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/hot-nights-rob-cn-yields_2-ar24826"">crops require cool night temperatures</A>, and heat stress for livestock rises when <A href=""http://www.ars.usda.gov/Main/docs.htm?docid=15623"">animals are unable to cool off at night</A>. Heat-stressed cattle can experience declines in milk production, slower growth, and reduced conception rates.</P><H3>Energy</H3><P>Higher summer temperatures will <A href=""http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/sectors/energy"">increase electricity demand</A> for cooling, as has been observed over the past 20 years. At the same time, higher temperatures <A href=""https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/07/f2/20130716-Energy%20Sector%20Vulnerabilities%20Report.pdf"">lower the ability of transmission lines to carry power,</A> possibly leading to electricity reliability issues during heat waves. Although warmer winters will reduce the need for heating, modeling suggests that total U.S. energy use will increase in a warmer future. In addition, as rivers and lakes warm, their capacity for absorbing waste heat from power plants declines. This can reduce the thermal efficiency of power production, make it difficult for power plants to comply with environmental regulations regarding their cooling water.</P><H2>How to Build Resilience</H2><P>Communities can bolster their resilience and reduce the impacts of extreme heat by:</P><UL><LI>Creating heat preparedness plans, identifying vulnerable populations, and opening cooling centers during extreme heat.</LI><LI>Using green roofs, improved building materials, and shaded building construction to <A href=""https://www.epa.gov/heat-islands"">reduce the urban heat island effect</A>.</LI><LI>Pursuing energy efficiency to reduce demand on the electricity grid, especially during heat waves.</LI><LI>Shading and cooling livestock, breeding livestock selectively for heat tolerance, and switching to growing more heat-resistant crops.</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV><SECTION id=""post-extras"" class=""page-section accordion""><DIV id=""extras-related"" class=""accordion-section""><DIV class=""section-content""><DIV class=""accordion-head section-head""><H3>Related Content</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></BODY></HTML>"

Mrs Fotabong emphasised the importance of building capacity at all levels, especially for smallholder farmers and institutions in order to attain the goal of 25 million African farmers practising <mark>climate</mark>-smart agriculture by 2025.  </P><P>Mrs Fotabong also stated that the Africa CSA Alliance needs to recognise interventions that respond to both the challenges and opportunities that <mark>climate change</mark> brings.  “In order to make rural transformation attainable, <mark>climate change</mark> needs to be also mainstreamed in the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP), Africa’s instrument for agricultural growth and economic development,” Mrs Fotabong said.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Mrs Fotabong with H.E Ato  Sileshi Getahum ( Ethiopian State Minister for Agriculture)Hon Zenevu Tadesse, Minister for Women, Children &amp; Youth Affairs;Minister Councillor Ms Tove Stub, Norwegian Embassy, Addis Ababa</STRONG></P><P>At the 31st African Union Summit (Malabo, June 2014) the Heads of State and Government were clear in their resolve to commit to action on the agriculture-<mark>climate change</mark> nexus issue. In the Summit Decisions on NEPAD, the Heads of State and Government endorsed the NEPAD programme on agriculture <mark>climate change</mark> including its components on women empowerment, intensified support to small-holder farmers and the setup of an African <mark>Climate</mark> Smart-Agriculture Coordination Platform as means in pursuit of what was endorsed as the African Union Vision to have at least 25 million farm households practicing CSA by 2025.</P><P>To achieve this, Africa is leading a country-driven and regionally-integrated Initiative that will provide the tools for action and platform for partnerships that will deliver results.  Centred on NEPAD, the initiative will be fully aligned with and an integral part of the CAADP framework, as well as cultivating the necessary multi-sectorial engagements, including the environment, natural resources and <mark>climate change</mark> policies and programmes.</P><P>To support countries, a virtual and physical African Alliance was established where knowledge is exchanged to identify best practice and partnerships across stakeholder groups are catalysed. The Alliance will also foster a coherent African CSA Agenda as well as sustaining the collective power and urge for action. It will also facilitate assessment of individual (country, region, sector, etc.) performance against continental and even global benchmarks.</P><P>Ethiopian State Minister for Agriculture, Sileshi Getahun stated that the Africa CSA Alliance provides an opportunity to take concrete action in <mark>climate change</mark> for the benefit of African agriculture. &quot;The field trip for participants at the Forum to Ethiopian projects will enable them to witness first-hand the interventions in <mark>climate</mark>-smart agriculture in the Ethiopian national strategy. We need to show the rest of the world our adaptive capacity and up-scale such practices,&quot; Mr Getahun said.</P><P>Minister for Women, Children and Youth Affairs, Zenevu Tadesse called on all stakeholders – including governments, civil society and private sector - to support local systems and expand to scale up <mark>climate</mark>-smart agriculture.  The Minister stressed that the Africa CSA Alliance is a very important instrument towards achieving <mark>climate</mark>-smart agriculture in Africa.</P><P>Minister Councillor Tove Stub of the Norwegian Embassy in Addis Ababa, maintained that the Africa CSA Alliance is an important milestone following the 2014 Malabo Declaration in dealing with the challenges of <mark>climate change</mark> for the benefit of smallholder farmers.</P><P>Launched as Africa’s Strategic Approach for Food Security &amp; Nutrition in the Face of <mark>Climate Change</mark>, the Africa CSA Alliance was attended by about 150 representatives and participants from Governments, Regional Economic Communities, Farmers’ Organisations, Private Sector, Civil Society, specialised agencies and development partners.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

However, the impacts of global change on the stability of biodiversity have not been systematically studied in terms of both large spatial (continental drift) and temporal (from the last inter-glacial period to the next century) scales. Therefore, we analyzed the current geographical distribution pattern of Plecoptera, a thermally sensitive insect group, and evaluated its stability when coping with global change across both space and time throughout the Mediterranean region—one of the first 25 global biodiversity hotspots. Regional biodiversity of Plecoptera reflected the geography in both the historical movements of continents and the current environmental conditions in the western Mediterranean region. The similarity of Plecoptera assemblages between areas in this region indicated that the uplift of new land and continental drift were the primary determinants of the stability of regional biodiversity. Our results revealed that <mark>climate change</mark> caused the biodiversity of Plecoptera to slowly diminish in the past and will cause remarkably accelerated biodiversity loss in the future. These findings support the theory that <mark>climate change</mark> has had its greatest impact on biodiversity over a long temporal scale.</P></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION aria-labelledby=""introduction""><DIV class=""serif article-section js-article-section cleared clear"" id=""introduction-section""><H2 class=""js-section-title section-title position-relative strong tighten-line-height background-gray-light pt20 pb6 pl0 pr20 standard-space-below mq640-pt20 mq640-pb10 mq640-pl20 mq640-mt0 extend-left small-space-above"" id=""introduction"">Introduction</H2><DIV class=""pl20 mq875-pl0 js-collapsible-section"" id=""introduction-content""><P>Global biodiversity is undergoing extensive change at an unprecedented rate due to the combined forces of ecological, environmental, evolutionary, and historical stressors<SUP><A id=""ref-link-section-1"" title=""Wiens, J.

Thus, it is likely that the temperature difference between the last inter-glacial and last glacial maximum was not large enough to affect Plecoptera richness in this region, although higher temperature during the last inter-glacial could probably shrink the global distribution of some species at higher altitude (particularly considering the mountainous nature of the study region) without causing a sharp decline in the diversity of Plecoptera. Nevertheless, temperature increase in the future could have primarily negative effects on biodiversity by dramatically reducing the number of available habitats (<A href=""#f3"" data-track=""click"" data-track-action=""figure anchor"" data-track-label=""link"">Fig. 3c</A>)<SUP><A id=""ref-link-section-43"" title=""Tierno de Figueroa, J.

In comparison to this optimal precipitation range, the mean precipitation in the last glacial maximum was relatively high (876 mm), whereas the last inter-glacial was in the optimal range (763 mm). Nevertheless, the predicted Plecoptera richness was lower in the 2080 s due to its low mean precipitation (592 mm) and high mean temperature (16.9 °C). This trend suggests that the biodiversity of Plecoptera decreased due to <mark>climate change</mark> in the past 120–140 Ka. The decline in Plecopteran biodiversity occurred slowly in the past (i.e., loss of 0.58 species per Ka since the last inter-glacial and 1.39 species per Ka since the last glacial maximum) and at remarkably high speed in the future (i.e., loss of 160 species per Ka in the next 100 years). Possible explanations for this increase in the speed of Plecopteran decline include ecological constraints (e.g., dispersal capacity) and physical limits or geographical isolation (e.g., due to high mountains, deserts, or oceans).

Our study not only provides evidence for the profound effects of human-induced global change on regional biodiversity but also illustrates a more complete picture of biodiversity stability in the context of both spatial and temporal scales. The high rate of species loss, currently thought to be 0.58 to 160 species per Ka, may be much stronger than previously thought.

Sediment delivery to Martin Lake occurs predominantly during the warm-season when the lake is ice-free and abundant rainfall from southerly derived rainstorms mobilizes watershed sediment.

In contrast, Mississippian socio-political systems show evidence for increased stress and conflict during the transition to the LIA as the PNA switched to a more positive phase and midcontinental summer precipitation was significantly reduced. Following this pattern, the ultimate abandonment of urban centers across the lower Ohio and central Mississippi River valleys between 1350–1450 CE was associated with sustained drought. These climatic-archaeological associations support the idea that although socio-political dynamics were likely an important factor in midcontinental Native American cultural changes during the last millennium, background climatic conditions set the stage for cultural change and the movement of peoples by either favoring or discouraging the stability of large agriculturally based midcontinental Native American populations and associated socio-political systems.</P></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION aria-labelledby=""methods""><DIV class=""serif article-section js-article-section cleared clear"" id=""methods-section""><H2 class=""js-section-title section-title position-relative strong tighten-line-height background-gray-light pt20 pb6 pl0 pr20 standard-space-below mq640-pt20 mq640-pb10 mq640-pl20 mq640-mt0 extend-left small-space-above"" id=""methods"">Methods</H2><DIV class=""pl20 mq875-pl0 js-collapsible-section"" id=""methods-content""><H3 class=""h3 strong mb4"">Core collection and processing</H3><P>Ten surface and long sediment cores were retrieved from Martin Lake’s profundal zone between May and October 2013 using a modified Livingstone piston corer, a modified surface piston corer and freeze corer<SUP><A id=""ref-link-section-102"" title=""Cushing, E.

On the one hand, the crops grown in the genetically homogeneous monocultures that are typical of chemical farming are vulnerable to the <mark>climate</mark> extremes that are becoming more frequent and more violent as a result of global warming.

Photo: © Basso Cannarsa</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Fortunately, there is a viable and <mark>sustainable</mark> alternative to industrial agriculture. It consists of a variety of agricultural techniques, based on ecological principles that have been refined over the past century and are being adopted around the world, especially in the past two decades. With these techniques, healthy biodiverse foods are grown in decentralized, community-oriented, energy-efficient, and <mark>sustainable</mark> ways. These ecologically-oriented farming techniques include organic-certified farming, permaculture, and biodynamic farming. In recent years, the term “agroecology” has increasingly been used as a unifying term, referring to both the scientific basis and the practice of an agriculture based on ecological principles.</P><P>Agroecology is <mark>sustainable</mark> because it dramatically reduces the need for off-farm inputs, is dependent on the saving and sharing of seeds versus purchased seeds, and can be fostered through farmer-to-farmer education not through expensive inputs. Of critical importance for the future of agriculture is the observation that resilience to extreme <mark>climate</mark> events is closely linked to agricultural biodiversity, which is a key characteristic of agroecology. Agroecological practices are labor-intensive and community-oriented, thereby reducing poverty and social exclusion. In these ways, agroecology is able to raise agricultural productivity in ways that are economically viable, environmentally benign and socially uplifting.</P><P>When soil is farmed organically, moreover, its <mark>carbon</mark> content increases, and by sequestering <mark>carbon</mark> in this way organic farming can contribute to reducing the concentration of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere. In other words, agroecology not only is more resistant to global warming than industrial agriculture; it also helps stabilize the <mark>climate</mark>, whereas industrial agriculture aggravates <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>In recent years, agroecology has taken off around the world. The rapid growth of the peasant-led international movement <A href=""https://viacampesina.org/en/"">La Via Campesina</A> and of the <A href=""https://www.ifoam.bio/"">International Federation of Organic Agricultural Movements</A> speak to the interest in scaling up this approach to agriculture. Organizations like <A href=""https://www.socla.co/en/"">SOCLA</A> in Latin America and the Campesino a Campesino (farmer-to-farmer) network in Central America have reached thousands of farmers across the region. All together, these groups have helped to train hundreds of thousands of farmers in agroecological approaches, proving that the shift from industrial agriculture to agroecological practices is not only urgently needed, but is also practical and can be achieved without new technologies or expensive investments. What we need now to scale up agroecology from successful local and regional projects to the global level is political will and visionary global leadership.</P><P><EM>This article is an abstract of a longer piece, “<A href=""http://www.abocashop.com/en/agricoltura-e-cambiamento-climatico-2"">Agricolutura e Cambiamento Climatico</A>” (Agriculture and <mark>Climate Change</mark>) published in Italian by <A href=""http://www.abocamuseum.it/en/"">Aboca</A>.</EM></P><P><EM><A href=""http://www.fritjofcapra.net/"">Fritjof Capra</A>, Ph.D., is a scientist, educator, activist, and author of many international bestsellers that connect conceptual changes in science with broader changes in worldview and values in society.</EM></P><P><EM><A href=""https://annalappe.com/"">Anna Lappé</A> is a national bestselling author, a respected advocate for sustainability and justice along the food chain and an advisor to funders investing in food system transformation.

We addressed these uncertainties by applying different impact models at site, regional and continental scales, and by separating the variation in simulated relative changes in ecosystem performance into the different sources of uncertainty and variation using analyses of variance. The crop and ecosystem models used output from a range of global and regional <mark>climate</mark> models (GCMs and RCMs) projecting <mark>climate change</mark> over Europe between 1961–1990 and 2071–2100 under the IPCC SRES scenarios. The projected impacts on productivity of crops and ecosystems included the direct effects of increased CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration on photosynthesis. The variation in simulated results attributed to differences between the <mark>climate</mark> models were, in all cases, smaller than the variation attributed to either emission scenarios or local conditions. The methods used for applying the <mark>climate</mark> model outputs played a larger role than the choice of the GCM or RCM. The thermal suitability for grain maize cultivation in Europe was estimated to expand by 30–50% across all SRES emissions scenarios. Strong increases in net primary productivity (NPP) (35–54%) were projected in northern European ecosystems as a result of a longer growing season and higher CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations. Changing water balance dominated the projected responses of southern European ecosystems, with NPP declining or increasing only slightly relative to present-day conditions. Both site and continental scale models showed large increases in yield of rain-fed winter wheat for northern Europe, with smaller increases or even decreases in southern Europe. Site-based, regional and continental scale models showed large spatial variations in the response of nitrate leaching from winter wheat cultivation to projected <mark>climate change</mark> due to strong interactions with soils and <mark>climate</mark>. The variation in simulated impacts was smaller between scenarios based on RCMs nested within the same GCM than between scenarios based on different GCMs or between emission scenarios.</P></SECTION><DIV class=""KeywordGroup"" lang=""en""><H2 class=""Heading"">Keywords</H2><SPAN class=""Keyword"">Root Mean Square Error </SPAN><SPAN class=""Keyword"">Winter Wheat </SPAN><SPAN class=""Keyword"">General Circulation Model </SPAN><SPAN class=""Keyword"">Regional <mark>Climate</mark> Model </SPAN><SPAN class=""Keyword"">Emission Scenario </SPAN><DIV id=""test-keyword-message"" class=""u-interface u-italic"">

<BODY> <P class=""note"">Source: Haas and Köpke, 1994. *Manure is not included.</P><P>In order to compare farming systems, they are subdivided into emissions due to burning of oil and fuel (direct energy) and the use of oil and fuel for the production and transport of fertilizers, machinery and synthetic pesticides (indirect energy).</P><P><mark>CO2</mark> emissions per hectare of organic agriculture systems are 48 to 66 percent lower than in conventional systems<A href=""#96""><SUP>96</SUP></A>. Haas and Köpke (1994) calculated the <mark>CO2</mark> emissions of German organic farms to be 0.5 tonnes of <mark>CO2</mark> per hectare whereas in conventional agriculture the amount was 1,3 tons, a difference of 60 percent (Table 5). The main effects of organic agriculture that are responsible for this difference are<A href=""#97""><SUP>97</SUP></A>:</P><UL><LI>the maintenance and increase of soil fertility by the use of farmyard manure;</LI><LI>  the omission of synthetic fertilizers and synthetic pesticides;</LI><LI>  the lower use of high energy consuming feedstuff.</LI></UL><P>In organic agriculture, almost 70 percent of the <mark>CO2</mark> was due to fuel consumption and the production of machinery, while in conventional systems 75 percent of the <mark>CO2</mark> emissions are ascribed to N-fertilizers, feedstuff and fuels<A href=""#98""><SUP>98</SUP></A>.</P><H3>Soils as a sink for atmospheric <mark>CO2</mark></H3><P>Soil <mark>carbon</mark> levels have decreased under agricultural land use<A href=""#99""><SUP>99</SUP></A>. <mark>Sustainable</mark> agricultural strategies comprising recycling of organic matter, tightening internal nutrient cycles, and low- or no-tillage practices may rebuild organic matter levels and reduce losses from the system. Mixed farming with manure amendment leads to higher organic matter levels in soil. Combined with other organic agriculture techniques Drinkwater <I>et al.</I> (1998) showed, in a long-term experiment, a considerable gain in soil organic matter compared to a conventional system at comparable yield. Many long-term experiments in the world support the cognition that organic fertilization (animal manure, green manure, catch and cover crops) rebuild soil organic matter<A href=""#100""><SUP>100</SUP></A>. The accumulation of organic matter in the soil is restricted by soil type, <mark>climate</mark> and management factors and will reach a certain saturation level.</P><P>Haas and Köpke (1994) calculated that, despite generally lower crop yields, plant productivity in organic agriculture accounts for almost the same organic matter return as in a conventional system (Table 5). This is due to the more diverse crop rotations and the longer period the soil is covered by plants. On the other hand, organic crop yields in developing countries may be considerably higher than the national average, which has implications on organic matter return and <mark>carbon</mark> sinks<A href=""#102""><SUP>102</SUP></A>. A 20 percent increase in soil organic matter as a result of organic agriculture would result in an estimated amount of 9 tonnes <mark>carbon</mark> per ha, which is in line with the results over a 15-year period<A href=""#103""><SUP>103</SUP></A>. Smith <I>et al.</I> (1997) calculated a considerable potential increase of soil <mark>carbon</mark> when manure, straw-recycling, minimal tillage, reforestation and energy-saving plant production are combined. </P><H3>Nitrous dioxide</H3><P>Nitrous oxide emissions not only contribute severely to the greenhouse effect but also to the depletion of stratospheric ozone. Almost 90 percent of the global atmospheric N2O is formed during the microbial transformation of nitrate (NO3-) and ammonia (NH4+) in soils and water. </P><P>Globally, agriculture contributes to 65-80 percent of total N2O, mainly from nitrogenous fertilizers on cultivated soils, cattle and feedlots. In OECD countries the agricultural contribution to N2O emissions is estimated at 58 percent<A href=""#104""><SUP>104</SUP></A>. N2O emissions from soils are due to the unproductive loss of mobile N. Any nitrogen input (mineral and organic fertilizers, biologically fixed N, crop residues) and also the mineralization of nitrogen compounds in soils rich in organic matter contribute to the emission of N2O. Especially in agricultural soils elevated N2O production depends on the nitrogen fertilization level<A href=""#105""><SUP>105</SUP></A>. The above-mentioned inputs are proposed as determinants of N2O emissions by the Inter-Governmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>. </P><P>Tropical ecosystems, currently an important source of N2O (and NO) are often phosporus-limited rather than being N-limited like the Northern hemispheric terrestrial ecosystems. Nitrogen fertilizer inputs into these phosphorus-limited ecosystems generate N2O (and NO) fluxes that are 10 to 100 times greater than the same fertilizer addition to nearby N-limited ecosystems<A href=""#106""><SUP>106</SUP></A>. </P><P>The ban on synthetically-produced mineral nitrogen in organic agriculture confines the productivity to the natural system limits (i.e. N-fixation) or the limits defined by the annual nutrient balance of the farm, including imported fodder and organic fertilizers. Organic agriculture therefore is likely to emit less N2O due to restricted intensity because of:</P><UL><LI>a systemically lower N-input;</LI><LI>less N from organic manure due to lower livestock densities;</LI><LI>  a higher C/N ratio of applied organic manure and less available mineral nitrogen in the soil as a source for denitrification<A href=""#107""><SUP>107</SUP></A>;</LI><LI>the permanent plant cover in organic systems which results in a more efficient uptake of mobile nitrogen in soils, thus reducing the potential and risk for N2O emissions. </LI></UL><P>As Tilman (1998) points out &quot;<mark>sustainable</mark> and productive ecosystems have tight internal cycling of nutrients, a lesson that agriculture must relearn&quot;.</P><P class=""tabletitle"">Table 6:  Pathways of organic agriculture to directly or indirectly reduce agricultural trace gas emissions </P><H4>Methane </H4><P>Agriculture is believed to account for roughly two-thirds of the total man-made CH4<A href=""#108""><SUP>108</SUP></A> mainly from paddy rice fields, burning of biomass and ruminants (enteric fermentation and animal waste treatment). Aerobic agricultural soils, however, are considered sinks for atmospheric CH4. Fertilization with mineral nitrogen has been shown to inhibit CH4-oxidation in soils. The lower N-fertilization level in organic agriculture may therefore exhibit an advantage for CH4-oxidation. </P><P>However, no data exist on the effects of organic agriculture on methane emissions. The emission of methane by ruminants is probably not affected by organic production. The higher proportion and lower productivity of ruminants in organic agriculture may, however, lead to slightly higher emissions of CH4. On the other hand, standards and breeding programmes aim at longevity in order to prolong the productive period in relation to the unproductive life of young cattle. Correspondingly the &quot;unproductive&quot; CH4-emission of calves and heifers may be reduced. </P><P class=""sumtitle"">Organic agriculture not only enables ecosystems to better adjust to the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> but also offers a major potential to reduce the emissions of agricultural greenhouse gases.</P><P class=""boxtitle"">Organic agriculture and desertification</P><P>The degradation of drylands is called desertification. Desertification is caused by overcultivation, overgrazing and deforestation and results in soil exhaustion and soil erosion. It diminishes soil productivity, reduces food production, deprives the land of its vegetative cover, and negatively impacts areas not directly affected by its symptoms, by causing floods, soil salinization, deterioration of water quality, and silting of rivers, streams and reservoirs<A href=""#109""><SUP>109</SUP></A>. </P><P class=""sumtitle"">Organically-managed soils have a high potential to counter soil degradation as they are more resilient both to water stress and to nutrient loss. </P><P>Organically-managed soils have a high potential to counter soil degradation as they are more resilient both to water stress and to nutrient loss. Organic farmers feed their soils with organic fertilizers, and they can thus enhance degraded and problematic soils. The water and nutrient retention capacity is increased thanks to a high level of organic matter and permanent soil cover. Micro-organisms have a good feeding base and create a stable soil structure. Due to the resulting high moisture retention capacity the amount of water needed for irrigation can be reduced substantially. </P><P>There is little scientific evidence demonstrating organic agriculture's potential for combating desert-ification but several practical examples of organic agriculture systems in arid areas show how organic agriculture can help bring degraded lands back to fertility.</P><P>A SEKEM biodynamic farm in Egypt cultivates 70 hectares of desert near Cairo. By using organic and biodynamic agricultural methods (composting, mulching, cover cropping) the desert sands were converted into fertile soil, supporting livestock and bees.</P><P>Organic agriculture can create suitable micro-<mark>climate</mark>s in dry areas. For example in Kenya, the International Centre for Research in Agroforestry runs organic agriculture projects to fight drought<A href=""#110""><SUP>110</SUP></A>. Agro-forestry generates multiple benefits, including erosion control and moisture retention. In Tanzania, the Chagga home gardens on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro, where certified organic coffee is produced, provide an excellent example of agroforestry. The system includes a diversity of cash and subsistence crops (e.g. bananas, coffee, yams, and beans) as well as livestock. Cattle and pigs are kept in stables (&quot;zero grazing&quot;) and manure is recycled as fertilizer. The home gardens are designed to maximise diversity. Elaborate patterns of vertical zonation provide a range of sunny and cooler conditions for different species<A href=""#111""><SUP>111</SUP></A>.</P><P>Organic agriculture can counter erosion successfully. While in conventional agriculture in the tropics even flat soil gets eroded due to the use of herbicides and the lack of soil cover, in organic agriculture permanent soil cover is an intrinsic part the system. In trials on a Cuban citrus plantation, the Cuban Citrus Institute and Swiss FiBL use <I>Teranamus labialis, Arachis pintoi, Neonotonia wightii</I> and other legumes. These locally-adapted leguminous crops can help restore degraded soils very fast, successfully suppress weed, fix nitrogen and prevent erosion. FiBL-experiments have also shown that cover crops do not compete with the main crops for nutrients or water. The precondition is, however, that the system be properly set up and adapted to soil and climatic conditions (e.g. FiBL sandwich-system; see Box 13). Soil life is enormously enhanced, and water retention capacity is increased. The cover crop plants also serve as habitats for predators.</P><P class=""boxtitle"">Box 13:  The FiBL sandwich-system</P><P class=""boxnewpara"">The sandwich-system was developed by the Swiss Research Institute for Organic Farming, FiBL. It consists of a small strip with cover crops directly under the tree strip. Left and right of the cover strip the soil is tilled with relatively simple tools. Thus the local amount of weed-free soil is the same as with tillage of the whole tree strip.</P><P class=""boxnewpara"">This system supports a fully organic nutrition concept (efficient application of compost on tilled strips).</P><P class=""boxnewpara"">Compost and fertilizers are applied mechanically in the tilled strips and tilled 5 cm into the soil. </P><P class=""boxnewpara"">The alleyway is covered by a leguminous cover-crop. In dry areas it is often not possible to have a permanent crop cover. In these areas it is therefore recommended to have a green cover crop during the rainy season which should be supplemented with dead mulch. </P><P class=""boxnewpara"">The advantage of this system is that it achieves several aims of organic agriculture. Soil cover with specially selected valuable crops, avoidance of erosion and desiccation, target-oriented organic fertilization, avoidance of competition for water in the area of the fine roots. </P><P class=""note"">Source: Kilcher (FiBL).</P><P>Organic agriculture can also counter salinization problems. The Fazenda Tamanduà in Brazil is situated in an area severely affected by salinization caused by inappropriate irrigation techniques. It is a certified organic farm with more than 3 000 hectares of which 650 hectares are cropped with mango trees. Due to the arid conditions, irrigation is the prerequisite to agricultural production. Conventional agriculture in the area uses the water from the rivers and causes further salinization by over-irrigation with already salinated water. Fazenda Tamanduà limits its water use to rain water, which is collected in rainwater collection basins, thus avoiding the depletion of the water resources. At the same time the salinization of soils is considerably reduced. Fertilization regimes include grazing of cattle under mango trees as well as application of composted manure. The organic substance acts like a sponge in the soil, and fields thus fertilized have a higher moisture retention capacity and therefore need less irrigation. </P><P>Even though the adoption of organic agriculture seems a feasible alternative in arid areas, there is a range of constraints to adopting organic agriculture systems or even individual techniques. These include a lack of knowledge, lack of organic materials, insecure land tenure, the perception of organic agriculture as being old fashioned and the fact that extension services promote chemical farming. The promotion of organic agriculture through education and training, in countries suffering desertification, could be a key to bringing degraded land back into production.</P><P class=""tabletitle"">Table 7:  Assessment of organic agriculture's impact on the environment compared to conventional agriculture based on a multi-criteria analysis</P><H4>Figure 4: Relative environmental impact assessment of organic, low-input, and high-input dairy farm production systems in Bavaria </H4><H3>Organic agriculture and comprehensive evaluations</H3><P>Comprehensive environmental impact assessments of agriculture can be assessed by using the OECD indicator categories. One example is the life cycle assessment of dairy farm production systems undertaken by Haas <I>et al.</I> (2001). The authors compared three dairy farm production systems of the Bavarian Alps: organic, low-input conventional, and high input conventional. Figure 4 presents the results related to the area. Organic agriculture showed the best results in all indicator categories: biotic and abiotic impacts, landscape and animal welfare.</P><P>Another study compared organic, conventional and integrated apple production systems. The yields were similar in all three systems. The organic and the integrated system had higher soil quality and potentially lower negative environmental impact. The organic system was more profitable and used energy more efficiently than the other systems. Significant differences were found between the three apple production systems considering environmental impacts of pesticide use. Organic apple production achieved a 4.7 times better rating than integrated production and a 6.2 better rating than conventional production<A href=""#112""><SUP>112</SUP></A>.</P><P>Another example of a comprehensive environmental impact assessment is given by Stolze <I>et al.</I> (2000). Table 7 presents the evaluation of almost 400 studies comparing organic with conventional or integrated farming in Europe. The results show the final average assessment and the confidence interval. Compared to conventional agriculture, organic agriculture in most categories performs better, or much better, in terms of environmental impact.</P><H3>Conclusions</H3><P>Organic agriculture provides a wide range of environmental goods and services, namely:</P><H3>Soil</H3><UL><LI>  Organic matter content is usually higher in organically-managed soils, indicating higher fertility and stability of organic soils as well as moisture retention capacity, which reduce the risk of erosion and desertification.</LI><LI>  Organically-farmed soils have significantly higher biological activity and a higher total mass of micro-organisms, making for more rapid nutrients recycling and improved soil structure. While the proportion of soluble nutrient fractions is lower on organically managed soils, there is no decrease in organic yields since higher biological activity and higher mycorrhizal root colonization counteract nutrient deficiency.</LI></UL><H3>Water</H3><UL><LI>Organic agriculture poses no risk of ground and surface water <mark>pollution</mark> through synthetic pesticides. </LI><LI>Nitrate leaching rates per hectare are significantly lower in organic agriculture compared to conventional systems.</LI></UL><H3>Air</H3><UL><LI>Organic agriculture enables ecosystems to better adjust to the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> and has a major potential for reducing agricultural greenhouse gas emissions.</LI><LI>Organic agricultural strategies, by recycling organic matter and tightening internal nutrient cycles, contribute to <mark>carbon</mark> sequestration.</LI></UL><H3>Energy</H3><UL><LI>Organic agriculture performs better than conventional agriculture on a per hectare scale, both with respect to direct energy consumption (fuel and oil) and indirect consumption (synthetic fertilizers and pesticides). </LI><LI>Efficiency of energy use of organic farms is high.</LI></UL><H3>Biodiversity</H3><UL><LI>Agriculture genetic resources, including also insects and micro-organisms, have all been shown to increase when land is farmed organically. </LI><LI>Wild flora and fauna within and around organic farms are more diverse and abundant than in conventional or integrated agriculture. </LI></UL><H3>Ecological services</H3><UL><LI>Organic agriculture offers vast food resources and shelter for beneficial arthropods and birds, thus contributing to natural pest control.</LI><LI>Organic agriculture contributes to the conservation and survival of pollinators, thanks to the banning of synthetic chemical pesticides and herbicides and the enhanced ecosystem diversity. </LI></UL><H3>Landscape</H3><UL><LI>Organic agriculture systems create diversified landscapes, which contributes to functional diversity and aesthetical values. </LI><LI>The establishment of semi-natural habitats within organic systems and the avoidance of pesticide use contribute to maintaining the biological connectivity and the larger ecological web, which benefit both agriculture and nature conservation.</LI></UL><P>As a final assessment, it can be stated that well managed organic agriculture leads to more favourable conditions at all environmental levels. Organic agriculture counteracts resource depletion (soil, water, energy, nutrients), contributes positively to the problems associated with <mark>climate change</mark> and desertification and can help to maintain and enhance biodiversity at a global scale. </P><P>Scientific evidence of the environmental benefits of organic agriculture for the Southern Hemisphere is rare, but many experiences suggest that the points listed above also apply to the tropics and subtropics. There is urgent need, however, to investigate the interactions between organic agriculture practices and natural resources dynamics in these areas. </P><P class=""sumtitle"">As a final assessment, it can be stated that well managed organic agriculture leads to more favourable conditions at all environmental levels.</P></BODY></HTML>"

Each year Africa produces an average of just over 1 metric ton of the greenhouse gas <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide per person, according to the U.S. Department of Energy’s <EM>International Energy Annual 2002</EM>. The most industrialized African countries, such as South Africa, generate 8.44 metric tons per person, and the least developed countries, such as Mali, generate less than a tenth of a metric ton per person. By comparison, each American generates almost 16 metric tons per year. That adds up to the United States alone generating 5.7 billion metric tons of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide per year (about 23% of the world total, making it the leading producer), while Africa as a whole contributes only 918.49 million metric tons (less than 4%). It is a cruel irony that, in many experts’ opinion, the people living on the continent that has contributed the least to global warming are in line to be the hardest hit by the resulting <mark>climate change</mark>s.</P><P id=""__p2"">“The critical challenge in terms of <mark>climate change</mark> in Africa is the way that multiple stressors—such as the spread of HIV/AIDS, the effects of economic globalization, the privatization of resources, and conflict—converge with <mark>climate change</mark>,” says Siri Eriksen, a senior research fellow in sociology and human geography at the University of Oslo. “It is where several stressors reinforce each other that societies become vulnerable, and impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> can be particularly severe.” She cites the example of the 2002 drought-triggered famine in southern Africa, which affected millions due partly to populations’ coping capacity being weakened by HIV/AIDS.</P><P id=""__p3"" class=""p"">“<mark>Climate change</mark> could undo even the little progress most African countries have achieved so far in terms of development,” says Anthony Nyong, a professor of environmental science at the University of Jos in Nigeria. With <mark>climate change</mark> has come an increase in health problems such as malaria, meningitis, and dengue fever, he says. This means that the few resources these poor countries have that would have been channeled into essential projects to further economic development must instead be put toward health crisis after health crisis, providing emergency care for the people.</P></DIV><DIV id=""__sec1"" class=""tsec sec""><H2 class=""head no_bottom_margin"" id=""__sec1title"">Models of Change</H2><P id=""__p4"" class=""p p-first"">Africa may already be feeling the effects of global warming, says Isaac Held, a senior research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, and more marked effects are likely to come, according to models developed by <mark>climate</mark> scientists around the world. Projected effects of global warming on precipitation throughout the world can be summarized in a single sentence, according to Held: areas that already get a lot of rainfall—such as the equatorial and subpolar rain belts—will get more, and areas that get little—such as the subtropical dry zones—will get less.</P><P id=""__p5""><mark>Climate</mark> models suggest that subtropical Africa south of the equator will follow this trend, and a plausible case can be made that global warming has already reduced rainfall in that region. In a paper published in the September 2004 issue of the <EM>International Journal of Climatology</EM>, NOAA scientist Pingping Xie and colleagues wrote, “Large decreasing rainfall trends were widespread in the Sahel from the late 1950s to the late 1980s; thereafter, Sahel rainfall has recovered somewhat through 2003, even though the drought conditions have not ended in the region.” The study also found that major multiyear oscillations have appeared to occur more frequently and to be more extreme since the late 1980s.</P><P id=""__p6"">About 300,000 people died in a prolonged drought in the Sahel during the 1970s. Until recently the scientific community attributed that drought to the severe loss of vegetation accompanying such factors as overgrazing and overpopulation; according to this model, the reduction in vegetation meant greater reflectivity of the Earth’s surface and less moisture being returned to the atmosphere, with a net drying effect. But now, Held says, “we think of that drought as having been driven by changes in the ocean temperatures.”</P><P id=""__p7"">New <mark>climate</mark> models posit that precipitation changes are occurring because of alterations in the temperature gradient between the Southern and Northern hemispheres. “When the [ocean] waters are warmer in the Northern Hemisphere, rains are attracted farther north, and when they are warmer in the Southern Hemisphere, it doesn’t get as far north,” Held explains.</P><P id=""__p8"">But it is a subject of debate, he says, whether the changes in temperature gradient that caused the Sahel drought were due to natural variability of the oceans or were partly the result of man-made changes in the composition of the atmosphere. There is as yet no consensus among <mark>climate</mark> modelers on the most likely future trend of Sahel rainfall, he emphasizes.</P><P id=""__p9"">Still, climatologists agree that warming is happening. In <EM><mark>Climate Change</mark> 2001: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability</EM>, the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> Working Group II reported, “The historical <mark>climate</mark> record for Africa shows warming of approximately 0.7°C [1.3°F] over most of the continent during the twentieth century; a decrease in rainfall over large portions of the Sahel . . . and an increase in rainfall in east central Africa.”</P><P id=""__p10"" class=""p p-last"">Accompanying the Sahel droughts has been an increase in dust storms, although whether these storms are a result of the droughts or a cause has been a subject of controversy. Research published in the 22 May 2001 issue of the <EM>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</EM>, for example, presents an analysis that demonstrated that the particles in Sahel dust storms weren’t able to absorb much water. As a result, they did not form cloud condensation nuclei, as is usually expected in such dust particles, and so they suppressed rainfall and exacerbated the droughts. In addition to effects on weather, dust motes averaging less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter are in the range of particles that research shows may have serious health consequences. Such dust can carry with it a variety of hitchhikers including bacteria, fungi, and chemical pollutants, all of which may adversely affect health.</P></DIV><DIV id=""__sec2"" class=""tsec sec""><H2 class=""head no_bottom_margin"" id=""__sec2title"">Food Stock Failure</H2><P id=""__p11"" class=""p p-first"">On any continent crop failure means trouble, but in Africa it’s a catastrophe. About 40% of the gross national product of African countries flows from agriculture, and about 70% of African workers are employed in agriculture, most of them on small plots of land. “Africa is full of poor people who are very highly dependent on <mark>climate</mark>-related issues for their livelihoods,” says Bob Scholes, an ecologist at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Pretoria, South Africa. “They are subsistence farmers in often very marginal environments.” African governments are frequently chaotic, ineffective, unstable, and corrupt, adding to the people’s precarious existence.</P><P id=""__p12"">Land ownership changes, less restrictive trade policies, commercialization of the agricultural sector, and increasing impoverishment, along with population growth, have pushed people into farming in dry areas, such as savanna, that not long ago were open to cattle and wildlife grazing, says Jennifer Olson, regional coordinator for land use with the LUCID (Land Use, Change, Impacts, and Dynamics) project at the International Livestock Research Institute in Kenya and a geography professor at Michigan State University. Faced with shrinking open grasslands, once solely pastoral people are settling down and planting crops of their own to supplement their livestock. New farmers tend to be poor, Olson says, and their farms, set in these dry areas, are usually small and thus especially vulnerable to droughts, floods, and other weather hazards associated with <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P id=""__p13"">“Rainfall is the biggest variable for crop and animal production here,” Olson says. “Everything goes up and down depending on how the rainy seasons are going, so <mark>climate change</mark> is going to have a huge impact with the expansion of the number of people doing cropping in the more marginal areas. These tend to be the people on the edge of doing well anyway because there’s not enough rainfall for them to be productive.”</P><P id=""__p14"">According to Robert Mendelsohn, a professor at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, small farmers in Africa are especially vulnerable to changes in precipitation. Only a small number use irrigation or fertilizer of any kind. Larger growers, such as the commercial farms of parts of East Africa, are better able to cope with weather extremes, but they are in the minority.</P><P id=""__p15"" class=""p p-last"">People who depend on livestock will be just as hard-hit as pastures go brown, Mendelsohn says. But in this case smaller spreads fare better than large ones. Big operations are usually committed to herds of cattle, which demand plentiful water and easy-to-reach areas in which to graze. When water is scarce, large pastoralists are forced to move their herds southward to relatively wetter areas that are usually occupied by sedentary farmers, thus precipitating intergroup conflicts. However, people who have just a few animals can switch to goats and sheep, animals that tend to be more inventive when it comes to finding food and water.</P></DIV><DIV id=""__sec3"" class=""tsec sec""><H2 class=""head no_bottom_margin"" id=""__sec3title"">Ecosystem Changes</H2><P id=""__p16"" class=""p p-first"">With changes in land use and <mark>climate</mark>, some areas in East Africa have become drier, Olson says, and water sources are becoming intermittent or disappearing. Streams that used to run year-round are now seasonal. The expansion of agriculture into savannas also blocks migration routes for large animals such as zebras, wildebeest, and elephants, she says.</P><P id=""__p17"">As a result of <mark>climate</mark>-related ecosystem changes, some wild sources of food are also becoming harder to find, says Catherine O’Reilly, an assistant professor of environmental science at Vassar College. The fish stock in the deep Rift Valley lakes of East Africa, for example, are decreasing as average air temperatures rise. These lakes—a chain of fresh and brackish bodies including lakes Malawi, Tanganyika, and Victoria—contain greater biodiversity than any other of the world’s freshwater systems, she says. That diversity depends on algae that are supplied when surface waters mix with nutrient-rich deep waters.</P><P id=""__p18"">“With <mark>climate change</mark>,” O’Reilly explains, “there is less of this mixing, because the [temperature-mediated] density difference between the surface waters and the deep waters has gotten greater, and so it takes more energy to mix deep water up to the surface.” Less algae means less food for the entire food web, and the result, she says, is big decreases in fish catches in all of these lakes.</P><P id=""__p19"">O’Reilly and colleagues reported in the 14 August 2003 issue of <EM>Nature</EM> that <mark>climate change</mark> had contributed to a 30% decline in Lake Tanganyika fish stocks over the past 80 years. Such declines can be disastrous for the villages in the region, where the average income is less than US$250 per year, and where the people depend on the fish from these lakes for all of their protein.</P><P id=""__p20"">When this important food source fades, every aspect of the regional environment is affected. As fish yields go down, increased demands are put upon the land as some fishermen switch to arable farming, O’Reilly says. This in turn leads to more intensified farming, and thus more deforestation, increased erosion, and degradation of the shoreline. Degradation of the shoreline destroys in-shore habitat and spawning grounds for many fish species, further impacting the fish population. “You get a positive feedback loop started,” she says, “whereby a small decrease in productivity in the lakes can cycle through all these factors and impact [yet] another aspect of the fish life-history cycle.”</P><P id=""__p21"">When food sources dry up, Africans also turn to wild game. This can put pressure on already endangered species and potentially expose diners to the diseases these exotic animals carry. A report published in the 12 November 2004 issue of <EM>Science</EM> showed that declining fish stocks in Ghana—down by at least 50% since 1970—corresponded with a demand for “bushmeat” that led to a 76% decline in the numbers of 41 species of mammals, including buffalo, antelope, jackals, monkeys, and elephants.</P><P id=""__p22"">Insects—and with them the diseases they harbor—have also been affected by new climatic conditions, says Jonathan Patz, a physician and associate professor of environmental studies and population health sciences at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. As Africa has warmed, he says, vectorborne diseases—those in which a pathogen is carried from one host to another by pests such as mosquitoes—have increased their range. Malaria, for example, has moved into higher African latitudes as highlands have warmed enough for mosquitoes to breed. (However, other experts, such as Marlies Craig, a malaria researcher at the South African Medical Research Council in Durban, believe that factors besides increasing temperatures, such as increased resistance to drugs, are the cause of this vector spread.) Further, as malaria makes its way into higher latitudes, it reaches people who didn’t develop malaria immunity as children. The result is an increase in adult mortality.</P><P id=""__p23"" class=""p p-last"">Although some areas may become more suitable for some diseases, others may become less so, Patz adds—disease vectors don’t universally seek warmer temperatures. Rather, each has optimum conditions in which it thrives. In North America, for example, Patz says the warmer, wetter temperatures that foster some mosquito growth tend to worsen conditions for the tick that carries Lyme disease. Similarly, research by a team from the Institut Français de Recherche Scientifique pour le Développement en Coopération in Senegal, published in the March 1996 issue of the <EM>American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</EM>, indicated that tickborne borreliosis extended its range out of the Sahel and into West Africa most likely because of the Sahel drought of the 1970s.</P></DIV><DIV id=""__sec4"" class=""tsec sec""><H2 class=""head no_bottom_margin"" id=""__sec4title"">Wages of War</H2><P id=""__p24"" class=""p p-first"">When the apocalyptic horsemen of famine and pestilence appear, war can’t be far behind. Decreasing pastoral lands, decreasing available tillable land, decreasing wild game, and decreasing available water all add up to more strife, Scholes says. “Subtropical dry, arid areas are going to be a huge source of conflict over the next half-century because we still have very, very high population growth rates in those areas, very low economic growth rates, and deteriorating environment,” he says.</P><P id=""__p25"">“Basically,” he adds, “not only are the spillover effects environmental, in terms of dust storms and soil erosion and so forth, but there is also massive spillover of people moving out of [more stressed areas] into better resourced areas.” In relatively developed countries such as Nigeria and South Africa, 30% or more of the population consists of illegal immigrants.</P><P id=""__p26"">Farmers, pastoralists, and the new agropastoralists are already competing for water and suitable agricultural and grazing land, Olson says; regional warming and drying can only be expected to worsen the situation. On occasion, she says, the conflicts that result from this competition can turn violent, although most are settled peacefully.</P><P id=""__p27"" class=""p p-last"">But according to Eriksen, extended periods of increased violent raiding in parts of East Africa have led to loss of livestock and land, and have driven people into a state of destitution that makes them extremely vulnerable to drought events. “Although many conflicts are politically instigated and driven by underlying economic inequities in resource access, rather than <mark>climate change</mark> as such, increasing drought stress can exacerbate conflict and violence,” she says.</P></DIV><DIV id=""__sec5"" class=""tsec sec""><H2 class=""head no_bottom_margin"" id=""__sec5title"">Strategies for Coping</H2><P id=""__p28"" class=""p p-first"">As a reaction to so much bad news, in July 2005 the G8 countries—Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States—approved a pledge to forgive about US$40 billion of debt owed by 18 nations, including 14 African countries. These forgiven debts represent about one-sixth of the total owed by African nations to the G8 nations and international lenders. According to Nyong, relief from these debts will allow these African governments to spend more on local issues related to <mark>climate change</mark>. The G8 leaders also committed to double annual African aid from US$25 billion to US$50 billion.</P><P id=""__p29"">But debt relief isn’t an instant cure. “We really have to spend some time exploring the implications of [debt relief] for rural economies and urban economies,” says David Campbell, a geography professor at Michigan State University who has studied East African communities for more than 25 years. It’s also important, he says, to determine what investment should be made with financial aid to maintain the resilience of societies, both urban and rural, in the face of potential increased climatic variability.</P><P id=""__p30"">Industrialized nations bear another responsibility, Nyong says: “Just as Africa is trying to adapt to these adverse impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>, the developed countries, particularly the G8 countries, should put in place a mechanism to which they are committed to substantially reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. [With Nigeria] having signed the Kyoto protocol, we want to see definite plans articulated to achieving the targets set by the protocol.”</P><P id=""__p31"">Mendelsohn lays out the bottom line: “As the net income of this land deteriorates, it’s not going to be able to sustain the number of bodies that are on it anymore. So the question is, where will these bodies go?” One long-term answer is to try to increase industrialization in Africa to give people other alternatives, to move away from <mark>climate</mark>-sensitive livelihoods and industries toward those that are not <mark>climate</mark>-sensitive—ecotourism has been suggested as one possible replacement for farm income.</P><P id=""__p32"">In the meantime, Campbell says, “It’s important that the G8 outcome be committed over the long term to maintaining [financial aid] policies.” This financial aid, he says, will be vital to the lives of Africa’s poor, who represent an ever increasing segment of African society. And <mark>climate change</mark> is likely to accelerate such societal stratification, he says. People who have at least some wealth will be better able to switch to different crops, buy a different kind of livestock, or combine growing and herding. “Herders who had taken on farming appeared to be less vulnerable to drought than the people who had maintained themselves in terms of subsisting almost entirely on herding,” Campbell says. “So that diversification showed itself to be successful in terms of allowing them to cope with prolonged drought.” However, those Africans who don’t have sufficient wealth to buffer the effects of increasing climatic variability will plunge deeper into poverty.</P><P id=""__p33"" class=""p p-last"">But as much as financial aid is needed, Nyong says, the reality is that no amount of money is going to stop <mark>climate change</mark> from affecting Africa in profound and unpredictable ways. Africa wasn’t able to prevent the buildup of greenhouse gases, he says; “What we are left to do now is to adapt to the buildup.”</P></DIV><DIV id=""unreferenced-ft"" class=""tsec sec headless whole_rhythm""><DIV class=""unreferenced""><DIV id=""largeobj_idm140393331744208"" class=""largeobj-link align_right"" style=""display: none""><A target=""object"" href=""/pmc/articles/PMC1280367/figure/f1-ehp0113-a00534/?report=objectonly"">Open in a separate window</A></DIV><DIV class=""icnblk_cntnt"" id=""lgnd_f1-ehp0113-a00534""><DIV class=""caption""><STRONG>Winds of change.</STRONG><P id=""__p34"">A Somalian girl searches for edible seeds among the dust.

University Park, PA 16802</P><P><B>INTRODUCTION</B></P><P>
Agriculture is the basic activity by which humans live and survive on the earth. Assessing the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on agriculture is a vital task. In both developed and developing countries, the influence of <mark>climate</mark> on crops and livestock persists despite irrigation, improved plant and animal hybrids and the growing use of chemical fertilizers. The continued dependence of agricultural production on light, heat, water and other climatic factors, the dependence of much of the world's population on agricultural activities, and the significant magnitude and rapid rates of possible <mark>climate change</mark>s all combine to create the need for a comprehensive consideration of the potential impacts of <mark>climate</mark> on global agriculture.</P><P>
This chapter compares the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> on agriculture in temperate and tropical regions. These regions differ significantly in their biophysical characteristics of <mark>climate</mark> and soil, and in the vulnerability of their agricultural systems and people to <mark>climate change</mark>. The focus is on the impacts of the <mark>climate change</mark>s projected to occur as a result of higher levels of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere and associated global warming. The projected <mark>climate change</mark>s for the temperate and tropical areas differ in that <mark>climate</mark> models project larger temperature increases in temperate regions than in tropical regions. The projections of changes in the hydrological cycle are more similar but rather uncertain, showing a mixed picture of regional precipitation increases and decreases in both areas.</P><P><B>COMPARISON OF TEMPERATE AND TROPICAL AGRICULTURE</B></P><P>
The tropics are defined as the geographical area lying between 23.5deg. N and 23.5deg.S latitude, while the temperate regions are found above these parallels. Climatologically, the tropics are characterized by high year-round temperatures and weather is controlled by equatorial and tropical air masses. Tropical precipitation is primarily convective. In the more humid tropical regions, annual rainfall is often above 2000 mm and falls in almost all months of the year. In the drier tropics, rainfall can fall below 50 mm, and be very seasonal. The remainder of the region lies between these precipitation regimes, with distinct wet and dry seasons. Agriculture is frequently limited by the seasonality and magnitude of moisture availability.</P><P>
In the mid-latitude temperate zone, weather is controlled by both tropical and polar air masses. Precipitation here occurs along fronts within cyclonic storms. The temperate region also has many different <mark>climate</mark> regions with warmer and cooler temperatures and seasonal rainfall. Temperate agriculture is often characterized a predominantly limited by seasonally cooler temperatures.</P><P>
Reported experiments have shown that even though yield per day is often higher in the tropics, total crop growth season is shorter (Haws <I>et al</I>., 1983). Leaf area expansion and phasic development are faster in the tropics because of higher temperatures during vegetative growth. Nevertheless, crop yields are consistently found to be higher in temperate regions than in the tropics (see <A href=""tab1.gif"">Table 1</A>) (FAO, 1990 Numerous factors contribute to this result. Soils in the humid tropics tend to be highly leached of nutrients and are therefore unproductive because of high temperatures, intense rainfall, and erosion. Soils in the drier tropics are often hampered by accumulations of salt and lack of water (Barrow 1987). Temperate soils are generally viewed as more favorable to agriculture than tropical soils because of higher nutrient levels. However, there are exceptions in both regions, with high productive volcanic and fluvial soils found in the tropics, and poorly developed and infertile soils in temperate regions.</P><P>
Agricultural production is also severely limited in many humid tropical regions by the wide range of weeds, pests, and diseases that flourish in consistently warm and moist <mark>climate</mark>s. The growth of some crops and varieties, which require long hours of daylight to reach maturity, is also limited by the invariable day lengths of the tropics. Solar radiation, which is critical to plant growth, and whose intensity is controlled by the angle of the sun, daylength, and cloudiness, is lower in winter and higher in summer in temperate zones. In the tropics, solar radiation is often limited by cloudiness during the rainy seasons.</P><P>
Agricultural crops and cropping systems have been developed for, and adapted to, these varied regimes of <mark>climate</mark>, soil, diseases and pests (Haws <I>et al</I>., 1983). The main commercial agricultural crops and their adaptations include:</P><P>
(a) Cassava and sugarcane, which only grow in tropical areas and have a crop duration of one year or longer. Cassava is drought resistant, but sugarcane requires irrigation in dry areas.</P><P>
(b) Sorghum, groundnut, and sweet potato, which grow in both tropical and subtropical regions in relatively dry seasons.</P><P>
(c) Rice, which is mainly grown in tropical and subtropical zones in the rainy season or with irrigation.</P><P>
(d) Maize and field beans grow in both zones, preferably with seasons with enough rain</P><P>
(e) Wheat, soybean, and potato are crops of the subtropical and temperate zones and grow in the tropics at high (cooler) elevations.</P><P>
(f) Sugarbeet is grown only in the temperate zone.</P><P>
A number of &quot;luxury&quot; agricultural crops, especially fruit (bananas, pineapples), stimulants (coffee, tea) and spices grow only, or best, in the tropics. Tropical regions are also important in providing winter season produce for temperate zones.</P><P>
In temperate agriculture, plant breeding and fertilizer use produced dramatic yield increases for many crops early in the twentieth century. Similar increases occurred more recently in tropical regions for crops such as wheat, maize and rice, which benefited from the technological package or improved seeds, fertilizer, mechanization and pesticides known as the Green Revolution.</P><P>
In both temperate and tropical regions, irrigation has been developed in areas where dry seasons exist and adequate water can be reserved from other seasons or brought in from adjacent regions.  Irrigation is an important buffer against <mark>climate</mark> variability and <mark>climate change</mark>.  About 20% of the world's cropland is irrigated, mostly in Asia, producing about 40% of the annual crop production.</P><P>
Differences in farming systems, technology and economics also contribute to the yield differences in temperate and tropical regions.  Agriculture in temperate regions is characterized by high levels of inputs (quality seed stock, fertilizer, herbicides and pesticides), and a high degree of mechanization and capitalization.  However, there are wide variations in the use of technology, European agriculture being particularly intensive.  In tropical regions, many farmers cannot afford inputs, and governments cannot afford to subsidize them. In some parts of the tropics, traditional technologies, such as multiple cropping and terracing, act to buffer the system against <mark>climate</mark> variability, conserve soil fertility, and increase yields.</P><P>
In some senses, the tropics are more dependent on agriculture, and therefore more vulnerable to climatic change, than the temperate regions.  As much as 75% of the world's population live in the tropics, and two thirds of these people are reliant on agriculture for their livelihoods. With low levels of technology, land degradation, unequal land distribution, and rapid population growth, many tropical regions are near or exceeding their capacity to feed themselves (<A href=""tab2.gif"">Table 2</A>).</P><P>
Indeed, some authors have argued that the unequal social structures and international position of many tropical countries also increase vulnerability to <mark>climate change</mark>.  Unequal land tenure, high numbers of landless rural dwellers, low incomes and high national debts exacerbate the negative impacts of <mark>climate</mark> variability, as some people have no extra land, job, savings or government assistance to see them through droughts or other climatic extremes (Jodha 1989).  When the economic system is oriented towards export rather than subsistence agriculture, climatic change (as well as low export prices) may threaten the whole national economy and food system.  Those regions that cannot feed their populations depend on cereal imports from the major cereal exporters such as the USA, France, Canada, Australia, Argentina, and Thailand (FAO 1990). All except Thailand would be defined as temperate agricultural producers.</P><P><B>THE INFLUENCE OF <mark>CLIMATE CHANGE</mark> ON CROP PRODUCTION</B></P><P>
At the basis of any understanding of <mark>climate</mark> impacts on agriculture lies the biophysical sciences. The rates of most biophysical processes are highly dependent on <mark>climate</mark> variables such as radiation, temperature, and moisture, that vary regionally. For example, rates of plant photosynthesis depend on the amount of photosynthetically active radiation and levels of atmospheric <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (C02). Temperature is an important determinant of the rate at which a plant progresses through various phenological stages towards maturity. The accumulation of biomass is constrained by the availability of moisture and nutrients to a growing plant.</P><P>
Numerous studies have examined the impacts of past climatic variations on agriculture using case studies, statistical analyses and simulation models (e.g. Nix 1985; Parry 1978; Thompson 1975; World Meteorological Organization 1979). Such studies have clearly demonstrated the sensitivity of both temperate and tropical agricultural systems and nations to climatic variations and changes. In the temperate regions, the impacts of <mark>climate</mark> variability, particularly drought, on yields of grains in North America and the Soviet Union have been of particular concern because of their effects on world food security. In the tropics, drought impacts on agriculture and resulting food shortages have been widely studied, especially when associated with the failure of the monsoon in Asia or the rains in Sudano-Sahelian Africa. In the temperate regions, climatic variations are associated with economic disruptions; in the tropics, droughts bring famine and widespread social unrest (Pierce 1990).</P><P><B>THE BIOPHYSICAL IMPACT OF CLIMATIC CHANCES ASSOCIATED WITH GLOBAL WARMING</B></P><P>
It is frequently assumed that global change will bring higher temperatures, altered precipitation, and higher levels of atmospheric <mark>CO2</mark> (IPCC 1990a). What might these changes mean for the biophysical response of agricultural crops?</P><P><I>Interactions with thermal regimes</I>. Higher temperatures in general hasten plant maturity in annual species, thus shortening the growth stages during which pods, seeds, grains or bolls can absorb photosynthetic products. This is one reason yield are lower in the tropics. Because crop yield depends on both the rate of carbohydrate accumulation and the duration of the filling periods, the economic yields of both temperate and tropical crops grown in a warmer and <mark>CO2</mark>-enriched environment may not rise substantially above present levels, despite increases in net photosynthesis (Rose 1989).</P><P>
Because temperature and tropical regions differ in both current temperature and the temperature rise predicted for <mark>climate change</mark>, the relative magnitudes of combined <mark>CO2</mark> and temperature effects will likely be different in the different regions. In the mid-latitudes, higher temperatures may shift biological process rates toward optima, and beneficial effects are likely to ensue. Increases in temperature will also lengthen the frost-free season in temperate regions, allowing for longer duration crop varieties to be grown and offering the possibility of growing successive crops (moisture conditions permitting). In tropical locations where increased temperatures may move beyond optima, negative consequences may dominate.</P><P>
Both the mean and extreme temperatures that crops experience during the growing season will change in both temperate and tropical areas. Extreme temperatures are important because many crops have critical thresholds both above and below which crops are damaged. Prolonged hot spells can be especially damaging (Mearns <I>et al</I>, 1984). Critical stages for high temperature injury include seedling emergence in most crops, silking and tasseling in corn (Shaw, 1983), grain filling in wheat (Johnson and Kanemasu, 1983), and flowering in soybeans (Mederski, 1983). In general, higher temperatures should decrease cold damage and increase heat damage. Agro-climatic zones are expected to shift poleward as lengthening and warming growing seasons allow new or enhanced crop production (soil resources permitting) (Rosenzweig, 1985).</P><P><I>Changes in hydrological regimes</I>. The hydrological regimes in which crops grow will surely change with global warming. While all GCMs predict increases in mean global precipitation (because a warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapor), decreases are forecast in some regions and increases are not uniformly distributed. The crop water regime may further be affected by changes in seasonal precipitation, within-season pattern of precipitation, and interannual variation of precipitation. Increased convective rainfall is predicted to occur, particularly in the tropics, caused by stronger convection cells and more moisture in the air.</P><P>
Too much precipitation can cause disease infestation in crops, while too little can be detrimental to crop yields, especially if dry periods occur during critical development stages. For example, moisture stress during the flowering, pollination, and grain-filling stages is especially harmful to maize, soybean, wheat and sorghum (Decker <I>et al</I>., 1986).</P><P>
The amount and availability of water stored in the soil, a crucial input to crop growth, will be affected by changes in both the precipitation and seasonal and annual evapotranspiration regimes. Some GCMs predict mid-continental drying the Northern Hemisphere (Manabe and Wetherald, 1986; Kellogg and Zhao, 1988) and other GCM predictions have been interpreted to suggest that the rise in potential evapotranspiration will exceed that of rainfall resulting in drier regimes throughout the tropics and low to mid-latitudes (Rind <I>et al</I>., 1990). Because the soil moisture processes are represented so crudely in the current GCMs, however, it is difficult to associate much certainty with these projections (IPCC, 1990a).</P><P>
Global <mark>climate change</mark> is likely to exacerbate the demand for irrigation water (Adams <I>et al</I>., 1990). Higher temperatures, increased evaporation, and yield decreases contribute to this projection. However, supply of needed irrigation water under <mark>climate change</mark> in uncertain. Where water supplies are diminishing, such as the Ogallala Aquifer in the United States, extra demand might require that some land be withdrawn from irrigation (Rosenzweig, 1990).</P><P><I>Physiological effects of</I> <mark>CO2</mark>. The study of agricultural impacts of trace gas induced <mark>climate change</mark> is complicated by the fact that increasing atmospheric <mark>CO2</mark> has other effects on crop plants besides its alteration of their <mark>climate</mark> regime. These are often called &quot;fertilizing&quot; effects, because of their perceived beneficial physiological nature. Specifically, most plants growing in enhanced <mark>CO2</mark> exhibit increased rates of net photosynthesis. The higher photosynthesis rates are then manifested in higher leaf area, dry matter production, and yield for many crops (Kimball, 1983; Acock and Allen, 1985; Cure, 1985). In several cases, high <mark>CO2</mark> has contributed to upward shifts in temperature optima for photosynthesis (Jurik <I>et al</I>., 1984) and to enhanced growth with higher temperatures (Idso <I>et al</I>., 1987); other studies, however, have not shown such benefits (Jones <I>et al</I>., 1985; Baker <I>et al</I>, 1989).</P><P>
<mark>CO2</mark> enrichment also tends to close plant stomates, and by doing so, reduces transpiration per unit leaf area while still enhancing photosynthesis. The stomatal conductances of 18 agricultural species have been observed to decrease markedly (by 36%, on average) in an atmosphere enriched by doubled <mark>CO2</mark> (Morison and Gifford, 1984). However, crop transpiration per ground area may not be reduced commensurately, because decreases in individual leaf conductance tend to be offset by increases in crop leaf area (Allen <I>et al</I>., 1985). In any case, higher <mark>CO2</mark> often improves water-use efficiency, defined as the ratio between crop biomass accumulation or yield and the amount of water used in evapotranspiration. Increases in photosynthesis and resistance with higher <mark>CO2</mark> have been shown to occur at less than optimal levels of other environmental variables, such as light, water, and some of the mineral nutrients (Acock and Allen, 1985).</P><P>
Temperate crops may benefit more from increasing <mark>CO2</mark> than tropical crops. In crop species with the C3 pathway characteristic of non-tropical plants (e.g., wheat, soybean, cotton) <mark>CO2</mark> enrichment has been shown to decrease photorespiration, the rapid oxidation of recently formed sugars in the light, a process which lowers the efficiency of overall photosynthesis. C4 crops, which are particularly characteristic of tropical and warm arid regions (e.g., maize, sorghum, and millet), are more efficient photosynthetically under current <mark>CO2</mark> levels than C3 plants (because they fix <mark>CO2</mark> into malate in their mesophyll cells before delivering it to the RuBP enzyme in the bundle-sheath cells). Because of this <mark>CO2</mark>-concentrating and photorespiration-avoiding mechanism, experimental data show that C4 plants are less responsive to <mark>CO2</mark> enrichment (Acock and Allen, 1985).</P><P>
The physiological effects of high levels of atmospheric <mark>CO2</mark> described above have been observed under controlled experimental conditions. In the open field, however, their magnitude and significance are still largely untested, and their importance relative to the predicted large-scale climatic effects uncertain. Greenhouse and field-chamber environments tend to be much smaller, less variable, and more protected from wind than field conditions. Furthermore, physiological feedback mechanisms such as starch accumulation or lack of sink (that is, growing, storing, or metabolizing tissue) for the products of photosynthesis may limit the extent to which the &quot;fertilizing&quot; <mark>CO2</mark> effects may be realized. Finally, if trace gas emissions continue to grow unchecked, their <mark>climate</mark> warming effect is projected to continue even up to 2000 ppm (Manabe and Bryan, 1985), but the beneficial boost to photosynthesis appears to level off at about 400 ppm for C4 crops and about 800 ppm for C3 crops (Akita and Moss, 1973).</P><P><I>Soils</I>. <mark>Climate change</mark> will also have an impact on the soil, a vital element in agricultural ecosystems. Higher air temperatures will cause higher soil temperatures, which should generally increase solution chemical reaction rates and diffusion-controlled reactions (Buol et al., 1990). Solubilities of solid and gaseous components may either increase or decrease, but the consequences of these changes may take many years to become significant (Buol <I>et al</I>., 1990). Furthermore, higher temperatures will accelerate the decay of soil organic matter, resulting in release of <mark>CO2</mark> to the atmosphere and decrease in <mark>carbon</mark>/nitrogen ratios, although these two effects should be offset somewhat by the greater root biomass and crop residues resulting from plant responses to higher <mark>CO2</mark>.</P><P>
In temperate countries where crops are already heavily fertilized, there will probably be no major changes in fertilization practices, but alterations in timing and method (e.g., careful adjustment of side-dress applications of nitrogen during vegetative crop growth) are expected with changes in temperature and precipitation regimes (Buol <I>et al</I>., 1990). In tropical countries, where fertilization level is not always adequate, the need for fertilization will probably increase.</P><P>
Sea level rise, another predicted effect of global warming, will caused increased flooding, salt-water intrusion, and rising water tables in agricultural soils located near coastlines. This is particularly crucial in tropical countries such as Bangladesh, with large agricultural regions and high rural population located near current sea level.</P><P><I>Pests</I>. Pests are organisms that affect agricultural plants and animals in ways considered unfavorable. They include weeds, and certain insects, arthropods, nematodes, bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Because <mark>climate</mark> variables (especially temperature, wind and humidity) control the geographic distribution of pests, <mark>climate change</mark> is likely to alter their ranges. Insects may extend their ranges where warmer winter temperatures allow their over-wintering survival and increase the possible number of generations per season (Stinner, <I>et al</I>., 1989). Pests and diseases from low latitude regions, where they are much more prevalent (see <A href=""tab3.gif"">Table 3</A>) may be introduced at higher latitudes. As a consequence of pest increase, there may be a substantial rise in the use of agricultural chemicals in both temperate and tropical regions to control them.</P><P><B>SPECIFIC STUDIES IN TEMPERATE AND TROPICAL REGIONS</B></P><P>
Very few integrated regional studies have been completed on <mark>climate change</mark> impacts on agriculture. Parry <I>et al</I>. (1988a) report on integrated agricultural sector studies in high-latitude regions in Canada, Iceland, Finland, USSR, and Japan, concluding that warmer temperatures may aid crop production by lengthening the growing season, but that potential for higher evapotranspiration and drought conditions may be detrimental.</P><P>
Adams <I>et al</I>. (1990) conducted an integrated study for the US linking models from atmospheric science, plant science, and agricultural economics. While the outcomes depend on the severity of <mark>climate change</mark> and the compensating effects of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide on crop yields, the simulations suggest that irrigated acreage will expand and that regional patterns of US agriculture will shift with predicted global warming. With the more severe <mark>climate change</mark> scenario tested, the movement of US production into export markets is substantially reduced.</P><P>
The Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas (MINK) study integrated both within the agricultural sectors and across other sectors (Rosenberg and Crosson, 1990). The study incorporated both the physiological effects of <mark>CO2</mark> and adaptation by farmers to the climatic conditions of the 1930s. Even with the relatively mild warming (1.1deg.C) of the 1930s and with farmer adaptation and <mark>CO2</mark> physiological effects taken into account, regional production declined by 3.3%. Given the IPCC (1990a) estimate of 2.5deg.C warming for doubled <mark>CO2</mark> conditions, these results imply agricultural losses of about 10% for equilibrium warming of doubling of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide-equivalent (Cline, 1991).</P><P>
The second volume of Parry <I>et al</I>. (1988b) includes studies of the impact of <mark>climate change</mark>s on agriculture in Kenya, Brazil, Ecuador, India, and Australia. These case studies used the impacts of past climatic variations, rather than projections of future <mark>climate</mark>, to provide insights into the sensitivity of agriculture to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>
Liverman (1991) and Liverman and O'Brien (1991) have described how global warming may affect Mexican agriculture, using GCM output to project declines in moisture availability and maize yields at several sites in Mexico.</P><P>
A number of conferences and publications have recently raised concern about the possible impacts of global warming in tropical regions, but they have not included explicit analyses of how global warming may affect tropical agriculture (Fundacion Universo Veintinuo 1990; HARC 1991; Suliman 1990; Universidad de Sao Paulo 1990).</P><P><B>GLOBAL ESTIMATES OF AGRICULTURAL IMPACTS</B></P><P>
Global estimates of agricultural impacts have been fairly rough to date, because of lack of consistent methodology and uncertainty about the physiological effects of <mark>CO2</mark>. General studies of how <mark>climate change</mark> might affect agriculture include those of the National Defense University (1983), Liverman (1986), and Warrick (1988). Kane <I>et al</I>. (1989) broadly predicted improvements in agricultural production at high latitudes and reductions in northern hemisphere mid-<mark>continental ag</mark>ricultural regions. The IPCC (199Ob) concluded that while future food production should be maintained, negative impacts were likely in some regions, particularly where present-day vulnerability is high.</P><P>
An international project of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), &quot;Implications of <mark>Climate Change</mark> for International Agriculture: Global Food Trade and Vulnerable Regions,&quot; has been established to estimate the potential effects of greenhouse gas-induced <mark>climate change</mark> on global food trade, focusing on the distribution and quantity of production of the major food crops for a consistent set of <mark>climate change</mark> scenarios and <mark>CO2</mark> physiological effects. Other goals of the project are to determine how currently vulnerable, food-deficit regions may be affected by global <mark>climate change</mark>; to identify the future locations of those regions and the magnitudes of their food-deficits; and to study the effectiveness of adaptive responses, including the use of genetic resources, to global <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>
As part of the EPA project, crop specialists are estimating yield changes at over 100 sites in over 20 countries (see <A href=""fig1.gif"">Figure 1</A>), under common <mark>climate change</mark> scenarios using compatible crop growth models. The focus is on staple food crops: wheat, rice, maize, and soybeans. The crop models are those developed by the International Benchmark Sites Network for Agrotechnology Transfer (IBSNAT, 1990)---a global network of crop modelers funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development. The choice of the IBSNAT crop models was based on several criteria. First, the models simulate crop response to the major <mark>climate</mark> variables of temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation, and include the effects of soil characteristics on water availability for crop growth. Second, the models have been validated for a range of soil and <mark>climate</mark> conditions. Third, the models are developed with compatible data structures so that the same soil and <mark>climate</mark> data bases could be used with all crops.</P><P>
Preliminary national production changes for wheat based on IBSNAT crop model results are shown in <A href=""tab4.gif"">Table 4</A> (Rosenzweig and Iglesias, <I>et al</I>., 1992). Results from individual sites have been aggregated according to rainfed and irrigated practice and contribution to regional and national production. The table shows national production changes for the three <mark>climate change</mark> scenarios with (555 ppm) and without (330 ppm) the physiological effects of <mark>CO2</mark> on crop growth.</P><P>
In general, these results show that the <mark>climate change</mark> scenarios without the physiological effects of <mark>CO2</mark> cause decreases in estimated national production, while the physiological effects of <mark>CO2</mark> mitigate the negative effects. Production declines occur in many locations, however, even with the compensating <mark>CO2</mark> effects. Production changes tend to be less negative and even positive in some cases in countries in mid and high latitudes, while simulations in countries in the low latitudes indicate more detrimental effects of <mark>climate change</mark> on agricultural production. The UKMO <mark>climate change</mark> scenario (mean global warming of 5.2deg.C) generally causes the largest production declines, while the GFDL and GISS (4.0 and 4.2deg.C mean global warming, respectively) production changes are more moderate.</P><P>
When embedded in a global agricultural food trade model, the Basic Linked System (Fischer <I>et al</I>., 1988), the production change estimates based on IBSNAT crop model results will allow for projection of potential impacts on food prices, shifts in comparative advantage, and altered patterns of global trade flows for a suite of global <mark>climate change</mark>, population, growth, and policy scenarios.</P><P><B>ADAPTATION TO <mark>CLIMATE CHANGE</mark></B></P><P>
The importance of farm and state level adaptations to <mark>climate change</mark> and variability has been demonstrated in a number of studies (e.g. Rosenberg <I>et al</I> 1989; Waggoner 1983; White 1974) Adaptations to <mark>climate change</mark> exist at the various levels of agricultural organization. In temperate regions, farm-level adaptations include changes in planting and harvest dates, tillage and rotation practices, substitution of crop varieties or species more appropriate to the changing <mark>climate</mark> regime, increased fertilizer or pesticide applications, and improved irrigation and drainage systems. Governments can facilitate adaptation to <mark>climate change</mark> through water development projects, agricultural extension activities, incentives, subsidies, regulations, and provision of insurance.</P><P>
Similar adaptations could occur in tropical regions as shown in <A href=""tab5.gif"">Table 5</A>. In Mexico, preliminary results from the EPA International Agriculture project suggest that severe declines in maize yields under global warming could be mitigated if <mark>climate change</mark> is accompanied by increases in irrigation, fertilizer use and the use of drought resistant varieties. The major problem in the tropics, compared to most temperate most temperate regions, is the relative lack of resources, institutions, and infrastructure to promote such adaptations.</P><P><B>CONCLUSIONS</B></P><P>
In general, the tropical regions appear to be more vulnerable to <mark>climate change</mark> than the temperate regions for several reasons. On the biophysical side, temperate C3 crops are likely to be more responsive to increasing levels of <mark>CO2</mark>. Second, tropical crops are closer to their high temperature optima and experience high temperature stress, despite lower projected amounts of warming. Third, insects and diseases, already much more prevalent in warmer and more humid regions, may become even more widespread.</P><P>
Tropical regions may also be more vulnerable to <mark>climate change</mark> because of economic and social constraints. Greater economic and individual dependence on agriculture, widespread poverty, inadequate technologies, and lack of political power are likely to exacerbate the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> in tropical regions.</P><P>
In the light of possible global warming, plant breeders should probably place even more emphasis on development of heat- and drought-resistance crops. Research is needed to define the current limits to these resistances and the feasibility of manipulation through modern genetic techniques. Both crop architecture and physiology may be genetically altered to adapt to warmer environmental conditions. In some regions it may be appropriate to take a second look at traditional technologies and crops as ways of coping with <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>
At the regional level, those charged with planning for resource allocation, including land, water, and agriculture development should take <mark>climate change</mark> into account. In coastal areas, agricultural land may be flooded or salinized; in continental interiors and other locations, droughts may increase. These eventualities can be dealt with more easily if anticipated.</P><P>
As climatic factors change, a host of consequences will ripple through the agricultural system, as human decisions involving farm management, grain storage facilities, transportation infrastructure, regional markets, and trade patterns respond. For example, field-level changes in thermal regimes, water conditions, pest infestations, and most importantly, quantity and quality of yields, may lead to changes in farm management decisions based on altered risk assessments. Consequences of these management decisions could result in local and regional alterations in farming systems, land use, and food availability. Ultimately, impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on agriculture may reverberate throughout the international food economy and global society.</P><P>
At the national and international levels, the needs of regions and people vulnerable to the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> on their food supply should be addressed. In many cases, reducing vulnerability to current <mark>climate</mark> variability should also serve to mitigate the impacts of global warming.</P><P>
It is important to ask, &quot;What will or should agriculture be like in the next century?&quot; Even if the answer is unknown, the flexibility gained in attempting to imagine the agricultural future should be a useful tool for adaptation to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P><B>REFERENCES</B></P><P>

Some laboratory experiments suggest that elevated CO<SUB>2</SUB> levels can increase plant growth.  However, other factors, such as changing temperatures, ozone, and water and nutrient constraints, may counteract these potential increases in yield. For example, if temperature exceeds a crop's optimal level, if sufficient water and nutrients are not available, yield increases may be reduced or reversed. Elevated CO<SUB>2</SUB> has been associated with reduced protein and nitrogen content in alfalfa and soybean plants, resulting in a loss of quality.  Reduced grain and forage quality can reduce the ability of pasture and rangeland to support grazing livestock.<A href=""#ref1""><SUP><SPAN>[1]</SPAN></SUP></A></LI><LI>More extreme temperature and precipitation can prevent crops from growing. Extreme events, especially floods and droughts, can harm crops and reduce yields.

For example, the food transportation system in the United States frequently moves large volumes of grain by water. In the case of an extreme weather event affecting a waterway, there are few, if any, alternate pathways for transport.  High temperatures and a shortage of rain in the summer of 2012 led to one of the most severe summer droughts the nation has seen and posed serious impacts to the Mississippi River watershed, a major transcontinental shipping route for Midwestern agriculture. This drought resulted in significant food and economic losses due to reductions in barge traffic, the volume of goods carried, and the number of Americans employed by the tugboat industry. The 2012 drought was immediately followed by flooding throughout the Mississippi in the spring of 2013, which also resulted in disruptions of barge traffic and food transport.<SUP><A href=""#ref3"">[3]</A></SUP> Transportation changes such as these reduce the ability of farmers to export their grains to international markets, and can affect global food prices.</P><P>Impacts to the global food supply concern the United States because food shortages can cause humanitarian crises and national security concerns.  They also can increase domestic food prices. </P><P class=""pagetop""><A href=""#main-content"">Top of Page</A></P><H3>References</H3><P><SMALL>[1] USGCRP (2014). Hatfield, J., G.

The pursuit of this understanding has led to development of Earth system history, an interdisciplinary science that includes not only the contributions of Earth system scientists but also <A href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/paleontology"" class=""md-crosslink"">paleontologists</A> (who study the life of past geologic periods), paleoclimatologists (who study past <mark>climate</mark>s), paleoecologists (who study past <A href=""https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/environments"" class=""md-dictionary-link"" data-term=""environments"">environments</A> and ecosystems), paleoceanographers (who study the history of the oceans), and other scientists concerned with Earth history.

Students of Earth system history are not just concerned with documenting what has happened; they also view the past as a series of experiments in which solar radiation, ocean currents, continental configurations, atmospheric chemistry, and other important features have varied. These experiments provide opportunities to learn the relative influences of and interactions between various components of the Earth system. Studies of Earth system history also specify the full array of states the system has experienced in the past and those the system is capable of experiencing in the future.</P><P>Undoubtedly, people have always been aware of climatic variation at the relatively short timescales of seasons, years, and decades.  Biblical scripture and other early documents refer to <A href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/drought"" class=""md-crosslink"">droughts</A>, <A href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/flood"" class=""md-crosslink"">floods</A>, periods of severe cold, and other climatic events. Nevertheless, a full appreciation of the nature and magnitude of climatic change did not come about until the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a time when the widespread recognition of the deep antiquity of Earth occurred. Naturalists of this time, including Scottish geologist <A href=""https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sir-Charles-Lyell-Baronet"" class=""md-crosslink"">Charles Lyell</A>, Swiss-born naturalist and geologist <A href=""https://www.britannica.com/biography/Louis-Agassiz"" class=""md-crosslink"">Louis Agassiz</A>, English naturalist <A href=""https://www.britannica.com/place/Darwin-Northern-Territory"" class=""md-crosslink"">Charles Darwin</A>, American botanist <A href=""https://www.britannica.com/biography/Asa-Gray"" class=""md-crosslink"">Asa Gray</A>, and Welsh naturalist <A href=""https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alfred-Russel-Wallace"" class=""md-crosslink"">Alfred Russel Wallace</A>, came to recognize geologic and biogeographic evidence that made sense only in the light of past <mark>climate</mark>s radically different from those prevailing today.</P><P>Geologists and paleontologists in the 19th and early 20th centuries uncovered evidence of massive climatic changes taking place before the <A href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/Pleistocene-Epoch"" class=""md-crosslink"">Pleistocene</A>—that is, before some 2.6 million years ago.

Earth system history is no exception. High-quality instrumental records spanning the past century exist for most parts of the world, but the records become sparse in the 19th century, and few records predate the late 18th century. Other historical documents, including ship’s logs, diaries, court and church records, and tax rolls, can sometimes be used. Within strict geographic <A href=""https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/contexts"" class=""md-dictionary-link"" data-term=""contexts"">contexts</A>, these sources can provide information on <A href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/frost-meteorology"" class=""md-crosslink"">frosts</A>, droughts, floods, sea ice, the dates of <A href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/monsoon"" class=""md-crosslink"">monsoons</A>, and other climatic features—in some cases up to several hundred years ago.</P><P>Fortunately, climatic change also leaves a variety of signatures in the natural world. <mark>Climate</mark> influences the growth of trees and corals, the abundance and geographic distribution of plant and animal species, the chemistry of oceans and lakes, the accumulation of ice in cold regions, and the erosion and <A href=""https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deposition"" class=""md-dictionary-link"" data-term=""deposition"">deposition</A> of materials on Earth’s surface. Paleoclimatologists study the traces of these effects, devising clever and subtle ways to obtain information about past <mark>climate</mark>s. Most of the evidence of past climatic change is circumstantial, so <A href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/paleoclimatology"" class=""md-crosslink autoxref"">paleoclimatology</A> involves a great deal of investigative work. Wherever possible, paleoclimatologists try to use multiple lines of evidence to cross-check their conclusions. They are frequently confronted with conflicting evidence, but this, as in other sciences, usually leads to an <A href=""https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enhanced"" class=""md-dictionary-link"" data-term=""enhanced"">enhanced</A> understanding of the Earth system and its complex history. New sources of data, analytical tools, and instruments are becoming available, and the field is moving quickly. Revolutionary changes in the understanding of Earth’s <mark>climate</mark> history have occurred since the 1990s, and coming decades will bring many new insights and interpretations.</P><P>Ongoing climatic changes are being monitored by networks of sensors in space, on the land surface, and both on and below the surface of the world’s oceans. Climatic changes of the past 200–300 years, especially since the early 1900s, are documented by instrumental records and other archives. These written documents and records provide information about <mark>climate change</mark> in some locations for the past few hundred years. Some very rare records date back over 1,000 years. Researchers studying climatic changes predating the instrumental record rely increasingly on natural archives, which are biological or geologic processes that record some aspect of past <mark>climate</mark>.

(A <A href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/<mark>carbon</mark>-sink"" class=""md-crosslink""><mark>carbon</mark> sink</A> is any process that removes <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide from the atmosphere by the chemical conversion of CO<SUB>2</SUB> to organic or inorganic <mark>carbon</mark> compounds.) <mark>Carbon</mark>ic acid, formed from <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and water, is a reactant in dissolution of <A href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/silicate-mineral"" class=""md-crosslink"">silicates</A> and other minerals. Weathering rates are related to the mass, elevation, and exposure of bedrock. Tectonic uplift can increase all these factors and thus lead to increased weathering and <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide absorption. For example, the chemical weathering of the rising Tibetan Plateau may have played an important role in depleting the atmosphere of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide during a global cooling period in the late Cenozoic Era.

Three primary features of Earth’s orbit are affected, each in a cyclic, or regularly recurring, manner. First, the shape of Earth’s orbit around the Sun, varies from nearly circular to elliptical (eccentric), with periodicities of 100,000 and 413,000 years. Second, the tilt of Earth’s axis with respect to the Sun, which is primarily responsible for Earth’s seasonal <mark>climate</mark>s, varies between  22.1° and 24.5° from the plane of Earth’s rotation around the Sun. This variation occurs on a cycle of 41,000 years. In general, the greater the tilt, the greater the solar radiation received by hemispheres in summer and the less received in <A href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/winter"" class=""md-crosslink autoxref"">winter</A>. The third cyclic change to Earth’s orbital geometry results from two combined phenomena: (1) Earth’s axis of rotation wobbles, changing the direction of the axis with respect to the Sun, and (2) the orientation of Earth’s orbital ellipse rotates slowly. These two processes create a 26,000-year cycle, called <A href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/precession-of-the-equinoxes"" class=""md-crosslink"">precession of the equinoxes</A>, in which the position of Earth at the equinoxes and solstices changes. Today Earth is closest to the Sun (perihelion) near the December solstice, whereas 9,000 years ago perihelion occurred near the June solstice.</P><P>These orbital variations cause changes in the latitudinal and seasonal distribution of solar radiation, which in turn drive a number of <mark>climate</mark> variations. Orbital variations play major roles in pacing glacial-interglacial and monsoonal patterns. Their influences have been identified in climatic changes over much of the Phanerozoic. For example, cyclothems—which are interbedded marine, fluvial, and coal beds characteristic of the <A href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/Pennsylvanian-Subperiod"" class=""md-crosslink"">Pennsylvanian Subperiod</A> (318.1 million to 299 million years ago)—appear to represent Milankovitch-driven changes in mean <A href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/sea-level"" class=""md-crosslink autoxref"">sea level</A>.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=""ref275772"" data-level=""2""><H2 class=""h2""><A href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/greenhouse-gas"" class=""md-crosslink"">Greenhouse gases</A></H2><P>Greenhouse gases are gas molecules that have the property of absorbing <A href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/infrared-radiation"" class=""md-crosslink"">infrared radiation</A> (net heat energy) emitted from Earth’s surface and reradiating it back to Earth’s surface, thus contributing to the phenomenon known as the <A href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/greenhouse-effect"" class=""md-crosslink"">greenhouse effect</A>. <mark>Carbon</mark> dioxide, <A href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/methane"" class=""md-crosslink"">methane</A>, and water vapour are the most important greenhouse gases, and they have a profound effect on the energy budget of the Earth system despite making up only a fraction of all atmospheric gases.

In general, greenhouse gas concentrations have been particularly high during warm periods and low during cold phases. A number of processes influence greenhouse gas concentrations. Some, such as tectonic activities, operate at timescales of millions of years, whereas others, such as vegetation, soil, wetland, and ocean sources and sinks, operate at timescales of hundreds to thousands of years.

The feedbacks involve different components that operate at different rates and timescales. Ice sheets, sea ice, terrestrial vegetation, ocean temperatures, weathering rates, ocean circulation, and greenhouse gas concentrations are all influenced either directly or indirectly by the atmosphere; however, they also all feed back into the atmosphere, thereby influencing it in important ways. For example, different forms and densities of vegetation on the land surface influence the <A href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/albedo"" class=""md-crosslink"">albedo</A>, or reflectivity, of Earth’s surface, thus affecting the overall radiation budget at local to regional scales. At the same time, the transfer of water molecules from soil to the atmosphere is mediated by vegetation, both directly (from <A href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/transpiration"" class=""md-crosslink"">transpiration</A> through plant <A href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/stomate"" class=""md-crosslink"">stomata</A>) and indirectly (from shading and temperature influences on direct <A href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/vaporization"" class=""md-crosslink"">evaporation</A> from soil). This regulation of latent heat flux by vegetation can influence <mark>climate</mark> at local to global scales. As a result, changes in vegetation, which are partially controlled by <mark>climate</mark>, can in turn influence the <mark>climate</mark> system. Vegetation also influences greenhouse gas concentrations; living plants <A href=""https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constitute"" class=""md-dictionary-link"" data-term=""constitute"">constitute</A> an important sink for atmospheric <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, whereas they act as sources of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide when they are burned by wildfires or undergo decomposition.

  Dutch vision on global <mark>climate</mark> action</H1><DIV class=""intro""><P>Dutch <mark>climate policy</mark> is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</P></DIV><H2>International action on <mark>climate change</mark></H2><P>The best way to fight the greenhouse effect is for countries to work together to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The Netherlands is party to a number of international <mark>climate</mark> agreements, including the United Nations (UN) convention on <mark>climate change</mark> and the Kyoto Protocol. These agreements form the basis of Dutch policy on <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><H2>UN <mark>climate</mark> agreement</H2><P>In December 2015 <A href=""/topics/<mark>climate</mark>-change/news/2015/12/14/the-netherlands-commits-to-historic-<mark>climate</mark>-change-agreement"">the UN held a <mark>climate</mark> summit in Paris: the Conference of Parties</A> (COP21). The Netherlands was one of the countries to sign up to a new UN <mark>climate</mark> agreement. The aim of the agreement is to limit global warming to  below 2 degrees Celsius, if possible no more than 1.5 degrees. On 22 April 2016 the Dutch environment minister signed the <mark>climate</mark> agreement on behalf of the 28 member states of the European Union. The agreement will take effect in 2020.</P><H2>Dutch <mark>climate policy</mark> is based on international research</H2><P>The Netherlands bases its <mark>climate policy</mark> on, among other things, scientific reports by the <A href=""http://ipcc.ch/"">Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark></A> (IPCC). The IPCC writes reports for the UN about the causes and effects of <mark>climate change</mark>. The reports also describe what measures are needed to halt global warming and what risks the future holds.</P><H2>Causes of <mark>climate change</mark></H2><P>Human activities are the main cause of the greenhouse effect, which is speeding up <mark>climate change</mark>. The Earth’s temperature is rising because people are burning more fossil fuels, cutting down more forests, and using more land for crops and livestock farming.</P><P>Historically, there are also a number of natural causes behind the rise in temperature: continental drift, ocean currents, the impact of comets and meteorites, and volcanic eruptions.</P><H2>Government takes action to deal with the impact of <mark>climate change</mark></H2><P>To minimise the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, the government needs to take action.</P><P>Dutch <mark>climate policy</mark> focuses on:</P><UL><LI>Adapting to <mark>climate change</mark>. For instance, by taking measures to prevent flooding and protect freshwater supplies, agricultural production, the environment and health. The reinforcement of dikes also falls under adaptation. And cities, for example, can plant more trees and other vegetation to manage heat stress.</LI><LI>Reducing greenhouse gas emissions so the <mark>climate</mark> does not change so rapidly and radically. This can be done by switching from fossil fuels to <mark>sustainable</mark> energy sources, like solar and wind power.</LI></UL><H2>Reducing greenhouse gas emissions</H2><P>Greenhouse gases that are in the air have already warmed the <mark>climate</mark>. To keep the <mark>climate</mark> from changing even more, we need to lower the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted. The main greenhouse gas is <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, or <mark>CO2</mark> (56%), followed by methane (32%) and nitrous oxide (6%). These gases enter the atmosphere when oil, gas and coal are burned – for instance, in industry and transport – and through intensive livestock farming.</P><P>By 2020 the amount of greenhouse gases coming into the atmosphere must be 20% lower than in 1990.</P><H2>The <mark>Climate</mark> Agenda</H2><P>The <mark>Climate</mark> Agenda outlines the government’s plans for dealing with <mark>climate change</mark>. It also sets out a number of national and international goals that the Netherlands is looking to achieve, together with various partners, both Dutch and international. These partners include the private sector, civil society organisations and other governments.</P><H2>Agreements on emissions by municipalities, water authorities and provinces</H2><P>More than half of all <mark>CO2</mark> emissions originate in and around cities. That's why local authorities (municipalities, provinces and water authorities) have the freedom to pursue their own <mark>climate</mark> policies. Central government supports this.</P><P>This is why it drew up the Local <mark>Climate</mark> Agenda 2011-2014, together with local and regional authorities. The agenda contains examples of measures that work well on a large scale. For example:</P><UL><LI>making existing homes and other buildings more energy-efficient</LI><LI>promoting energy-efficient forms of transportation (like bicycles and public transport)</LI><LI>ensuring that there are enough charging points for electric vehicles. <A href=""http://rwsenvironment.eu/subjects/local-<mark>climate</mark>-policy/"" class=""external"" aria-label=""This webpage (opens external website)"">This webpage</A> by Rijkswaterstaat contains more information about local policy on energy and the <mark>climate</mark>.</LI></UL><H2>Better technology can reduce greenhouse gases</H2><P>We can use technology to lower greenhouse gases. For example, we can develop solutions for:</P><UL><LI>saving energy;</LI><LI>saving and reusing raw materials;</LI><LI>cleaner cars;</LI><LI>cleaner crop and livestock management methods;</LI><LI>more energy-efficient devices and appliances.</LI></UL><P>Global demand is on the rise for these types of solutions. The Netherlands aims to be a world leader in smart, clean and energy-efficient technologies. Central government supports the development and marketing of new technologies, for example through <A href=""http://www.greendeals.nl/english/green-deal-approach/"" class=""external"" aria-label=""Green Deals (opens external website)"">Green Deals</A>.</P><H2>The role of the private sector</H2><P>Over 200 companies and civil society organisations are working together in the Dutch <A href=""/topics/<mark>climate</mark>-change/news/2014/11/24/dutch-coalition-against-<mark>climate</mark>-change-off-to-a-good-start""><mark>Climate</mark> Coalition</A>. They are taking far-reaching <mark>climate</mark> measures to make their business operations <mark>climate</mark>-neutral. In doing so, they are also complying with international <mark>climate</mark> agreements.</P><P>Various parties are also exploring <mark>climate</mark>-smart <mark>innovation</mark>, new ways of doing business and smart partnerships. The <mark>Climate</mark> Coalition is supported by central government.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Efforts to develop adaptation strategies for agricultural water management can benefit from understanding the risks and adaptation strategies proposed to date. This understanding may assist in developing priorities for the adaptation of water resources for irrigation. Here we characterise the main risks across European regions and evaluate adaptation strategies by reviewing over 168 highly relevant publications that appeared in the last 15 years. Based on this extensive database we characterise the effort and benefit of a number of agronomic and policy measures, aiming to develop concrete adaptation plans and responding to concrete regional challenges. The adaptation choices consider current technological perspectives and do not project future technological change; we are certain that technological change will shape some choices for adaptation in the coming decades. The greatest scope for action is in improving adaptive capacity and responding to changes in water demands, however the implementation requires revamping current water policy, adequate training to farmers and viable financial instruments. These results aim to assist stakeholders as they take up the adaptation challenge and develop measures to reduce the vulnerability of the sector to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""abstract graphical"" id=""abs0005""><H2 class=""section-title"">Graphical abstract</H2></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

These can be complementary, and it is therefore an important challenge to link their best practices. African policy-makers generally promote <mark>climate</mark>-smart agriculture (CSA) and aim to mainstream this approach in agricultural policies and interventions at continental, regional and national levels. But a lack of knowledge, weak governance and insufficient finance impede smooth mainstreaming.</P><P>Moreover, despite mainstreaming efforts, “<mark>climate</mark>” and “agriculture” are treated in silos. There is also a disconnect between policies and frameworks at the global, continental, regional, national and local levels. A multistakeholder, bottom-up, intersectorial approach can overcome these challenges. At the same time, top-down frameworks such as the UN <mark>climate</mark> debates should give “agriculture” its deserved priority, given its relevance as “victim and vector” of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Investing in <mark>climate</mark>-sensitive agriculture is an opportunity for the private sector to make <mark>sustainable</mark> profits. But governments and financial partners should create an enabling environment and provide financial incentives to mitigate risks especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). SMEs can better address opportunities in local markets and can better adapt <mark>climate</mark> smart technologies to local markets.</P><H2>Infographic</H2><P><B>To see the full infographic, click on the preview below.</B></P><H2>Read Briefing Note 80</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ASIDE><P>However, there is a risk that these technologies blind us to the very real problems facing modern agriculture – problems that are rapidly undermining the previous round of technological advances.</P><P>While global crop yields rose rapidly in the early decades of the “green revolution”, productivity is now plateauing in many regions of the world. A <A href=""http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2296"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">2012 meta-study</A> found that in 24%-39% of areas growing maize, rice, wheat and soybean, yields either failed to improve, stagnated after initial gains, or collapsed.</P><P>Only slightly more than half of all global rice and wheat areas (57% and 56% respectively) are still experiencing yield increases. The areas where yields have stagnated include some of the wealthiest, most industrialised and most hi-tech production systems: more than one-third of the wheat crop in the US (mostly in the Great Plains) is affected, along with more than a third of the Argentine wheat crop, and harvests all across Europe.</P><P>Meanwhile, rice yields are plateauing in California and most European rice-growing areas. This trend is also evident in some 80% of rice crops in China and Indonesia – two of the world’s major rice producers. Worryingly, this may only be the tip of the iceberg. </P><P>The reason the productivity of industrial agriculture is now under threat is because it has been systematically degrading the human and natural capital on which it relies. Pests, viruses, fungi, bacteria and weeds are adapting to chemical pest management faster than ever: <A href=""http://www.springer.com/la/book/9789400777958"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">210 species of herbicide-resistant weeds</A> have been <A href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286056270_Herbicide_Resistant_Weeds"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">identified</A>. Meanwhile, synthetic fertilisers are fast destroying the soil biota and its nutrient-recycling potential. This creates a dangerous treadmill effect: increasing resistance leads to increasing pesticide use, generating mounting costs for farmers and further environmental degradation. This in turn requires additional doses of nutrient application to keep squeezing productivity out of the soils.</P><P>Meanwhile, food systems are responsible for up to <A href=""http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-environ-020411-130608"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">29% of global greenhouse gas emissions</A> – and are therefore driving the <mark>climate</mark> instability that is itself the greatest threat to future agricultural productivity. A major chunk of these emissions come from large-scale monocultures and industrial animal feedlots in the global north, and from the loss of <mark>carbon</mark> sinks in the global south as land is cleared – often to make way for maize and soybean monocultures to export as animal feed.</P><P>Recent crop-breeding <mark>innovation</mark>s may be impressive, but they do not hold answers to the most pressing question: namely, how to move away from industrial monocultures and the inevitable damage and vulnerability they bring. One <A href=""http://phys.org/news/2016-12-bowl-devastate-today-crops.html"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">new study</A> suggests that a repeat of the Dust Bowl conditions of the 1930s – increasingly likely in a context of <mark>climate change</mark> – would wipe out 40% of US maize and soy crops, and 30% of wheat. What matters most is resilience. And resilience cannot be delivered without rethinking the fundamental principles of our food and farming systems.</P><P>The risk is that new technologies simply give industrial agriculture a new lease of life and delay the inevitable shift to a fundamentally different model of agriculture.</P><P>A viable alternative exists in the shape of diversified agro-ecological systems. In other words, diversifying farms and farming landscapes – replacing synthetic chemical inputs, optimising biodiversity and stimulating interactions between different species, as part of holistic and regenerative strategies to build long-term soil fertility, healthy agro-ecosystems and secure livelihoods.</P><ASIDE class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded"" data-component=""rich-link"" data-link-name=""rich-link-2 | 2""><DIV class=""rich-link""><DIV class=""rich-link__container""><DIV class=""rich-link__header""><H1 class=""rich-link__title"">Southern Africa cries for help as El Niño and <mark>climate change</mark> savage maize harvest</H1></DIV><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more""><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more-text"">

</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ASIDE><P>Too often, these arguments are dismissed as technophobia. We are told that the opponents of industrial agriculture want to eschew technological advance and keep developing regions mired in non-mechanised, subsistence-style agriculture. However, this is a false dichotomy. </P><P>A transition to diversified agro-ecological systems is needed, whether the starting point is industrial agriculture or subsistence-style farming. Moreover, the agro-ecological alternative is hi-tech and knowledge intensive– it requires complex synergies to be built and sustained between different crop varieties and species, and between different farming systems (mixed crop-livestock systems, for instance).</P><P>The growing body of evidence <A href=""http://www.ipes-food.org/images/Reports/UniformityToDiversity_FullReport.pdf"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">reviewed by the International Panel of Experts on <mark>Sustainable</mark> Food Systems</A> (iPES-Food) shows the huge potential of these systems to succeed where industrial systems are failing – namely in reconciling concerns such as food security, environmental and livelihood resilience, nutritional adequacy and social equity.</P><P>Crucially, where diversified systems raise productivity and improve livelihoods, they do so durably, performing particularly well under environmental stress and delivering production increases in the places where additional food is desperately needed. For example, the agro-ecological <A href=""http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">system of rise intensification</A> approach is securing and increasing rice yields around the world, while “<A href=""http://push-pull.net"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">push-pull” systems</A> – controlling pests by pushing them away with repellent plants or pulling them towards decoy crops – are doubling and trebling maize production in Africa.</P><P>The social change that so often accompanies this shift paves the way for revaluing local farming within new and often shorter supply chains, providing vulnerable populations with a viable alternative to the high and volatile production costs of industrial commodity agriculture and the uncertainties of global markets.</P><P>The picture is far from complete. To date these systems have seen only minimal investment and support. Either way, the burden of proof is on the proponents of industrial agriculture to show how it can ever be productive and <mark>sustainable</mark>, with or without miracle breakthroughs. In the meantime, a less dazzling but highly compelling agro-ecological alternative is taking shape and transforming food systems around the world. It deserves our urgent attention.</P><P><SPAN class=""bullet"">•</SPAN><EM>Olivier De Schutter is the former UN special rapporteur on the right to food, and co-chair of </EM><EM>iPES-Food</EM><EM>. </EM><EM>Emile Frison is the former director general of Bioversity International and the lead author of the </EM><EM>first major <A href=""http://www.ipes-food.org/images/Reports/UniformityToDiversity_FullReport.pdf"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">report</A> from </EM><EM>iPES-Food</EM></P><DIV class=""submeta""><SPAN class=""submeta__label"">Topics</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The energy changes spread out around the globe upsetting <mark>climate</mark> processes. There are many causes for these energy shifts, called <mark>climate</mark> forcers; some internal in the <mark>climate</mark> itself, some natural but external to <mark>climate</mark>, and some man-made.</P>According to Wikipedia,<P><EM>“<mark>Climate</mark> is the long-term pattern of weather in a particular area. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. <mark>Climate</mark> is different from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.”</EM></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>One of the big questions in the <mark>climate change</mark> debate: Are humans any smarter than frogs in a pot? If you put a frog in a pot and slowly turn up the heat, it won’t jump out. Instead, it will enjoy the nice warm bath until it is cooked to death. We humans seem to be doing pretty much the same thing.

Changes in the sun’s intensity (solar irradiance) have influenced energy shifts for centuries, however, solar energy has not changed enough recently to account for the global warming we’re now experiencing. In fact, measurements have shown a slight decrease in intensity in the past few decades.</P><OL start=""2""><LI><STRONG>Orbital Shifts</STRONG></LI></OL><P>As the Earth orbits around the sun, slight variations in its orbit occur, much as the globe model in geography class wobbles on its axis. This changes how much of the sun’s energy reaches the Earth. These variations are considered too long-term, however, and, while they do affect the Earth’s energy input, do not really have a noticeable effect on the huge <mark>climate change</mark>s that have occurred during human’s existence.</P><OL start=""3""><LI><STRONG>Volcanic Activity</STRONG></LI></OL><P>Volcanic eruptions affect how much energy can enter the Earth due to the aerosol particles that are expelled into the atmosphere. This only happens episodically, however, and has short-term effects on the <mark>climate</mark>. Moreover, while <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide is released into the air, its amounts are minimal and the aerosols released into the air actually serve to cool the Earth down by blocking sunlight. The lava expelled by eruption volcanoes does not contribute to global warming either, as it only covers a small area. Thus, while volcanic eruptions are always included in <mark>climate</mark> forcer lists, its contribution is actually up for debate.</P><OL start=""4""><LI><STRONG>Continental Drift</STRONG></LI></OL><P>All the separate continents gradually drifted apart over a span of 250 million years, and they are still drifting today. This shifting of large landmasses changed ocean current flow and winds and altered the atmosphere. As in the case of other natural causes of <mark>climate change</mark> mentioned here, however, the effects of continental drift is considered to be too small to be a real contributor.</P><P><STRONG>Internal <mark>Climate</mark> Causes</STRONG></P><OL><LI><STRONG>Seasonal Changes</STRONG></LI></OL><P>Seasonal changes occur naturally and they themselves encourage <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide release. Warmer oceans or autumnal leaf fall are two such seasonal changes that impact energy input.</P><OL start=""2""><LI><STRONG>El Nino-La Nina</STRONG></LI></OL><P>Around every 4 years, El Nino starts over the Pacific Ocean when the trade winds blowing over it from East to West weaken. Warm surface water that is normally pushed westward slows down. The water surface of the eastern Pacific heats up while the water surface of the western Pacific cools down.</P><P>Converse conditions known as La Nina sometimes follows El Nino during which the surface waters of the eastern Pacific cool down instead. Both these conditions affect circulation patterns in the atmosphere and, ultimately, influence the <mark>climate</mark>. El Nino raises global temperatures whereas La Nina decreases it.</P><OL start=""3""><LI><STRONG>Arctic Oscillation</STRONG></LI></OL><P>Changing air pressure patterns in the northern hemisphere causes arctic oscillation. Normally the atmospheric pressure in the polar regions are opposite to one another. The first stage of Arctic oscillation causes this pressure difference to widen even more, which raises temperatures in parts of Europe and North America and lowers temperatures in the Arctic. The second stage of the oscillation brings about the opposite effect. Arctic oscillation influences regional weather more than global temperature.</P><H2><STRONG>Man-made Causes of <mark>Climate Change</mark></STRONG></H2><P>We are accelerating the rate of <mark>climate change</mark> far past what the influence of the sun or any natural forcer could achieve. Processes in our daily lives are expelling chemicals and foreign substances into the air that affect and increase the natural greenhouse gases, which then absorb more energy from the sun. This results in global warming and changes the <mark>climate</mark>.</P><OL><LI><STRONG>Greenhouse Gas Emission</STRONG></LI></OL><P>Greenhouse gas emission is said to be the largest man-made <mark>climate</mark> forcer as it is so prevalent and large-scale. Greenhouse gases occur naturally in the atmosphere and they serve to absorb and radiate the Sun’s heat around the globe for the benefit of life. Humans are now producing large amounts of these gasses on such a level that it has upset energy balance.</P><P>Some of these greenhouse gases are long-lived like <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and nitrous oxide, so the damage they cause is obvious. However, short-lived substances like methane still affect the energy balance as they are very potent and there are so many of them. Moreover, human activity continues to release them into the atmosphere.</P><OL start=""2""><LI><STRONG>Fossil Fuel Usage</STRONG></LI></OL><P>Fossil fuel burning produces, among other chemicals, <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide that is the primary greenhouse gas forcer of <mark>climate change</mark>. In itself it is not a particularly warming gas, but the amount that we are emitting into the atmosphere makes it the most damaging. It also has a long life in the atmosphere, only fully dissipating after 50,000 years during which time it continues to absorb and radiate heat.</P><OL start=""3""><LI><STRONG>Black <mark>Carbon</mark></STRONG></LI></OL><P>Another by-product of fossil fuels is black <mark>carbon</mark>, which is produced when fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass are not properly combusted and emit soot. It enters the atmosphere as fine particles (aerosols) and absorbs large amounts of heat and infrared radiation. The majority of black <mark>carbon</mark> in the U.S. is emitted from vehicles, especially diesel-fuelled ones. Wildfires and industrial and residential heating are also black <mark>carbon</mark> emitters.</P><P>Black <mark>carbon</mark> is drifted across the globe on winds, and can be deposited on snow or ice. This darkens snow or ice, thus increasing its ability to absorb heat. This, in turn, forces the ice to melt faster.</P><OL start=""4""><LI><STRONG>Industrial Production &amp; Farming</STRONG></LI></OL><P>Emissions from factories contribute directly to the greenhouse effect while runoff waste alters the chemical make-up of water and air. Chemical pesticides, herbicides and fungicides used in industrial farming also wreak havoc to the atmosphere. Livestock farming also releases large amounts of methane into the air, driving up the amount of greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere.</P><OL start=""5""><LI><STRONG>Agriculture</STRONG></LI></OL><P>Agriculture accounts for 14% of total greenhouse gas emissions, and with the need for more agriculture to provide for our ever-growing needs, its impact is growing rapidly. The main agricultural contributors to <mark>climate</mark> forcers include <mark>carbon</mark> released from farmland soil by inappropriate farming and grazing practices.</P><P>Changes in land use for agriculture is also a large contributor to <mark>climate change</mark>. <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillage"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Tillage</A> and water rerouting has accelerated soil erosion, soil organic matter has been lost due to chemicals, and soil itself has been altered and polluted by chemical fertilizers, all of which affect the atmosphere with various emissions.</P><OL start=""6""><LI><STRONG>Deforestation</STRONG></LI></OL><P>Vast swatches of primary forests are being wiped out to make way for un<mark>sustainable</mark> farming, urbanization or for logging and the production of paper goods. Trees absorb <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide from the atmosphere, so as more trees are cut down, the level of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the air will increase. In short, deforestation affects <mark>climate</mark> in a big way.</P><OL start=""7""><LI><STRONG>Urbanization</STRONG></LI></OL><P>As our populations increase and our cities reach maximum capacity, we start to expand them in what is called urban sprawl. This decreases the amount of vegetation available to absorb <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide. In turn, urbanization means more greenhouse gas, <mark>pollution</mark> and waste output.</P><P>Other damaging side effects of urbanization include the Heat Island Effect: air and surface temperatures are driven higher above urban areas than above rural areas due to concentrated usage of fossil fuels, electricity etc. As urban areas grow, so will the number of heat islands, which will drive up the overall atmospheric temperature. A side effect of this side effect is that water vapor above urban areas will also be driven up, causing more clouds and rain.</P><OL start=""8""><LI><STRONG>Sulfates, Organic <mark>Carbon</mark>s &amp; Aerosols (small particles)</STRONG></LI></OL><P>These are actually negative forcers, but warming and cooling aerosols can change some of the processes of clouds. As negative forcers, clouds reflect sunlight back up. As positive forcers, they trap outgoing heat.</P><P>One cause of <mark>climate change</mark> that is up for debate as to whether it is natural or man-made is our very own respiration. Every breath we take releases <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide into the atmosphere. Whatever it is, we all impact <mark>climate change</mark>, so we should all make the effort to slow it down too.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

According to the UNCCD (United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification), nearly 20 million acres of arable land is lost each year due to desertification and the primary reasons are:</P><P>1. deforestation due to cultivation of crops and pasture</P><P>2. overgrazing from livestock (“eating away grasses and eroding topsoil with hooves”)</P><P>3. intensive farming stripping away nutrients in soil</P><P><A href=""http://www.un.org/en/events/desertificationday/background.shtml"">http://www.un.org/en/events/desertificationday/background.shtml</A></P><P>Overgrazing by livestock is the principal land problem related to desertification as indicated in the article: <A href=""http://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/docs/002-186/002-186.html"">http://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/docs/002-186/002-186.html</A> And, according to the UNDDD: “Nearly 20% of the degrading land (globally) is cropland, and 20-25%, rangeland.” Understanding that over 70% of the global arable land used for agriculture is planted for crops grown for livestock, there is be ample support for the statement that “animal agriculture is the leading driver for approximately 1/3 of the land lost on earth due to desertification.” <A href=""http://www.un.org/en/events/desertification_decade/whynow.shtml"">http://www.un.org/en/events/desertification_decade/whynow.shtml</A></P><P> </P><P>[xix]   Few prominent scientists will openly proclaim the connection of their research findings with the need to eliminate animal agriculture or promotion of fully plant based nutrition. This is an observation that spans all aspects of global depletion related to food choice, including the topic of loss of biodiversity and extinction of species. </P><P>The statement that animal agriculture is the primary driver of biodiversity loss and extinction of species is supported by many discussions and interviews with leading authors and scientists working for the Convention of Biodiversity and IUCN as well as publications regarding current biodiversity assessments as presented by Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, the IUCN Red List, and the Global Environmental and Biodiversity Outlook.</P><P>Most organizations that associate their work with species and ecosystem/biodiversity concerns as well as the scientific community as a whole believe that the six main threats to our oceans are <mark>climate change</mark>, overfishing, predator loss, <mark>pollution</mark>, destruction of habitat, and bycatch, (“bykill”).</P><P>(For instance: The Species Survival Commission of the World Conservation Union and the Convention on Biological Diversity).</P><P>As of August 2012, the 2004 Global Species Assessment was the most recent empirical data on global extinction rates, based on birds, mammals, and amphibians. According to an interview conducted by Dr. Oppenlander with Simon Stuart, PhD, chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Species Survival Commission:</P><P>“Habitat loss from grazing livestock and feed crops is far and away the most pervasive threat to terrestrial animal species, impacting 86 percent of all mammals, 88 percent of amphibians, and 86 percent of all birds. One in every eight birds, one in every three amphibians, and one in every four mammals is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the near future. Overexploitation of wild animals for consumption remains a second major factor for extinction, such as can be seen in bushmeat trade in Africa and Southeast Asia and all hunting endeavors on land, globally.” </P><P>The Alliance for Global Conservation estimates 36 percent of all species on our planet are in danger of extinction.</P><P>Scientists have divided our planet into 825 terrestrial “ecoregions” (as well as 450 freshwater and a number of oceanic ecoregions), each defined by its own distinct set of animal and plant species, as well as <mark>climate</mark>. Of all these land ecoregions, almost half are reported by lead scientists (interviews/discussions) to have livestock as a current threat. The World Conservation Union reported in 2010 that “most of the world’s endangered or threatened species” on their Red List (which lists the species that are most endangered) are suffering habitat loss due to livestock—not due to agriculture but to livestock.</P><P>The Convention on Biological Diversity, held in Nagoya, Japan, in October 2010 agreed that none of their goals from 2002 for lessening the rate of biodiversity loss were met. The attendees confirmed that the main pressures for the rapid loss of species—habitat change, overexploitation, <mark>pollution</mark>, invasive species, and <mark>climate change</mark>—were all increasing in intensity.</P><P>Current biodiversity assessments (as presented by Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, the IUCN Red List, and the Global Environmental and Biodiversity Outlook) now generally agree that land use change, modification of river flow, freshwater <mark>pollution</mark>, and exploitation of marine environments are the most significant drivers of biodiversity change and loss of species. Because more than 50% of the land use changes on Earth are related to livestock (ILRI), 70 to 90% of freshwater <mark>pollution</mark> in western countries (particularly the U.S. and China) can be traced back to animal agriculture, minimally 14.5% of anthropogenic GHG emissions/<mark>climate change</mark>, and 100% of “exploitation of marine environments” is related to the global commercial fishing industry, it can be safely and confidently demonstrated that “the primary driver of global species’ extinctions and loss of biodiversity is animal agriculture.” </P><P> </P><P>[xx] The amount of water, land and fuel used for differing diets varies greatly from the types of foods consumed, amount consumed and the geographical region where the food was raised. Taking into consideration that 1lb of beef requires upwards of 2500 gallons of water to produce compared to only 25 gallons for 1lb of wheat, the water footprint of a person consuming a high meat diet could be 100x greater than that of a person consuming only plant foods. The same applies for land and oil use. Many arid areas of the world can not support 1 cow per 2 acres and require 50+ acre per cow, compared to a crops such as potatoes that can produce 50,000lbs+ per acre. The energy/fuel inputs are similar. 1 calorie of beef can take 27x more energy to produce than soybeans. </P><P>xxi (New) As of 2016 the estimates of wild horses and burros has increased on the range to 67,027 and the amount of wild horses and burros in holding fcailities is more than 45,000. However the BLM considers the amount of wild horses and burros on the range too populated and will attempt to remove 40,000 to bring the level back to what is considered by the BLM the 'acceptable level'</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html"" data-block-type=""2"" id=""block-yui_3_17_2_15_1414543521348_68760""><DIV class=""sqs-block-content""><P style=""text-align:center""> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ASIDE><P>However, there is a risk that these technologies blind us to the very real problems facing modern agriculture – problems that are rapidly undermining the previous round of technological advances.</P><P>While global crop yields rose rapidly in the early decades of the “green revolution”, productivity is now plateauing in many regions of the world. A <A href=""http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2296"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">2012 meta-study</A> found that in 24%-39% of areas growing maize, rice, wheat and soybean, yields either failed to improve, stagnated after initial gains, or collapsed.</P><P>Only slightly more than half of all global rice and wheat areas (57% and 56% respectively) are still experiencing yield increases. The areas where yields have stagnated include some of the wealthiest, most industrialised and most hi-tech production systems: more than one-third of the wheat crop in the US (mostly in the Great Plains) is affected, along with more than a third of the Argentine wheat crop, and harvests all across Europe.</P><P>Meanwhile, rice yields are plateauing in California and most European rice-growing areas. This trend is also evident in some 80% of rice crops in China and Indonesia – two of the world’s major rice producers. Worryingly, this may only be the tip of the iceberg. </P><P>The reason the productivity of industrial agriculture is now under threat is because it has been systematically degrading the human and natural capital on which it relies. Pests, viruses, fungi, bacteria and weeds are adapting to chemical pest management faster than ever: <A href=""http://www.springer.com/la/book/9789400777958"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">210 species of herbicide-resistant weeds</A> have been <A href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286056270_Herbicide_Resistant_Weeds"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">identified</A>. Meanwhile, synthetic fertilisers are fast destroying the soil biota and its nutrient-recycling potential. This creates a dangerous treadmill effect: increasing resistance leads to increasing pesticide use, generating mounting costs for farmers and further environmental degradation. This in turn requires additional doses of nutrient application to keep squeezing productivity out of the soils.</P><P>Meanwhile, food systems are responsible for up to <A href=""http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-environ-020411-130608"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">29% of global greenhouse gas emissions</A> – and are therefore driving the <mark>climate</mark> instability that is itself the greatest threat to future agricultural productivity. A major chunk of these emissions come from large-scale monocultures and industrial animal feedlots in the global north, and from the loss of <mark>carbon</mark> sinks in the global south as land is cleared – often to make way for maize and soybean monocultures to export as animal feed.</P><P>Recent crop-breeding <mark>innovation</mark>s may be impressive, but they do not hold answers to the most pressing question: namely, how to move away from industrial monocultures and the inevitable damage and vulnerability they bring. One <A href=""http://phys.org/news/2016-12-bowl-devastate-today-crops.html"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">new study</A> suggests that a repeat of the Dust Bowl conditions of the 1930s – increasingly likely in a context of <mark>climate change</mark> – would wipe out 40% of US maize and soy crops, and 30% of wheat. What matters most is resilience. And resilience cannot be delivered without rethinking the fundamental principles of our food and farming systems.</P><P>The risk is that new technologies simply give industrial agriculture a new lease of life and delay the inevitable shift to a fundamentally different model of agriculture.</P><P>A viable alternative exists in the shape of diversified agro-ecological systems. In other words, diversifying farms and farming landscapes – replacing synthetic chemical inputs, optimising biodiversity and stimulating interactions between different species, as part of holistic and regenerative strategies to build long-term soil fertility, healthy agro-ecosystems and secure livelihoods.</P><ASIDE class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded"" data-component=""rich-link"" data-link-name=""rich-link-2 | 2""><DIV class=""rich-link""><DIV class=""rich-link__container""><DIV class=""rich-link__header""><H1 class=""rich-link__title"">Southern Africa cries for help as El Niño and <mark>climate change</mark> savage maize harvest</H1></DIV><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more""><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more-text"">

We are told that the opponents of industrial agriculture want to eschew technological advance and keep developing regions mired in non-mechanised, subsistence-style agriculture. However, this is a false dichotomy. </P><P>A transition to diversified agro-ecological systems is needed, whether the starting point is industrial agriculture or subsistence-style farming.

– Jeff Goodell</P></BLOCKQUOTE><H2><STRONG>Natural Causes of <mark>Climate Change</mark></STRONG></H2><OL><LI><STRONG>Solar Output</STRONG></LI></OL><P>As the Suns intensity strengthens or weakens, the amount of energy radiated to Earth’s atmosphere changes. Changes in the sun’s intensity (solar irradiance) have influenced energy shifts for centuries, however, solar energy has not changed enough recently to account for the global warming we’re now experiencing. In fact, measurements have shown a slight decrease in intensity in the past few decades.</P><OL start=""2""><LI><STRONG>Orbital Shifts</STRONG></LI></OL><P>As the Earth orbits around the sun, slight variations in its orbit occur, much as the globe model in geography class wobbles on its axis. This changes how much of the sun’s energy reaches the Earth. These variations are considered too long-term, however, and, while they do affect the Earth’s energy input, do not really have a noticeable effect on the huge <mark>climate change</mark>s that have occurred during human’s existence.</P><OL start=""3""><LI><STRONG>Volcanic Activity</STRONG></LI></OL><P>Volcanic eruptions affect how much energy can enter the Earth due to the aerosol particles that are expelled into the atmosphere. This only happens episodically, however, and has short-term effects on the <mark>climate</mark>. Moreover, while <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide is released into the air, its amounts are minimal and the aerosols released into the air actually serve to cool the Earth down by blocking sunlight. The lava expelled by eruption volcanoes does not contribute to global warming either, as it only covers a small area. Thus, while volcanic eruptions are always included in <mark>climate</mark> forcer lists, its contribution is actually up for debate.</P><OL start=""4""><LI><STRONG>Continental Drift</STRONG></LI></OL><P>All the separate continents gradually drifted apart over a span of 250 million years, and they are still drifting today. This shifting of large landmasses changed ocean current flow and winds and altered the atmosphere. As in the case of other natural causes of <mark>climate change</mark> mentioned here, however, the effects of continental drift is considered to be too small to be a real contributor.</P><P><STRONG>Internal <mark>Climate</mark> Causes</STRONG></P><OL><LI><STRONG>Seasonal Changes</STRONG></LI></OL><P>Seasonal changes occur naturally and they themselves encourage <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide release. Warmer oceans or autumnal leaf fall are two such seasonal changes that impact energy input.</P><OL start=""2""><LI><STRONG>El Nino-La Nina</STRONG></LI></OL><P>Around every 4 years, El Nino starts over the Pacific Ocean when the trade winds blowing over it from East to West weaken. Warm surface water that is normally pushed westward slows down. The water surface of the eastern Pacific heats up while the water surface of the western Pacific cools down.</P><P>Converse conditions known as La Nina sometimes follows El Nino during which the surface waters of the eastern Pacific cool down instead. Both these conditions affect circulation patterns in the atmosphere and, ultimately, influence the <mark>climate</mark>. El Nino raises global temperatures whereas La Nina decreases it.</P><OL start=""3""><LI><STRONG>Arctic Oscillation</STRONG></LI></OL><P>Changing air pressure patterns in the northern hemisphere causes arctic oscillation. Normally the atmospheric pressure in the polar regions are opposite to one another. The first stage of Arctic oscillation causes this pressure difference to widen even more, which raises temperatures in parts of Europe and North America and lowers temperatures in the Arctic. The second stage of the oscillation brings about the opposite effect. Arctic oscillation influences regional weather more than global temperature.</P><H2><STRONG>Man-made Causes of <mark>Climate Change</mark></STRONG></H2><P>We are accelerating the rate of <mark>climate change</mark> far past what the influence of the sun or any natural forcer could achieve. Processes in our daily lives are expelling chemicals and foreign substances into the air that affect and increase the natural greenhouse gases, which then absorb more energy from the sun. This results in global warming and changes the <mark>climate</mark>.</P><OL><LI><STRONG>Greenhouse Gas Emission</STRONG></LI></OL><P>Greenhouse gas emission is said to be the largest man-made <mark>climate</mark> forcer as it is so prevalent and large-scale. Greenhouse gases occur naturally in the atmosphere and they serve to absorb and radiate the Sun’s heat around the globe for the benefit of life. Humans are now producing large amounts of these gasses on such a level that it has upset energy balance.</P><P>Some of these greenhouse gases are long-lived like <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and nitrous oxide, so the damage they cause is obvious. However, short-lived substances like methane still affect the energy balance as they are very potent and there are so many of them. Moreover, human activity continues to release them into the atmosphere.</P><OL start=""2""><LI><STRONG>Fossil Fuel Usage</STRONG></LI></OL><P>Fossil fuel burning produces, among other chemicals, <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide that is the primary greenhouse gas forcer of <mark>climate change</mark>. In itself it is not a particularly warming gas, but the amount that we are emitting into the atmosphere makes it the most damaging. It also has a long life in the atmosphere, only fully dissipating after 50,000 years during which time it continues to absorb and radiate heat.</P><OL start=""3""><LI><STRONG>Black <mark>Carbon</mark></STRONG></LI></OL><P>Another by-product of fossil fuels is black <mark>carbon</mark>, which is produced when fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass are not properly combusted and emit soot. It enters the atmosphere as fine particles (aerosols) and absorbs large amounts of heat and infrared radiation. The majority of black <mark>carbon</mark> in the U.S. is emitted from vehicles, especially diesel-fuelled ones. Wildfires and industrial and residential heating are also black <mark>carbon</mark> emitters.</P><P>Black <mark>carbon</mark> is drifted across the globe on winds, and can be deposited on snow or ice. This darkens snow or ice, thus increasing its ability to absorb heat. This, in turn, forces the ice to melt faster.</P><OL start=""4""><LI><STRONG>Industrial Production &amp; Farming</STRONG></LI></OL><P>Emissions from factories contribute directly to the greenhouse effect while runoff waste alters the chemical make-up of water and air. Chemical pesticides, herbicides and fungicides used in industrial farming also wreak havoc to the atmosphere. Livestock farming also releases large amounts of methane into the air, driving up the amount of greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere.</P><OL start=""5""><LI><STRONG>Agriculture</STRONG></LI></OL><P>Agriculture accounts for 14% of total greenhouse gas emissions, and with the need for more agriculture to provide for our ever-growing needs, its impact is growing rapidly. The main agricultural contributors to <mark>climate</mark> forcers include <mark>carbon</mark> released from farmland soil by inappropriate farming and grazing practices.</P><P>Changes in land use for agriculture is also a large contributor to <mark>climate change</mark>. <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillage"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Tillage</A> and water rerouting has accelerated soil erosion, soil organic matter has been lost due to chemicals, and soil itself has been altered and polluted by chemical fertilizers, all of which affect the atmosphere with various emissions.</P><OL start=""6""><LI><STRONG>Deforestation</STRONG></LI></OL><P>Vast swatches of primary forests are being wiped out to make way for un<mark>sustainable</mark> farming, urbanization or for logging and the production of paper goods. Trees absorb <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide from the atmosphere, so as more trees are cut down, the level of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the air will increase. In short, deforestation affects <mark>climate</mark> in a big way.</P><OL start=""7""><LI><STRONG>Urbanization</STRONG></LI></OL><P>As our populations increase and our cities reach maximum capacity, we start to expand them in what is called urban sprawl. This decreases the amount of vegetation available to absorb <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide. In turn, urbanization means more greenhouse gas, <mark>pollution</mark> and waste output.</P><P>Other damaging side effects of urbanization include the Heat Island Effect: air and surface temperatures are driven higher above urban areas than above rural areas due to concentrated usage of fossil fuels, electricity etc. As urban areas grow, so will the number of heat islands, which will drive up the overall atmospheric temperature. A side effect of this side effect is that water vapor above urban areas will also be driven up, causing more clouds and rain.</P><OL start=""8""><LI><STRONG>Sulfates, Organic <mark>Carbon</mark>s &amp; Aerosols (small particles)</STRONG></LI></OL><P>These are actually negative forcers, but warming and cooling aerosols can change some of the processes of clouds. As negative forcers, clouds reflect sunlight back up. As positive forcers, they trap outgoing heat.</P><P>One cause of <mark>climate change</mark> that is up for debate as to whether it is natural or man-made is our very own respiration. Every breath we take releases <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide into the atmosphere. Whatever it is, we all impact <mark>climate change</mark>, so we should all make the effort to slow it down too.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Rural development stalled and rural poverty expanded during the 1990s. Population growth remains very high, and declining per-capita agricultural capacity retards progress toward Millennium Development goals. Analyses of <EM>in situ</EM> station data and satellite observations of precipitation have identified another problematic trend: main growing-season rainfall receipts have diminished by ≈15% in food-insecure countries clustered along the western rim of the Indian Ocean. Occurring during the main growing seasons in poor countries dependent on rain-fed agriculture, these declines are societally dangerous. Will they persist or intensify? Tracing moisture deficits upstream to an anthropogenically warming Indian Ocean leads us to conclude that further rainfall declines are likely. We present analyses suggesting that warming in the central Indian Ocean disrupts onshore moisture transports, reducing continental rainfall. Thus, late 20th-century anthropogenic Indian Ocean warming has probably already produced societally dangerous <mark>climate change</mark> by creating drought and social disruption in some of the world's most fragile food economies. We quantify the potential impacts of the observed precipitation and agricultural capacity trends by modeling “millions of undernourished people” as a function of rainfall, population, cultivated area, seed, and fertilizer use. Persistence of current tendencies may result in a 50% increase in undernourished people by 2030. On the other hand, modest increases in per-capita agricultural productivity could more than offset the observed precipitation declines. Investing in agricultural development can help mitigate <mark>climate change</mark> while decreasing rural poverty and vulnerability.</P></DIV><UL class=""kwd-group""><LI class=""kwd""><A href=""/keyword/precipitation"" class=""hw-term hw-article-keyword hw-article-keyword-precipitation"" rel=""nofollow"">precipitation</A></LI></UL><P id=""p-5"">Sustainability science often examines trends and the interaction of trends (<A id=""xref-ref-1-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-1"">1</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-2-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-2"">2</A>) through the lens of “use-inspired basic research” (<A id=""xref-ref-1-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-1"">1</A>). We present here an analysis of rainfall and agricultural capacity trends inspired by our research supporting earlier early warning for the U.S. Agency for International Development's Famine Early Warning System [<A href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/data/0708196105/DCSupplemental/Supplemental_PDF#nameddest=ST1"">supporting information (SI) Table S1</A>]. Most of this work has focused on monitoring and predicting emerging drought conditions in eastern and southern Africa (<A id=""xref-ref-3-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-3"">3</A><A id=""xref-ref-4-1"" class=""xref-down-link"" href=""#ref-4""><SPAN>⇓</SPAN></A>–<A id=""xref-ref-5-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-5"">5</A>), one way of improving adaptive capacity (<A id=""xref-ref-6-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-6"">6</A>) recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC). In 2003, however, a routine attempt to use early-season (March to April) rainfall as a predictor of late-season (September to October) crop production produced a disturbing discovery: substantial rainfall declines had occurred within critical crop-growing areas in Ethiopia. The location and timing of these trends made them dangerous. Further analysis suggested links to drought across much of eastern Africa during the long-rains season and potential anthropogenic links to the central Indian Ocean (<A id=""xref-ref-3-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-3"">3</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-5-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-5"">5</A>). In addition to <mark>climate</mark> analysis, this work also included evaluations of population, agriculture, and water security. We find that in eastern and southern Africa, the combination of declining per-capita agricultural capacity (<A id=""xref-ref-7-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-7"">7</A>) and increasing aridity is exacerbating vulnerability (<A id=""xref-ref-8-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-8"">8</A>) and rural poverty (<A id=""xref-ref-9-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-9"">9</A>). Declining investments in rural development, rapidly increasing rural populations, the depletion of soil nutrients through erosion, and the cultivation of most cultivatable areas limit agricultural productivity growth (<A id=""xref-ref-10-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-10"">10</A>). Low per-capita agricultural production and rural poverty go hand in hand, slowing progress toward Millennium Development goals (MDGs). A recent overview of these goals (<A id=""xref-ref-11-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-11"">11</A>) indicated differential progress on different fronts. Education and economic conditions have improved. Population growth remains high (2.3% per year). Progress on hunger and health has been halting. Our concern is that post-1980 rainfall declines during the main eastern African long rains (March–April–May, MAM) and the main southern African summer rains (December–January–February, DJF) may be contributing to African food insecurity. We believe that these declines may be associated with anthropogenic warming in the Indian Ocean. If so, these precipitation declines, acting in concert with declining agricultural capacity, likely constitute a prime example of societally dangerous <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P id=""p-6"">In this report we quantify the likely impact of observed precipitation and agricultural capacity trends by using empirical food-balance indicator models. These models estimate the millions of undernourished people as a function of population, cropped area, seed use, fertilizer applications, and main growing-season precipitation. These models show that continued declines in rainfall and per-capita agricultural capacity will produce increasing food insecurity. We next use observations and <mark>climate</mark> model simulations to argue that recent declines in eastern and southern African growing-season rainfall are linked to anthropogenic warming in the Indian Ocean. This link to global warming implies that these precipitation declines are likely to continue or intensify. For eastern Africa, this result is at odds with the most recent IPCC assessment (<A id=""xref-ref-12-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-12"">12</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-13-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-13"">13</A>), which anticipates precipitation increases. For southern Africa, this result is consistent with previous analyses (<A id=""xref-ref-13-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-13"">13</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-14-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-14"">14</A>), which anticipate rainfall declines. Here we argue that warming in the south-central Indian Ocean (0–15°S, 60–90°E) has a similar effect on near-coastal eastern and southern Africa during boreal winter and spring. In each season, oceanic warming seems to reduce onshore moisture transports (<A id=""xref-ref-5-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-5"">5</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-15-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-15"">15</A><A id=""xref-ref-16-1"" class=""xref-down-link"" href=""#ref-16""><SPAN>⇓</SPAN></A>–<A id=""xref-ref-17-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-17"">17</A>) while increasing continental atmospheric stability. This may explain recent drought tendencies in gauge data, satellite-observed precipitation,<A id=""xref-fn-6-1"" class=""xref-fn"" href=""#fn-6"">**</A> lake levels (<A id=""xref-ref-5-4"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-5"">5</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-16-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-16"">16</A>), and vegetation indices in densely populated water-insecure regions of eastern African. If a common anthropogenic Walker-cell-like disruption has caused declines in both southern and eastern African rainfall, then this disruption is likely to persist. Furthermore, recent <mark>climate</mark>-change impact assessments (<A id=""xref-ref-18-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-18"">18</A>), based on optimistic precipitation simulations over eastern Africa, may underestimate yield reductions (<A id=""xref-ref-4-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-4"">4</A>). Our food-balance modeling of millions of undernourished people, however, suggests that these impacts could be mitigated by agricultural development.</P><DIV class=""section"" id=""sec-1""><H2>Modeling the Impacts of Agricultural Capacity and Rainfall</H2><P id=""p-7"">Over the past 25 years the population of food-insecure eastern and southern Africa has doubled while per-capita cropped area has declined by 33% and the millions of undernourished people increased by 80% (<A id=""xref-ref-19-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-19"">19</A>). Today, one in three small children is dangerously underweight, and 40% of 308 million people are undernourished. Average national per-capita cropped-area values are often below 1,000 m<SUP>2</SUP> per person.<A id=""xref-fn-7-1"" class=""xref-fn"" href=""#fn-7""><SUP>††</SUP></A> Food aid has become chronic, with 2005 World Food Program aid valued at U.S. $200 million. Poor farmers in these countries, often trapped in cycles of displacement, division, and degradation (<A id=""xref-ref-20-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-20"">20</A>), depend on rain-fed agriculture (<A id=""xref-ref-21-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-21"">21</A>). Per-capita crop production is an important metric of food availability and security. Limited technological inputs create a strong dependence between national average cropped area and national average production (<EM>r</EM> = 0.95).</P><P id=""p-8"">Recent agricultural capacity trends tend to be dominated by cropped-area and population-growth increases.<A id=""xref-fn-6-2"" class=""xref-fn"" href=""#fn-6"">**</A> In general, increased food production has matched growing population through increased labor inputs and through extensification, with area under cultivation increasing by 50% over the past 25 years while population has almost doubled (<A id=""xref-fig-1-1"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F1"">Fig. 1</A><EM>A</EM>). Seed and fertilizer use has also lagged population growth. Unfortunately, since 1990, overseas agricultural assistance has declined from 12% to 4% of total foreign aid (<A id=""xref-ref-7-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-7"">7</A>), and only 4% of African public spending goes to agriculture (<A id=""xref-ref-7-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-7"">7</A>). This declining investment in agriculture has contributed to stalling increases in agricultural inputs. As the gap between population growth and structural agricultural components continues to grow, vulnerability and rural poverty will increase, amplifying the impact of agricultural droughts. These droughts have seemed to be more severe in recent years (<A id=""xref-fig-1-2"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F1"">Fig. 1</A><EM>A</EM>), and main growing-season rainfall<A id=""xref-fn-6-3"" class=""xref-fn"" href=""#fn-6"">**</A> has declined by ≈15% across eastern and southern Africa, in step with recent increases in radiative forcing (<A id=""xref-ref-22-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-22"">22</A>).

Agricultural capacity represents the slowly varying nonweather component of a national food balance and is a function of cropped area and seeds and fertilizer divided by population with units of per-capita crop production (kg per person per year). <A id=""xref-fig-1-3"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F1"">Fig. 1</A><EM>B</EM> shows main growing-season rainfall and per-capita agricultural capacity trends for 10 eastern and southern African nations. Somalia has been excluded as a result of limited data. The downward-pointing arrows indicate countries that experienced key growing-season rainfall declines between 1979 and 2005 (Ethiopia, Kenya, Burundi, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe). Note the geographic clustering of observed rainfall declines along Africa's eastern seaboard. Countries with left-pointing vectors (Ethiopia, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) have experienced 1994–2003 declines in per capita agricultural capacity. In these countries population has grown faster than agricultural infrastructure, leading to increased rural poverty and vulnerability to climatic shocks.</P><P id=""p-11"">In these semiarid countries a strong dependence on rain-fed smallholder farming practices results in quasilinear relationships between grain yields, seasonal rainfall receipts, and food deficits. Hence, agricultural capacity multiplied by percent normal rainfall is strongly related to per-capita production. The inverse of this measure (food imbalance) is related to food insecurity.<A id=""xref-fn-6-4"" class=""xref-fn"" href=""#fn-6"">**</A> For each country (except Ethiopia, because of data limitations), the food-imbalance measure was regressed against “millions of undernourished” statistics obtained from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. These regressions give us a pragmatic means of translating changes in rainfall, cropped area, and seed and fertilizer use into an index of food insecurity that is grounded empirically by historic observations. The resulting model performed well at a national/interannual scale for eastern and southern Africa (<EM>r</EM> = 0.86, <EM>P</EM> = 1.6 × 10<SUP>−5</SUP>). To stress the semiquantitative nature of these projections, we present our results as percent changes from a 2000 baseline, which also allows comparison with the MDG of halving the number of undernourished people by 2015.</P><P id=""p-12"">Three scenarios were examined (<A id=""xref-fig-1-4"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F1"">Fig. 1</A><EM>C</EM>). Scenario 1 represents a “business as usual” future. Recent precipitation and agricultural capacity trends were assumed to persist through 2030. Under this scenario, the aggregate tendencies shown in <A id=""xref-fig-1-5"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F1"">Fig. 1</A><EM>A</EM> continue, and undernourishment increases by 53% between 2000 and 2030. The effects of agricultural capacity declines alone can be seen in scenario 2. Undernourishment increases by 23%. On the other hand, evaluating a combination of observed rainfall declines paired with moderate increases in per-capita agricultural capacity of 2 kg per person per year (scenario 3), equivalent to a 2% per-capita growth rate, exhibited substantial (38%) declines in undernourishment. Drought interacts dangerously with low agricultural capacity, but its effects can be mitigated through agricultural development.</P></DIV><DIV class=""section"" id=""sec-2""><H2>Walker-Cell-Like Anomalies May Explain Observed Rainfall Declines</H2><P id=""p-13"">Will the observed rainfall declines (<A id=""xref-fig-1-6"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F1"">Fig. 1</A>) persist, increasing levels of undernourishment (<A id=""xref-fig-1-7"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F1"">Fig. 1</A><EM>C</EM>)? Fueling this concern is the strong covariance between global temperatures (<EM>r</EM> = 0.82) and south-central Indian Ocean (0–15°S, 60–90°E) sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Both have risen dramatically since the 1980s, along with radiative forcing (<A id=""xref-fig-2-1"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">Fig. 2</A><EM>A</EM>), and tropical Indian Ocean SSTs recently reached their highest value in 120,000 years (<A id=""xref-ref-23-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-23"">23</A>). Although anthropogenic warming has occurred in all oceans (<A id=""xref-ref-24-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-24"">24</A>), this warming has been larger in the Indian Ocean (<A id=""xref-ref-25-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-25"">25</A>). Recent careful analysis identified an 0.5–1.0°C 1960–1999 SST increase in the Indian Ocean Thermal Archive (<A id=""xref-ref-26-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-26"">26</A>). This study also finds that most (7 of 10) World <mark>Climate</mark> Research Program Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (<A id=""xref-ref-27-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-27"">27</A>) (CMIP3) models recreate this tropical warming tendency, strongly implicating greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions in the recent observed warming (<A id=""xref-fig-2-2"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">Fig. 2</A><EM>A</EM>). Modeled CMIP3 increases in southern tropical Indian Ocean temperatures are strongly linked to trends in equatorial Pacific zonal wind stress and southward shifts in the latitudinal position of the subtropical gyre.

The latitude of negative associations shifts with the march of seasons, following the thermal equator and path of maximum onshore moisture transports (shown schematically with arrows).</P><P id=""p-16"">The connection between seasonal moisture transports and central Indian Ocean warming (represented by precipitation) can be explored empirically by canonical correlation analysis (CCA). CCA is a statistical technique that finds dominant patterns of covariability in two sets of multivariate data. The two sets of data examined were seasonal 1950–2005 zonal reanalysis moisture transports over Africa's eastern seaboard (20°N–20°S, 25°E–45°E) and seasonal tropical Indian Ocean precipitation (15°N–15°S, 55°E–90°E). Tropical oceanic precipitation is linearly related to diabatic atmospheric heating, which can produce east–west Walker-cell-like circulation anomalies (<A id=""xref-ref-31-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-31"">31</A>). Our hypothesis is that these anomalous circulations control decadal rainfall fluctuations that endanger food-insecure countries along the eastern seaboard of Africa (<A id=""xref-fig-1-8"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F1"">Fig. 1</A><EM>B</EM>).</P><P id=""p-17""><A id=""xref-fig-2-4"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">Fig. 2</A><EM>C</EM> shows our CCA results for MAM (other seasons are presented in <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/data/0708196105/DCSupplemental/Supplemental_PDF#nameddest=SF1"">Fig. S1</A>). In each season, we find that the first canonical correlate identifies a first CCA pattern describing shared Indian Ocean precipitation and moisture-transport variations. This approach produces a time series describing covariant Indian Ocean precipitation (CC<SUB>P</SUB>) and moisture transports (CC<SUB>M</SUB>). Increasing tropical Indian Ocean precipitation (blue circles) is associated with atmospheric ridging and anticyclonic moisture circulation over eastern Africa (arrows), which disrupt the main onshore moisture flows (shown with blue shading). University of Delaware precipitation deficits for the strongest six oceanic precipitation events are shown with red boxes. Although only boreal spring results are shown here, the patterns for other seasons are similar; a Walker-cell-like dipole emerges as the dominant (first canonical correlate) relationship. The transport correlations indicate reduced onshore moisture fluxes between 0 and 15°S. This region supplies 66% of Indian Ocean-sourced zonal moisture transport into tropical Africa, and 83% of the annual mean zonal moisture transport entering tropical Africa originates in the Indian Ocean. The northern flanks of the CCA patterns are associated with transport anomalies flowing from the drier Sahelian regions. Thus, changes in central Indian Ocean precipitation are correlated with transitions between dry continental and moist oceanic air masses over tropical Africa.</P><P id=""p-18"">At low (decadal) frequencies, correlations between the CC<SUB>M</SUB> and CC<SUB>P</SUB> approach unity, and the zonal transport indices are negatively correlated (<EM>r</EM> ≈ −0.9) with regional rainfall (<A id=""xref-table-wrap-1-1"" class=""xref-table"" href=""#T1"">Table 1</A>). In total the CCA-identified transports can explain 85% of the low frequency variations in eastern MAM, southern DJF, and Sahelian June–July–August (JJA) rainfall. All three seasons/regions experienced a 1960–1970 decline in observed rainfall and CCA transport forcing, in synchrony with anthropogenic 1960–1970 increases in Indian Ocean heat content (<A id=""xref-ref-24-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-24"">24</A><A id=""xref-ref-25-2"" class=""xref-down-link"" href=""#ref-25""><SPAN>⇓</SPAN></A>–<A id=""xref-ref-26-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-26"">26</A>). A second heat-content increase in the early 1980s was associated with MAM and DJF transport disruptions and drying tendencies in southern and eastern Africa. Slower increases in JJA transport disruptions, combined with north/south shifts in Atlantic SSTs, have likely led to a modest recovery in Sahelian rainfall (<A id=""xref-ref-14-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-14"">14</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-32-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-32"">32</A>), albeit with continued declines across the eastern Sahel and southern Ethiopia (<A id=""xref-ref-32-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-32"">32</A>).</P><DIV class=""table pos-float"" id=""T1""><DIV class=""table-inline table-callout-links""><DIV class=""callout""><SPAN>View this table:</SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""table-caption""><SPAN class=""table-label"">Table 1.</SPAN><P id=""p-19"" class=""first-child"">Correlations between <mark>climate</mark>, rainfall, and food-security indices</P></DIV></DIV><P id=""p-20"">To examine the influence of diabatic heating on moisture transports in a simulation framework, we have also conducted experiments with the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmosphere Model,<A id=""xref-fn-6-7"" class=""xref-fn"" href=""#fn-6"">**</A> a fully nonlinear atmospheric model with explicitly resolved moist processes. An additional diabatic heating term is added over the central Indian Ocean, which increases the local rainfall, as in the work by Barlow <EM>et al.</EM> (<A id=""xref-ref-33-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-33"">33</A>). The added heating is sinusoidal in latitude and longitude for a half period over the domain −20°S to 5°N and 50 to 100°E with a magnitude of 0.02 W·kg<SUP>−1</SUP>. This southern central Indian Ocean domain was chosen to match our previous observational analyses (<A id=""xref-ref-5-5"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-5"">5</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-16-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-16"">16</A>) and the early assertion that enhanced cyclonic activity helped create the tragic 1984 Ethiopian famine (<A id=""xref-ref-30-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-30"">30</A>). A clear influence on moisture transport over the interior of Africa is observed (<A id=""xref-fig-2-5"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">Fig. 2</A><EM>D</EM>), in good agreement with the expectations of simple Gill-type dynamics, and is associated with decreases in local rainfall. These MAM circulation anomalies are similar to previous modeling results for JFM (<A id=""xref-ref-17-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-17"">17</A>), and the observed low-level circulation anomalies associated with warm Indian Ocean warming seasons for boreal spring (<A id=""xref-fig-2-6"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">Fig. 2</A><EM>C</EM>). Thus, although the relevance of the simple Gill model might be questioned, especially because it neglects the mean wind (<A id=""xref-ref-34-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-34"">34</A>), the general link between increased central Indian Ocean precipitation and decreased onshore moisture transport seems robust even in a full atmospheric model.</P><P id=""p-21"">In summary, the strong, probably anthropogenic (<A id=""xref-ref-24-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-24"">24</A><A id=""xref-ref-25-3"" class=""xref-down-link"" href=""#ref-25""><SPAN>⇓</SPAN></A>–<A id=""xref-ref-26-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-26"">26</A>), warming of the south-central Indian Ocean (<A id=""xref-fig-2-7"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">Fig. 2</A><EM>A</EM>) increases maritime precipitation, which is statistically and dynamically related to continental rainfall declines and moisture-transport reductions (<A id=""xref-fig-2-8"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">Fig. 2</A><EM>B</EM> and <EM>C</EM>).

The time series at each longitude was translated into <EM>z</EM> scores (SDs) and plotted with red (blue), indicating reduced (enhanced) precipitation. As greenhouse gas forcing increases with time, beginning in the 1970s, precipitation increases across the Indian Ocean and declines across tropical Africa. This timing is broadly consistent with observed increases in oceanic SSTs (<A id=""xref-fig-2-11"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">Fig. 2</A><EM>A</EM>) and reductions in continental rainfall (<A id=""xref-fig-1-10"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F1"">Fig. 1</A><EM>A</EM>). We can analyze scatter surrounding the CMIP3 <mark>climate</mark>-change consensus by translating the 132 individual precipitation simulations into time-varying probability distribution functions (PDFs),<A id=""xref-fn-6-9"" class=""xref-fn"" href=""#fn-6"">**</A> (<A id=""xref-ref-36-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-36"">36</A>). <A id=""xref-fig-3-3"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F3"">Fig. 3</A><EM>B</EM> shows the multimodel ensemble precipitation PDFs over the tropical Indian Ocean (0–15°S, 60–90°E). As greenhouse gasses and aerosols accumulate in the atmosphere, the Indian Ocean warms, and oceanic precipitation increases, presumably producing moisture-transport variations and tropical African rainfall declines similar to those shown in <A id=""xref-fig-2-12"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">Fig. 2</A>. The PDFs are tight and trend strongly, increasing steeply after the mid-1970s, in step with radiative forcing increases (<A id=""xref-ref-22-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-22"">22</A>) and observed African rainfall declines (<A id=""xref-fig-1-11"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F1"">Fig. 1</A>), so that by late in the 21st century the ranges of precipitation projected are quite different from historical ranges. <A id=""xref-fig-3-4"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F3"">Fig. 3</A><EM>C</EM> shows Indian Ocean precipitation changes for the 11 different individual models (<EM>x</EM> axis) along with the correlation between each model's multisimulation mean time series and the ensemble mean (<EM>y</EM>). All models exhibit positive correlations, so that the models were unanimous in projecting increases in MAM atmospheric warming (i.e., precipitation) over the tropical Indian Ocean. The frequency with which MAM central Indian Ocean precipitation totals in 2031–2050 exceeded the average rainfall total for 1951–1970 increased by &gt;20% in 10 of the 11 models. Taken together, <A id=""xref-fig-3-5"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F3"">Fig. 3</A> indicates a tilt of the odds toward more precipitation over the Indian Ocean and less precipitation over Africa's eastern seaboard.</P></DIV><DIV class=""section"" id=""sec-4""><H2>Summary and Conclusions</H2><P id=""p-25"">Two independent, but interacting, post-1980 tendencies have contributed to food insecurity in eastern and southern Africa (<A id=""xref-fig-1-12"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F1"">Fig. 1</A>). First, population growth has exceeded increases in agricultural infrastructure and cultivated area. Second, there has been a tendency for main growing-season rainfall to decline. Empirical and model-based explorations (<A id=""xref-fig-2-13"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">Fig. 2</A> and <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/data/0708196105/DCSupplemental/Supplemental_PDF#nameddest=SF1"">Fig. S1</A>) support assertions that Walker-cell-like disruptions of atmospheric circulations and moisture transports link a warming Indian Ocean to a drier eastern African seaboard. Multimodel CMIP3 ensembles (<A id=""xref-fig-3-6"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F3"">Fig. 3</A>) (<A id=""xref-ref-17-4"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-17"">17</A>) suggest greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions have contributed substantially to this observed late 20th-century warming (<A id=""xref-fig-2-14"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">Fig. 2</A><EM>A</EM>). Anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> has probably produced societally dangerous increases in eastern and southern African food security. These conclusions, in general, agree with the most recent Fourth IPCC finding that semiarid Africa may experience large-scale water stress (<A id=""xref-ref-37-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-37"">37</A>) and yield reductions (<A id=""xref-ref-18-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-18"">18</A>) by 2030.</P><P id=""p-26"">The work presented here, however, differs in approach from the IPCC analysis, focusing on empirical relationships rather than raw CMIP3 precipitation simulations. These raw simulations have implied that eastern Africa might become wetter while southern Africa becomes drier (<A id=""xref-ref-12-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-12"">12</A>). We question the fidelity, in general, of continental precipitation simulations, especially over the extremely complex terrain of east Africa. Global models suppress important local mechanisms [internal thermal and orographic gravity waves (<A id=""xref-ref-38-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-38"">38</A>)] and vary substantially in their ability to represent the transient systems that draw kinetic energy from the mean circulation, overcoming stability inhibitions and producing organized mesoscale convection (<A id=""xref-ref-39-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-39"">39</A>). Even monthly reanalysis precipitation fields have almost no skill (<EM>R</EM><SUP>2</SUP>&lt; 0.2) compared with observations in eastern Africa. Given this uncertainty, we believe that the observed quasilinear negative relationships between central Indian Ocean warming and east African rainfall represents the mostly likely outcome. These anthropogenic drought tendencies may be indicative of other “Indian Rim” and South American countries as well, because similar precipitation reformulations also suggest 21st century main season declines (<A id=""xref-ref-40-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-40"">40</A>), with the result that main growing-season droughts may disproportionately affect tropical and subtropical countries. Global assessments of anthropogenic precipitation (<A id=""xref-ref-13-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-13"">13</A>) and yield (<A id=""xref-ref-18-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-18"">18</A>) changes may be underestimating these drought signals. The <mark>climate</mark>-change impacts in low-income nations have been almost completely driven by emissions from middle- and high-income countries (<A id=""xref-ref-41-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-41"">41</A>). Although more research, and better <mark>climate</mark> models, will be required to settle quantitatively issues of attribution, the social and economic disruptions associated with anthropogenic drought may add substantially to these impacts.</P><P id=""p-27"">Vulnerability arises through a complex interplay of exposures, sensitivities, and resiliencies that can either dampen or amplify the impact of climatic shocks (<A id=""xref-ref-8-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-8"">8</A>). The recent IPCC assessment identifies many means of enhancing adaptive capacity (<A id=""xref-ref-6-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-6"">6</A>) in Africa. Improved forecasts and earlier early warning can help (<A id=""xref-ref-4-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-4"">4</A>), as can improving existing rain-fed agriculture through farm management (<A id=""xref-ref-42-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-42"">42</A>) (cf. table 2 in ref. <A id=""xref-ref-6-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-6"">6</A>), as can enhanced biotechnological (<A id=""xref-ref-43-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-43"">43</A>) inputs. Recent research has suggested that investments in African agricultural development will lead to substantial propoor economic growth (<A id=""xref-ref-43-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-43"">43</A><A id=""xref-ref-44-1"" class=""xref-down-link"" href=""#ref-44""><SPAN>⇓</SPAN></A>–<A id=""xref-ref-45-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-45"">45</A>). Our analysis suggests that the continuation of recent tendencies will be likely to result in continued increases in undernourishment; but this is not a <EM>fait accompli</EM>. The range of possible human outcomes is large and depends primarily on the choices that we make. By 2025 rates of child malnutrition, for example, could range from 9.4 to 41.9 million (<A id=""xref-ref-46-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-46"">46</A>). Our agricultural capacity models suggest that a 15% increase in yields per decade (equivalent to a 2 kg per person per year increase in agricultural capacity) could come close to achieving the MDG of halving the number of undernourished people, albeit by 2030 rather than 2015.</P><P id=""p-28"">Although notable achievements in economic growth and education have been made since 1999, recent progress on hunger in Africa has been very slow (<A id=""xref-ref-11-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-11"">11</A>) and has fallen short of keeping pace with the relatively rapid population growth. The past few years have seen an increased governmental appreciation of the role of agricultural development (<A id=""xref-ref-7-4"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-7"">7</A>), but public investments in agriculture and international donor assistance have lagged behind MDG commitments (<A id=""xref-ref-11-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-11"">11</A>). More and higher quality assistance and agricultural polices, guided by objective policy design and better governance, can help eastern and southern Africa achieve sustainability transition. Investments in agricultural capacity seem warranted, given the large financial and humanitarian costs of business as usual in a changing <mark>climate</mark> system. These investments may also be just, given the strong evidence for anthropogenic drought and the disproportionate emissions by middle- and high-income countries (<A id=""xref-ref-41-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-41"">41</A>).</P></DIV><DIV class=""section ack"" id=""ack-1""><H2>Acknowledgments</H2><P id=""p-34"">This research was supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development Famine Early Warning System Network under U.S. Geological Survey Cooperative Agreement 04HQAG0001, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration under Precipitation Science Grant NNX07AG26G, National Aeronautics and Space Administration decision support grant NNG07HW21G, and by the National Science Foundation under Grants ATM 0603555 and ATM 0621237.
