The potential collapse of one of the world's major commodities traders has global investors spooked, writes Ian Verrender.</EM></STRONG></P><P>For years, he has been known as Ivan the Terrible.</P><P>Not to his face, mind you. But never was a nickname more apt. And, given the dramatic turn of events in the past year, never was a moniker richer in irony.</P><P>Ivan Glasenberg is an Australian. He wasn't born here. He doesn't live here. And he almost certainly pays as little tax as possible here, despite being, until recently, the second richest person in the land.</P><P>In many respects, Glasenberg and the company he keeps - commodities trader Glencore - is at once a metaphor for everything that is wrong with Australia while being a potential catalyst for a crisis that could wreak havoc with the economy.</P><P>A year ago, Glasenberg was threatening to wrest control of mining juggernaut Rio Tinto.</P><P>But last week, reports out of London of a possible collapse in Glencore swept through global markets, hammered commodity prices and unhinged equity markets from London to Hong Kong and all stops in between.</P><P>Despite the vehement denials late last week, the crisis surrounding Glencore has eerie parallels to the financial market implosion in 2008 that led to the collapse of Lehman Bros which plunged the global financial system into chaos.</P><P>It's difficult not to draw comparisons. The 2008 crisis was born out of hugely complex financial instruments based upon property speculation and the mistaken belief that asset prices will only ever head higher.</P><P>Now it is a far more earthy substance. Commodities hard and soft - mineral, agricultural and energy - have been on a bender for a decade and a half. Even the great meltdown of 2008 only briefly interrupted the binge as China embarked upon the greatest economic transformation in history.</P><P>Australia was handsomely rewarded. So too was Ivan Glasenberg and his team at the mysterious and highly secretive Glencore, one of the world's biggest commodities traders.</P><P>Headquartered in tax friendly Zug, Switzerland, Glencore was the brainchild of Marc Rich, an American tax fugitive who for years was one of the CIA's most wanted until Bill Clinton pardoned him on his last day as president.</P><P>Starting with oil, the company now is involved in trading almost every commodity conceivable, bridging the gap between surpluses in one area and shortages in others and arbitraging between minute price differences in different markets.</P><P>The grease that keeps those trade wheels turning is credit, trade credit. And when that evaporated during the Lehman crisis, Glencore almost came horribly unstuck. Given its intensely private structure at the time, few realised just how close to catastrophe the company had come.</P><P>That forced Glasenberg to list the group on the London Stock Exchange so that it could gain access to capital, in a bid to ensure it never again ran short of cash. But four years later, the company is in a similar situation. Only this time, its public listing has put its predicament in plain view.</P><P>In addition to trading, Glencore also owns Xstrata - the mining giant that played a key role in kyboshing the Mining Tax and which has attracted <A href=""http://www.smh.com.au/business/glencore-tax-bill-on-15b-income-zip-zilch-zero-20140626-3awg0.html"" target=""_self"" title="""">scathing criticism for its corporate tax policies</A> and the <A href=""http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/xstrata-cornered-by-tax-office-for-loading-local-debt/story-fnhi8df6-1226644840470"" target=""_self"" title="""">ire of the Australian Tax Office</A>.</P><P>With the world awash in raw materials and more production coming on stream, just as demand from China is cooling, Glencore is enduring a world of pain. If prices continue to fall, the company, according to some analysts, could fail.</P><P>It is almost the corporate equivalent of the Australian economy.</P><P>A fortnight ago, the company was forced to go cap in hand to shareholders for $US2.5 billion and has an array of assets up for sale in a bid to reduce debts.</P><P>Its Xstrata mining operations carry about $US30 billion in debt. But the trading operations at Glencore are thought to account for a further $US20 billion. Given at one stage last week, after its share price plunged 30 per cent in a day, it was worth just $US16 billion, it is skating on extraordinarily thin ice.</P><P>Those owed money have been desperately seeking an exit at almost any price as the cost of insuring against a Glencore default has skyrocketed in recent weeks.</P><P>Why would a Glencore collapse matter to Australia? For a start, it owns an array of mines from Mount Isa to the Hunter Valley and Kwinana in the west that employ thousands of miners.</P><P>To an extent, the future of those mines relies less on the fortunes of Xstrata than they do on commodity prices. If they are economic, another buyer will step in to run them even if the corporation collapses.</P><P>But it is the trading operations of Glencore that pose the greatest threat. As one of just three major commodities trading houses, a collapse will roil global commodities markets.</P><P>As the world discovered during the financial crisis, global trade ground to a halt because that most vital ingredient to any human interaction suddenly evaporated.</P><P>Trust.</P><P>Banks around the world refused to lend because they could not be certain of the extent to which other organisations were exposed to the toxic assets that caused the crisis. Despite all the laws demanding disclosure, all the regulatory bodies with oversight, no-one could determine exactly who was contaminated.</P><P>The crisis was resolved because of central bank intervention. But the major commodities traders like Glencore and Noble Group do not have that luxury. There is no lender of last resort, no organisation willing or able to prevent a failure.</P><P>And just like Lehman, no-one knows the full extent of the exposure or the way in which loosely regulated commodities trade financing intersects with the banking system.</P><P>In China, iron ore traders for years have been using stockpiles as collateral for loans from the shadow banking system.</P><P>The commodity price rout has seen funds flooding out of emerging economies in recent months, creating enormous ructions on currency markets and feeding doubts among global stock investors and at the US Federal Reserve.</P><P>So spooked are global investors that, for the first time in a quarter of a century, last week far more was invested into cash than either stocks or bonds.</P><P>October generally is a turbulent time for investors. The September 2008 Lehman collapse sparked chaos that threatened global capitalism.</P><P>The hoodoo continues.

				</DIV><DIV id=""middle""><DIV id=""content_main""><DIV class=""container""><DIV class=""maintext""><P>CrÃ©dit Agricole announced today at its annual general meeting in Lille that it is ending its multi-million euro funding for coal mining projects and companies. Less than seven months before the United Nations conference on <mark>climate change</mark> in Paris (COP 21), CrÃ©dit Agricole has become the second major bank in the worldÂ âÂ after Bank of America [1]Â âÂ to cut its funding for the coal mining sector. Friends of the Earth France and BankTrack have welcomed this step forward and now call on CrÃ©dit Agricole to deliver in full for the <mark>climate</mark> by signing the 'Paris Pledge' and thus end completely the bank's support to the coal industry.</P><P><STRONG>Lucie Pinson, private finance campaigner at Friends of the Earth France, commented:</STRONG></P><P>&quot;Following its recent commitment not to finance the Galilee Basin mining projects in Australia [2], CrÃ©dit Agricole now seems on track to establish itself as a leader in the financial sector when it comes to <mark>climate policy</mark>. The bank's response to our questioning today was certainly more convincing than the responses we've had from SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale [3] or BNP Paribas [4] at their recent AGMs.&quot;</P><P>&quot;By pulling out of coal mining, CrÃ©dit Agricole is acknowledging that we must leave 80% of our coal reserves in the ground if we're to keep global warming below 2Â°C.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Paul Corbit Brown, from the US organisation Keepers of the Mountains</STRONG> and present at the CrÃ©dit Agricole AGM today to ask the bank to decisively end its support for the barbaric mountaintop removal (MTR) coal mining technique used in the Appalachian mountains, said:</P><P>&quot;CrÃ©dit Agricole is going even further than Bank of America with its recent announcement that it will reduce but not end its investments in coal mining. Notable too is that CrÃ©dit Agricole's commitment covers much of its financial support, including finance for projects, for companies and underwriting services.&quot;</P><P>CrÃ©dit Agricole had previously announced in 2013 an end to its MTR financing, yet it had remained involved in the financing of the most active MTR companies via its underwriting services. [5]</P><P>While campaigners welcomed CrÃ©dit Agricole's announcement today, they also pointed out its limitations. One principal drawback is that the new CrÃ©dit Agricole policy applies only to companies that are focused specifically on coal extraction. Therefore the bank can continue to finance coal extraction via support for multi-nationals such as BHP Billiton, Glencore or Anglo American. A further caveat is that CrÃ©dit Agricole has announced nothing concerning its financing of coal power plant projects and producers of electricity derived from coal, a sector that the bank supported with more than 4.7 billion euros between 2005 and April 2014. [6]</P><P><STRONG>Thomas Mnguni, a South African</STRONG> who attended today's AGM to inform CrÃ©dit Agricole that coal is an obsolete energy form both in the north and the south, commented:</P><P>&quot;You can't talk about 'small support' or projects with 'minor impacts' when you talk about coal. Whether it's extraction or combustion in power plants, coal destroys the <mark>climate</mark> and the livelihoods of entire communities. In 2009, CrÃ©dit Agricole participated in the financing of the massive Medupi and Kusile coal plant projects in South Africa which have only reinforced inequality in the country. Today I asked CrÃ©dit Agricole to refrain from making the same mistake and to commit to not provide finance for new coal plants, in particular for the Thabametsi plant being developed by Engie in South Africa. Instead, as South Africa has one of the best potentials for renewable energy in the world, the bank should be supporting this sector's development.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Yann Louvel, BankTrack's <mark>Climate</mark> and Energy coordinator, said:</STRONG></P><P>&quot;After ten years of campaigning from Friends of the Earth France and BankTrack, we welcome this breakthrough from CrÃ©dit Agricole. We now call on the bank to go further by signing the Paris Pledge [7] and ending its support for the coal sector completely. This should start with CrÃ©dit Agricole pulling out of the Plomin C coal plant project in Croatia and extend to no future financing of any coal plant. The bank now has seven months to quit coal.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Notes for editors:</STRONG></P><P>1.Â <SPAN style=""font-size: 8pt;"">Bank of America announced on May 6 this year that its updated coal
policy now includes a commitment to reduce its lending to coal mining

In the same year it paid $4-billion in taxes and royalties to host governments.</P><DIV class=""article-advert-container""><DIV class=""article-advert-container-text"">Advertisement</DIV></DIV><P>As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, Glencore helps governments to achieve the UN bodyâs <mark>sustainable</mark> development goals, while also upholding the International Labour Organisation Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</P><P>In the comprehensive report, Glencore chairperson <STRONG>Tony Hayward</STRONG> notes that 2017 marks the publication by Glencore of its first 'modern slavery statement', which assesses the risks of slavery, servitude, forced and child labour and human trafficking within its operations and supply chains, and identifies the steps the company is taking to mitigate and eliminate these risks.</P><DIV class=""article-advert-container""><DIV class=""article-advert-container-text"">Advertisement</DIV></DIV><P>In his review, Glencore CEO <STRONG>Ivan Glasenberg </STRONG>expresses a strong determination to eliminate fatalities from the business through continued implementation of a culture of safety and effective operational controls. âIt is with great regret that we experienced nine fatalities during the year,â he states.</P><P>Each time the company suffers a fatality, the management of the operation concerned fliesÂ to the headquarters to meet with the members of the boardâs top-level Health, Safety, Environment and Community (HSEC)Â  committee, which includes Hayward, Glasenberg and board members <STRONG>Peter Coates </STRONG>and <STRONG>Patrice Merrin.</STRONG></P><P>Glencoreâs 2017 HSEC summit focused on sharing learnings on safety and management of catastrophic hazards facing its operations and insights from programmes conducted in the South Africa-focused ferroalloys business have been shared to further encourage employees to choose lifesaving behaviours.</P><P>In a telephone interview with <EM>Mining Weekly Online </EM>to mark the release of the report of the company that employs close to 146 000 people, Glencore head of <mark>sustainable</mark> development <STRONG>Anna Krutikov </STRONG>reiterated the company's commitment to employing locally wherever possible and also to sourcing products and services from local businesses, again wherever possible.</P><P>She also pointed out that Glencore looks to enhancing the infrastructure that it is required to build as a mining company, so that this infrastructure can also serve as a shared benefit to the communities around its operations.</P><P>As a member of the Plenary of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, the International Council on Mining and Metals, and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, Glencore engages in strategic outreach.</P><P>âWe live and breathe an open-door policy. From our CEO down, weâll meet with anybody who has a concern or an interest in the company, or some aspects of its operations,â said Krutikov.</P><P>Sustainability Report 2017 states that last year Glencore addressed 1 063 community complaints.</P><P>The company regularly hosts visits to its operations by government officials, civil society and community representatives. At group level, it meets with governments, nongovernmental organisations (NGOs), customers, investors and the media, âfirst of all to explain what we do and how we do it, and to answer any questions, but also to understand the evolving expectations landscape, and how to make sure that our practices continue to evolve in a way that meets those growing expectations&quot;, said Krutikov.</P><P><STRONG>LOCAL COMMUNITIES</STRONG></P><P>In interacting with many diverse communities around the world, the report states that Glencore actively seeks broad-based, ongoing support from local communities as part of its licence to operate. It engages with communities through regular dialogue and works closely with them to maximise the value the business creates for them.</P><P>Krutikov outlined that if, for example, the company needs to extend a road or to open up an airport, it takes steps to enable members of the local community to make shared use of that infrastructure, as well to give communities access to local markets or the workplace.</P><P>As part of that, local enterprises are backed and local people assisted in building up businesses, for which the company provides mentoring, offtake programmes and collaboration with other mining companies to promote the local businesses.</P><P>âThatâs something we do quite a lot in the Rustenburg area in South Africa, where we work with other mining companies in business centres that offer an opportunity for young entrepreneurs to develop their businesses,â Krutikov told <EM>Mining Weekly Online</EM>. Glencore mines chrome in the Rustenburg area, where it also has ferrochrome production facilities.</P><P>Also in South Africa, Glencoreâs substantial coal business offers training linked to needs identified within the mining industry and other non-mining portable skills in order to reduce dependency. During 2017, 106 community engineering learners received theoretical and practical training, 84 received driver education licence training, 49 attended training colleges to obtain a trade qualification, 31 received training in early childhood development and nine received training to work with children and adults with special needs.</P><P>One of the challenges the company is looking to overcome is a culture of dependency on the mining operations, which is pronounced in particularly Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where companies now in the Glencore group were previously run as quasi-State entities that tended to provide everything to the towns in which they were operating.</P><P>While addressing unrealistic expectations that the communities may have of mining operations, work is being done with them to develop opportunities to help them to be more sustainably autonomous so that as and when the mines close, which they inevitably will do, communities are resilient and are able to continue to thrive.</P><P>âA lot of it is easier said than done,â Krutikov noted in her interview with <EM>Mining Weekly Onlin</EM>e.</P><P>Glencore is working intensively with some of the communities around its Colombian operations on what the community aspires to be once the mine closes and how the community would like to play a part in a Colombia that overcomes its legacy of conflict.</P><P>âIf somebody asked me what I wanted to be in 30 years, I certainly would struggle for an answer. Working on that with an entire community is an enormous challenge but itâs also an incredible opportunity, and itâs something that weâre working on very hard,â she said.</P><P>In the Kolwezi area, where Glencore has its operations in the DRC, problematic artisanal mining activity is widespread, and a big part of the companyâs community programmes is to offer alternative livelihood opportunities through cooperatives to the people involved in artisanal mining activities, particularly women and children who find themselves driven to it.</P><P>âAgain, the focus is on helping those cooperatives to become autonomous. We start by having an offtake agreement, so we buy the produce. But weâre now in a position where those cooperatives are selling into the local market, local restaurants and they want to sell into the town.</P><P>âItâs fantastic that theyâre able to thrive and weâve got about 4Â 000 people in those cooperatives today. About half of them are women and also about half are former artisanal miners. That means theyâre able to put their kids through school, they're able to maintain their houses, theyâre able to have a life and they donât have to resort to this horrible activity of artisanal mining,â was Krutikov's comment to <EM>Mining Weekly Online</EM>. Â </P><P>Glencoreâs Katanga and Mutanda copper operations in the DRC are supporting holiday camps for school children and agricultural initiatives to deter the participation of children and women in artisanal mining.</P><P>Katanga and Mutanda work with local NGOs and churches to deliver the holiday camps. During June to August 2017, more than 7 200 children participated in theatre, drawing, music, scouts as well as discussions on the risks of artisanal mining and the importance of education.</P><P>Attendees received a meal each day, and at the end of the camps, ceremonies are attended by representatives from the local authorities and community leaders, to demonstrate the activities undertaken by the children and to award each child a school uniform.</P><P>To encourage greater attendance at the holiday camps, they are inter-linked with economic diversification projects delivered by local cooperatives. The projects include those focused on livestock farming, beekeeping, dairy farming and the production of jam, juices and flour, welding, carpentry and catering.</P><P>Glencoreâs Katanga copper operation in the DRC is working with local authorities to support and promote local employment and procurement through funding infrastructure improvement projects, while in the Kolwezi region, the local authorities are keen to develop small and medium-sized enterprises and see Katanga as a key player in the delivery of this ambition, the report states.</P><P>Katanga has undertaken consultation sessions with local communities that included representatives from civil society, including churches, NGOs, schools and youth movements, womenâs associations and agriculture cooperatives, to identify projects to develop local procurement and skills.</P><P>Following the consultation process, Katanga identified a number of projects including repairing schools, a community centre and hospital wards, building a health centre and drilling community wells. Katanga is employing local contractors and suppliers on all of the projects.</P><P>The Katanga and Mutanda operations last year provided training for 1 530 contractors and 148 employees, and a further 30 mine police participated in an information session. Mutanda also provides regular training to the regional police force.</P><P>Glencore has established a public-private partnership with the government on a $400-million commitment towards the refurbishment of the DRCâs power infrastructure. The completion of the work is due in early 2019. The project will align with a World Bank project to expand electricity access in unserved and poorly served areas. Its DRC assets are meeting their energy needs through power supply agreements with the national power corporation, SNEL, which delivers energy produced from hydroelectric sources.</P><P>In South Africa, all of Glencoreâs ferroalloys smelters meet the updated industry-specific sulphur dioxideemissions limits that will come into force in 2020. The Glencore vanadium smelter, Rhovan, has implemented improved measures, the impact of which are being tracked ahead of the regulatory deadline.</P><P><STRONG><mark>CLIMATE CHANGE</mark></STRONG></P><P>The group has set a target of reducing <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by at least 5% below the 2016 level of 35.3-million tonnes by 2020. This target reflects the work Glencore has undertaken to date on understanding its <mark>carbon</mark> footprint.</P><P>Through the inclusion of <mark>climate change</mark> considerations into the companyâs yearly planning process, its commodity departments have established energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) forecasts for each asset.</P><P>Additionally, departments are identifying, monitoring and delivering a portfolio of energy and GHG emission reduction opportunities for their assets.</P><P>In 2017, the group generated 33.5-million tonnes of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>) emissions, the 1.8-million tonnes decrease on 2016 being primarily due to lower coal seam emissions at the companyâs coal mines.</P><P>In Canada, the second wind turbine at the Raglan mine is under construction and should produce electricity for the first time in September. Raglanâs first wind turbine delivered savings of 2.2-million litres of diesel last year, a reduction of 6 250 t of GHG emissions and equivalent to taking 1 350 vehicles off the road</P><P>At Nordenham, Glencoreâs zinc plant in Germany, the recycling loop of materials in its alloying operations has been reduced, preventing the processing of the material throughout the whole plant. In addition, it installed advanced compressors that are reducing energy consumption. Together, these improvements are delivering <mark>carbon</mark> savings of 1 400 t of GHG emissions a year.</P><P>Oil production assets in Chad have begun to electrify their camps using waste gases as the energy source. The projected yearly <mark>carbon</mark> savings are 5 000 t of GHG.</P><P>Glencoreâs <mark>Carbon</mark> Transport and Storage Corporation's (CTSCo's) integrated Surat Basin <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage (CCS) project is a scalable demonstration project. Formed in 2010, CTSCo brings together the deep subsurface skills required to demonstrate the effective deployment of storage technology in Queenslandâs Surat Basin region. The study is delivering an integrated CCS project that incorporates capture at a coal power station, transportation and sequestration to establish a basis for permitting of long-term CO<SUB>2</SUB> storage in a suitable location in Queensland.</P><P>This study will provide a model to deliver a viable commercial approach to reducing CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions in Queensland and elsewhere in Australia, reducing Australiaâs overall <mark>carbon</mark> footprint and benefiting all emitters of CO<SUB>2</SUB> requiring storage, Glencoreâs Sustainability Report 2017 states.</P></DIV><P class=""sml"">

  issues</SPAN></A></LI></UL><DIV class=""standout""><H3>How does it affect you?</H3><UL><LI>'Takers', ie 'acquirers' of equity derivatives, 
        will need to review their positions in the market, and the circumstances 
        surrounding relevant companies, to determine whether their interests 
        (which is an aggregation of any long position held in the relevant 
        company pursuant to equity derivatives and physical holdings of the 
        company's securities) exceed 5 per cent and/or whether any 'control 
        transactions' have commenced. In certain circumstances, even an interest 
        in a company that is not the subject of a formal takeover bid may 
        generate a disclosure obligation.
        </LI><LI>Takers will need to consider whether their internal systems are 
        appropriately set-up to identify the target company and facilitate 
        timely disclosure of the information required to be disclosed. 
        </LI><LI>   Although the Takeovers Panel provides for a nominal 
        transitional period of six months from 11 April 2008, for any 
        applications considered during that period the Panel will take into 
        account any steps taken to minimise adverse effects of any 
        non-disclosure. In other words, the message from the Panel is to start 
        house-keeping efforts early.
        </LI><LI>'Market makers', ie providers of equity derivatives who hold an 
        Australian Financial Services Licence or equivalent, would generally not 
        be required to disclose their position as the primary disclosure 
        obligation relates to the 'taker'. This position does not apply, 
        however, if the market maker is associated or acting in concert with its 
        client in a control transaction. </LI></UL></DIV><H4><A name=""Backg"">Background</A></H4><P>Following a consultation period, the Takeovers Panel (the 
<B><I>Panel</I></B>) has finalised the position it adopted in 
September 2007 when it issued its draft guidance note â that the use of equity 
derivatives<SUP><A href=""#An_e"">1</A></SUP>, if undisclosed when certain conditions are met, may 
constitute grounds for a finding of 'unacceptable circumstances'. </P><P>The background to the enhanced regulatory position taken by the Panel is 
derived from concerns that potential bidders were utilising equity derivatives â 
essentially equity swaps, options, future contracts or contracts for difference 
â in a manner that had the potential to affect the market in the underlying 
securities (for example, by bringing about a reduction in the 'free float' of 
the company). This is on the basis that entering into a purely cash-settled 
contract, combined with the economic incentive of the writer to acquire 
securities in the underlying entity to hedge its risk, allows the holder to 'put 
its foot' on the underlying securities. This may affect supply (and possibly the 
price) of the securities and, in turn, affect:</P><UL><LI>the control or potential control of a company; and 
  </LI><LI>whether or not there is an efficient, competitive and informed market for 
  the control of the company's voting shares.</LI></UL><P>These issues came to the fore in the takeover bid launched by Centennial Coal 
for Austral. In that matter, the Panel found that <mark>Glencore International AG</mark>, 
which held equity derivatives of around 6.49 per cent (in addition to an 
existing physical holding of securities of approximately 7.42 per cent) had 
engaged in unacceptable circumstances by failing to disclose its position to the 
market.</P><P>The stance embodied in the Guidance Note broadly reflects a similar approach 
taken by the United Kingdom's Takeovers Panel in November 2005, when it directed 
that equity derivatives must be disclosed if they, when aggregated with any 
interest in the physical securities, exceed 1 per cent.</P><P>The final Guidance Note is considerably shorter than the draft guidance note 
and contains a number of substantive changes.</P><H4><A name=""Circu"">Circumstances when disclosure 
ought to be made</A></H4><P>The Guidance Note provides that the Panel expects that where a 
<B>control transaction</B> exists, all long positions<SUP><A href=""#The_h"">2</A></SUP> 
created via entry into an equity derivative that already exists, or which are 
created, ought to be disclosed unless they are under 5 per cent.</P><P>A control transaction is defined as a transaction that affects, or is likely 
to affect:</P><UL><LI>control or potential control of a company; or 
  </LI><LI>the acquisition or proposed acquisition of a substantial interest in a 
  company. </LI></UL><P>A control transaction is considered by the Panel to have 
<B>commenced</B> under paragraph 10 of the Guidance Note when:</P><OL style=""list-style-type:lower-alpha;""><LI>a proposal that is likely to affect control or potential control of a 
  company is announced; </LI><LI>an acquisition of a substantial interest occurs; 
  or</LI><LI>a proposed acquisition of a substantial interest is 
announced.</LI></OL><P>A<B> substantial</B><B>interest</B>, as used in paragraphs (b) and (c) 
above, is defined as a parcel of securities, of whatever size, that:</P><UL><LI>forms a step in the direction of takeover or change 
  in corporate control but not limited to: 
  </LI><LI>a relevant interest; or 
  </LI><LI>a legal or equitable interest; or 
  </LI><LI>a power or right in relation to the company or securities (see section 
  602A of the <I>Corporations Act 2001</I> (Cth)). </LI></UL><P>The Guidance Note also cites Justice Emmett in <I>Brierley Investments Ltd 
and Others v Australian Securities Commission and 
Others</I><SUP><A href=""#24_AC"">3</A></SUP> for the view that 3 per cent of the voting shares 
in a company could constitute a substantial interest.</P><P>Non-disclosure of a short derivative position by the taker may give rise to 
unacceptable circumstances if the taker's long position exceeds 5 per cent and 
the short derivative position affects the total position.</P><H5>Commentary</H5><P>The draft guidance note had originally proposed that disclosure of all 
derivative transactions above the notional 5 per cent ought to be made â a 
replication of the existing position with respect to physical securities. The 
inclusion of a 'control transaction' concept as a qualifier to disclosure might 
be seen as a response to a number of submissions made during the consultation 
period that disclosure should be so limited. </P><P>   However, the manner in which 'control transactions' are 
said to have commenced introduces some uncertainty for market participants. 
In particular, when a particular action or event can be said to 'form a step in 
the direction of takeover or change in corporate control' (as an indicator of 
a substantial interest) will necessitate a judgment. This position might 
be contrasted with the UK position where the disclosure (albeit of 1 per 
cent interests) of equity derivatives is only required in an offer period 
in connection with offeree companies listed on the UK Takeover Panel's website 
at the relevant time. The Australian Panel's position shifts the onus 
for determining whether such an event or step has occurred to the disclosing entity and 
impliedly assumes that they will have in place systems for doing this, ie 
sufficient media and market monitoring to determine how companies in which they 
have significant long positions are affected.</P><H4><A name=""Posit"">Position of market makers</A></H4><P>The Panel provides certain carve-outs for market makers where they have 
assumed a role as writer in a disinterested, professional capacity. The Panel 
takes the view that non-disclosure of equity derivative positions by a market 
maker is unlikely to give rise to unacceptable circumstances if each of the 
following apply:</P><UL><LI>the equity derivative is written at arm's length; 
  </LI><LI>the equity derivative is written for a non-associate 
  or one with whom the writer is not acting in concert in relation to the 
  affairs of the relevant company; and 
  </LI><LI>the market maker is not acting for the client in a corporate advisory 
  capacity, or if there is an effective Chinese wall in place between the 
  different divisions.</LI></UL><P>The Guidance Note provides that a market maker who seeks to hedge its risk 
via entry into a back-to-back equity derivative as taker will be treated in 
those circumstances as if it were a writer.</P><H5>Commentary</H5><P>For the most part, market makers should be relieved of an obligation to 
disclose as this burden will fall on the writer.</P><P>Clearly, investment banks engaged by prospective bidders will not be able to 
assist their clients in acquiring a pre-bid stake greater than 5 per cent via 
utilisation of equity derivatives (derived by aggregating any physical 
securities in the company held by the client and the bank), unless entry into 
the transaction by the bank is unrelated and it is prepared to expose the 
integrity of its Chinese walls to scrutiny by the Panel. </P><P>For bona fide market makers, the Panel has sought to provide some reassurance 
that it will take into account when framing orders that certain orders it could 
make if 'unacceptable circumstances' were found to exist, such as declaring a 
long equity derivative void, could leave the writer exposed to market risks.</P></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

With moves in the global legal and regulatory space seemingly coming fast and furious recently for resource companies.</P><P>And this week the action hit a frantic pace. With five big moves happening in mining policy, which all investors and project developers should be watching closely.</P><P>Letâs count âem down.</P><P>The most high-profile news once again came in the Philippines. Where anti-mining policy from the new federal government hit further heights â when the mines minister effectively quashed one of the biggest copper-gold development projects on Earth.</P><P>Thatâs the Tampakan deposit. A 2.9 billion tonne orebody developed by Glencore, before that firm exited the project last year over regulatory frustrations.</P><P>And the news didnât get any better this week for the now-local owners of Tampakan. When mines minister Gina Lopez publicly declared that she will not allow the deposit to be developed by open-pit methods. A move that likely precludes any kind of major operationÂ here.</P><P>Elsewhere in the Philippines, the new government also stepped up moves against mining. Announcing that a total of seven mines have now been closed on environmental reviews â with a further 23 nickel mines now coming up for similar appraisal.</P><P>Nearby in Indonesia, things also got tense between miners and government. When federal officials offered Freeport-McMoRan a lowball $640 million for a 10.64% stake in the Grasberg mine.</P><P>Freeport is required to sell the stake to the government, but has said the interestÂ is worth $1.7 billion. Setting up for some tense negotiations here going forward.</P><P>Then we jump over to Chile. Where major gold producer Kinross Gold said this week it is shutting down its Maricunga mine â pending the outcome of a government review into water use at the mine. With federal officials here seeking to shut down water withdrawals at the operation, a move Kinross says would preclude mining.</P><P>Finally we end in Canada. Where a federal minister sided with regulators in the territory of Nunavut in denying a permit for Arevaâs proposed Kiggavik uranium mine. A development the uranium major had been pushing â but which officials said cannot proceed because the company hasnât specified a start date for the project.</P><P>Lots going on, lots to keep tabs on. Watch especially in the Philippines for further upward momentum in nickel prices if the above-mentioned reviews lead to more mine shutdowns.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV><H1>July 29th</H1><P>Article by:Â <B><A href=""http://info.scoop.co.nz/Greenpeace"">Greenpeace</A></B></P><P><STRONG>Worldâs largest <mark>carbon</mark> producers ordered to respond to allegations of human rights abuses from <mark>climate change</mark></STRONG></P><P>Manila, 27 July 2016 â Companies responsible for the majority of fossil fuel products that have been manufactured, marketed, and sold since the industrial revolution and have contributed the lionâs share of cumulative global emissions of industrial <mark>CO2</mark> and methane, have been ordered to respond to a legal petition that triggered the first-ever national human rights investigation concerning <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>The Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines (CHR) today sent copies of the complaint (1) filed by the Petitioners, including disaster survivors, community organisations and Greenpeace Southeast Asia,(2) as well as an official order,(3) to the headquarters of the worldâs largest investor-owned fossil fuel and cement producers. The order enjoins the companies to submit answers to the Commission within 45 days.</P><P>The 47 companies that were sent the petition and the order to respond to allegations of human rights abuses resulting from <mark>climate change</mark> include Chevron, ExxonMobil, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Total, BHP Billiton, Glencore, Suncor and ConocoPhillips.</P><P>âWeâve been affected for so long by storms, droughtsâ¦by extreme weather, now made worse by <mark>climate change</mark>. We just want to live a decent and peaceful life, without fear and being at the mercy of big corporations that only care for their profits. Our only choice is to defend our rights. We want those most responsible to be held accountable. We want justice and to regain the ability to protect the little that we have left for our childrenâ, said Veronica âDerekâ Cabe, one of the petitioners from Bataan, where communities are fighting against coal storage facilities and proposals for a new coal-fired power plant and where one of the community leaders advocating against coal was shot dead on 1 July 2016. (4)</P><P>The Commission launched a probe in 2015 looking into whether the worldâs largest <mark>carbon</mark> producers (5) are violating or threatening to violate the human rights of all Filipinos by significantly contributing to global <mark>climate change</mark> and failing to reduce emissions, despite having the capacity to do so.</P><P>The Petitioners have asked the Commission, among other things, to require the companies to submit plans on the steps they will take to eliminate, remedy and prevent the devastating effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, in a country known to be one of the worldâs most vulnerable to these effects. The complaint also asks the Commission to monitor people and communities acutely vulnerable to the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>âUltimately, those who have profited most from pumping <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide into the atmosphere must bear the burden of preventing the havoc already being wreaked by <mark>climate change</mark>. This is the first step in that process. The courageous Filipino people are the first to put the worldâs largest <mark>carbon</mark> producers on notice that they must account for their emissions,â said Jennifer Morgan, Executive Director of Greenpeace International.â</P><P>The Commissionâs actions are unprecedented. For the first time, a national human rights body is officially taking steps to address the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on human rights and the responsibility of private actors. After the company responses are received, the Petitioners anticipate hearings will commence in the Philippines in October 2016.</P><P>The Petitioners are calling the companiesâ business plans into question and asking governments around the world to keep fossil fuels in the ground. This is another signal to the fossil fuel producers from people that they cannot continue business as usual.</P><P>There is a growing global <mark>climate</mark> justice movement working to strengthen the capacity of people around the world to take action inside and outside the courts.</P><H1>July 28th</H1><HEADER class=""article-header ng-scope""><DIV class=""header-meta-wrapper ng-scope""><P>Article by:Â <A class=""link ng-binding"" href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/judeclemente/"" target=""_self"">Jude Clemente</A></P><P>To those of you that sell oil, coal, and natural gas: keep swinging.

The mineralâs 48-per-cent jump this year is more than double crude oilâs advance.</P><P class=""selectionShareable"">Coal-fired power generation in China, the biggest consumer, is forecast to fall 3.5 per cent this year just as supplies to Europe from the United States, Indonesia, Colombia and Russia rebound, according to energy consultants Perret Associates. In the European Union, new <mark>climate</mark>-protection policies will contribute to a 14-per-cent fall in coal demand in the seven years through 2020, International Energy Agency forecasts show. âThis rally is seriously overdone,â said Thomas Pugh, an analyst at Capital Economics in London, who expects coal for next year to drop to about $50 (U.S.) a tonne, or about 18 per cent below current rates. âThe market should realize that demand is still very, very poor.â</P><P class=""selectionShareable"">Coal for northwestern Europe in 2017 climbed to $61.60 a tonne earlier this month, the highest for a benchmark contract since March last year, according to ICE Futures Europe in London. Itâs poised for a fifth monthly increase, the longest run of gains in six years, and is outpacing the returns on commodity futures from natural gas to copper and corn.</P><P class=""selectionShareable"">Prices were helped this year by heavy rains that reduced shipments from Indonesia, the worldâs second-biggest coal exporter, and mining curbs in China that prompted demand for imports.</P><P class=""selectionShareable"">By the end of 2016, year-ahead coal will fall to $54 a tonne from the $60 range this week, according to the median estimate of seven traders and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The range of responses was $45 to $60.</P><P class=""selectionShareable"">The Newcastle thermal coal price, a benchmark in Asia, may average $58 a tonne next year, Citigroup Inc. analysts including Clarke Wilkins wrote in a July 25 report.</P><P class=""selectionShareable"">In Europe, coalâs jump followed a 63-per-cent drop over the previous five years, a spiral that saw it slump to a rescord $36.50 in February. Analysts arenât forecasting a repeat of that plunge, which came amid âextreme pessimismâ over falling demand in China and speculation that oil would decline to $20 a barrel, less than half the current price, said Andreas Speer, a commodity analyst at Bayerische Landesbank in Munich.</P><P class=""selectionShareable"">Trading is surging even after institutions including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. pledged to scale back support for coal projects in a bid to reduce the <mark>pollution</mark> blamed for global warming. European coal-trading volume in June jumped 89 per cent from a year earlier, according to Trayport Ltd., a London-based financial information provider.</P><P class=""selectionShareable"">âThe production figures in China and Indonesia were coming down and buyers decided to jump into the market,â Mr. Speer said.</P><P class=""selectionShareable"">In an effort to improve its environment, China curbed industrial production and cut its coal-mining output by 9.7 per cent in the six months through June, with production tumbling 17 per cent in that month alone from a year earlier. Indonesian coal exports dropped 32 per cent in the first half, the countryâs Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry data show.</P><P class=""selectionShareable"">âWe were taken by surprise by the scale of the gain,â said Guillaume Perret, director of Perret Associates. âThe market overshot on the way down and now itâs probably overshooting on the way up.â</P><H1>July 27th</H1><P>Article by:Â <A class=""tone-colour"" href=""https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paul-farrell"" rel=""author"" data-link-name=""auto tag link"">Paul Farrell</A></P><P>The newly privatised Port of Newcastle has launched a federal court appeal in Australia against the mining giant Glencore to maintain control over port access fees that is likely to focus further attention on the privatisation of government assets across Australia.</P><P>The appeal coincides with <A class=""u-underline"" draggable=""true"" href=""https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/27/acccs-rod-sims-says-privatisations-severely-damaging-economy"" data-link-name=""in body link"">stinging criticism of successive Australian governmentsâ privatisation of government assets </A>by the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Rod Sims.</P><P>Sims, who has long been publicly supportive of privatisation in general, warned on Wednesday that privatisation was âseverely damagingâ the Australian economy and he singled out ports and vocational education .</P><ASIDE class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--upgraded"" data-component=""rich-link"" data-link-name=""rich-link-2 | 1""><DIV class=""rich-link tone-news--item ""><DIV class=""rich-link__container""><DIV class=""rich-link__header""><H1 class=""rich-link__title""><A class=""rich-link__link"">ACCCâs Rod Sims says privatisations âseverely damagingâ economy</A></H1></DIV></DIV></DIV></ASIDE><P>The Port of Newcastle was privatised by the <A class=""u-underline"" href=""https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"">New South Wales</A> government in 2014 as part of a joint venture between Hastings Fund Management and China Merchants.</P><P>The venture quickly increased port fees by between 40% and 60% for vessels to access the shipping channel, sparking an approach to the federal government from Glencore to seek to have the monopoly access of the port more heavily regulated.</P><P>When that approach was rejected, it appealed to the Australian Competition Tribunal, which ruled in its favour.

The most recent financial year saw a 28% decline in ore grade. To prevent a decrease in production, BHP must extract a full one-third more material for the same amount of copper concentrate. That ore becomes deeper and harder to extract each year. Costs have managed to sit around the $1.00/lb mark only through significant capital spending, and a bear cycle that has seen the price for services plummet.</P><P class=""p p2"">Ore grades will continue to decline, and with much of the worldâs copper uneconomic at current prices, the marginal pound of copper will set the price in the long run.

to Dan Gertler, a controversial businessman accused of bribing senior officials
in Democratic Republic of Congo to advance his mining interests, Global Witness
revealed today. These payments were due to be paid to Congoâs state mining
company GÃ©camines under the terms of the original contract it had with Glencore.
</P><P>Glencore did not disclose in company filings that it was
instead making these payments to Gertler, a known corruption risk. That he was
the recipient of the payments comes to light only weeks after Glencore bought
Gertler out of mining assets it held jointly with him in Congo in a billion
dollar deal.</P><P>A Global Witness investigation found that from 2013 to 2016 Toronto-listed
Katanga Mining, majority-owned by Glencore, made âsignature bonusâ and other
payments totalling over $75 million to Dan Gertlerâs Africa Horizons company,
registered in the Cayman Islands. Under the original contract these payments
would have gone to GÃ©camines, but Global Witness wrote to Glencore after
reviewing company documents and filings that raised questions over the true recipient
of the payments. Glencore admitted that they were made to Gertlerâs company.</P><P>âItâs outrageous that Glencore has been making payments to a
friend of the Congolese President who has been accused of bribery and
corruption, and then not telling its shareholders or the public that itâs done
so,â said Pete Jones from the Congo team at Global Witness. âGlencore has been
in business in Congo with Gertler for a decade and has known about the
allegations that have been made against him for years.â</P><P>Gertler is a close friend of Congoâs President Joseph Kabila
and has been a focus of major foreign bribery investigations in the US and UK.
In <A href=""https://www.globalwitness.org/en/press-releases/fine-hedge-fund-bribery-major-step-forward-corruption-fight/"">a
finding by US authorities in September</A> against the hedge fund Och-Ziff, an
âinfamous Israeli businessmanâ was identified as having paid bribes to
Congolese officials to win mining licences for Och-Ziff. The businessman is
widely understood to be Gertler. He is <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-05/sfo-probes-israeli-billionaire-ex-enrc-directors-on-congo-deals"">reported
to be a central focus of a corruption investigation by the UKâs Serious Fraud
Office</A> into Kazakh mining company ENRC, based in part on ENRCâs deals with
Gertler in Congo. Gertlerâs spokesman told Bloomberg that his company âvigorously
contests any and all accusations of wrongdoing in any of its dealings in
[Congo]â.</P><P>Congo has vast natural resource wealth, but corruption, mismanagement
and the sale of mines below market value have helped keep it one of the worldâs
poorest countries, consistently languishing near the bottom of the UN Human
Development Index.</P><P>Glencoreâs Katanga Miningâs company filings to the Toronto
Stock Exchange for 2013 indicated that royalty and signature bonus payments were
âpayable to GÃ©caminesâ. In subsequent filings, the words âpayable to GÃ©caminesâ
were omitted and no new recipient was named. Glencore declared the 2013 and
2014 payments it had made to Gertlerâs company as payments to GÃ©camines, in its
submissions to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).Glencore
has now admitted, in a letter to Global Witness, that these payments actually
went to Gertler from 2013 to 2016.</P><P>âThe discrepancy between Katanga Miningâs filings and the
real recipient of these huge payments runs the risk of misleading investors.
Gertler is a well-known corruption risk in Congoâs mining sector and GÃ©camines
is famously opaque. Investors need to ask Glencore why it felt comfortable
making these payments and why it didnât clearly disclose Gertler as the
recipient,â said Jones.</P><P>Global Witness <A href=""https://www.globalwitness.org/en/press-releases/congo-signs-over-potential-880m-royalties-glencore-project-offshore-company-belonging-friend-congolese-president/"">previously
reported in November 2016</A> that since 2014 Glencore had made royalty payments,
originally due to go to Congoâs state mining company, GÃ©camines, to Gertlerâs
Africa Horizons company instead.Â  Glencore
has now confirmed that it has in fact been making those royalties payments
since 2013, as well as making signature bonus payments to Gertler instead of GÃ©camines
for the same period.Â Glencore and Gertlerâs representatives said in November that
GÃ©camines had sold the rights to these royalties to Africa Horizons but they
have not provided any details on the terms of the deal, nor have they said if
the signature bonuses were part of this transaction.</P><P>In February 2017 Glencore announced that it had bought
Gertler out of the two mining assets they joint-owned in Congo, the copper mine
owned by Katanga Mining and the Mutanda mine. Despite buying Gertler out of
these assets Glencore will continue to make royalty payments to Gertler on both
projects, according to Glencore.</P><P>The redirection of royalty and signature bonus payments from
GÃ©camines to Gertler was identifiable in large part thanks to the data in the
2014 Congo report by the EITI, which publishes mining, oil and gas company
payments to states and state-owned companies. It is vital that such disclosure
mechanisms become and remain law. It is extremely disappointing that <A href=""https://www.globalwitness.org/en/press-releases/us-congress-votes-corruption-overturning-historic-transparency-law-gift-big-oil/"">the
Trump administration has chosen to overturn payment reporting</A> rules for US
companies within its first month in the White House.</P><P>The broader importance of a system that legally requires
company payment disclosures was underlined by an experienced equities analyst
speaking to Global Witness:Â  âCompanies
do not issue press releases when they get
involved in underhand activities. Rather, such conduct is often
slowly exposed through incremental information contained in public
disclosures.â</P><P>Glencore has long been aware of the corruption risks related
to its partnership with Gertler. Global Witness published a memo <A href=""https://www.globalwitness.org/documents/17969/DRC-GW_secret_sales_memo_May_9_2012_ENG.pdf"">to
Glencore and its shareholders</A> as early as 2012 â before any of the
signature bonus or royalty payments revealed here were made â to outline the ârisks of corruptionâ
associated with Gertler, after Glencore had struck opaque mining deals with
him.</P><P><A href=""https://www.globalwitness.org/documents/18788/Glencore_Response_to_Global_Witness.pdf"">Glencore said it had âcomplied with its disclosure obligationsâ</A> under Canadian securities law and the rules governing the Toronto
Stock Exchange. It said it had declared the payments to Gertlerâs company as
payments to Gecamines in its EITI submission âbecause the payments discharged
KCCâs [Kamoto Copper Company - the mining project in Congo] obligations to make these payments to Gecaminesâ. In response to
questions from Global Witness in November, Glencore said that it was satisfied
that there was an underlying basis for the assignment of royalty rights from
Gecamines to Gertler.</P><P>Fleuretteâs spokesperson at Powerscourt public relations
firm did not provide a comment by the deadline, despite being granted an
extension of time to respond. In the past Fleurette has denied any wrongdoing
in its Congo deals. In November Fleurette said that what it had received was
âfar less than the amount â¦ paid for the royaltiesâ and that it âwill have
suffered a huge loss as a resultâ.</P><P>None of the parties involved has revealed what, if anything,
Fleurette paid for the Gecamines royalties stream in KCC. Global Witness calls
on Fleurette and Glencore to reveal the underlying basis for the royalties

                  The communities most in need of regional  strategies are often those without the resources to develop business plans,  investment strategies, efficient and affordable supply chains and cost benefit  analyses. Yet, USDA research shows that  money spent on food produced locally tends to stay and circulate in the  community, expanding the potential for job creation and spurring economic  growth. How can a community develop  local and regional food systems and acquire the tools and resources to turn  disadvantages into benefits?<STRONG><EM>Speaker: </EM></STRONG><EM>Malini Ram  Moraghan, Managing Director, Wholesome Wave Investments,

                  Bees are  by far the most important pollinators, from the plant and crop production point  of view. The main reason is that they collect pollen to feed their young,  unlike butterflies, moths, flies, beetles, etc. So they have to visit enough  flowers to collect enough pollen to feed an entire nest, and they have evolved  specially designed structures and hairs for this purpose. There are an  estimated 3,700-4,000 species of bees native to North America, in addition to  the more commonly known honeybee. With the rise of issues such as Colony  Collapse Disorder, bee and pollinator health has become a crucial issue for  agriculture. <STRONG><EM>Moderator: </EM></STRONG><EM> Robyn Rose, National Policy  Manager, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA, Riverdale, MD<STRONG>Â </STRONG></EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

In the same year it paid $4-billion in taxes and royalties to host governments.</P><DIV class=""article-advert-container""><DIV class=""article-advert-container-text"">Advertisement</DIV></DIV><P>As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, Glencore helps governments to achieve the UN bodyâs <mark>sustainable</mark> development goals, while also upholding the International Labour Organisation Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</P><P>In the comprehensive report, Glencore chairperson <STRONG>Tony Hayward</STRONG> notes that 2017 marks the publication by Glencore of its first 'modern slavery statement', which assesses the risks of slavery, servitude, forced and child labour and human trafficking within its operations and supply chains, and identifies the steps the company is taking to mitigate and eliminate these risks.</P><DIV class=""article-advert-container""><DIV class=""article-advert-container-text"">Advertisement</DIV></DIV><P>In his review, Glencore CEO <STRONG>Ivan Glasenberg </STRONG>expresses a strong determination to eliminate fatalities from the business through continued implementation of a culture of safety and effective operational controls. âIt is with great regret that we experienced nine fatalities during the year,â he states.</P><P>Each time the company suffers a fatality, the management of the operation concerned fliesÂ to the headquarters to meet with the members of the boardâs top-level Health, Safety, Environment and Community (HSEC)Â  committee, which includes Hayward, Glasenberg and board members <STRONG>Peter Coates </STRONG>and <STRONG>Patrice Merrin.</STRONG></P><P>Glencoreâs 2017 HSEC summit focused on sharing learnings on safety and management of catastrophic hazards facing its operations and insights from programmes conducted in the South Africa-focused ferroalloys business have been shared to further encourage employees to choose lifesaving behaviours.</P><P>In a telephone interview with <EM>Mining Weekly Online </EM>to mark the release of the report of the company that employs close to 146 000 people, Glencore head of <mark>sustainable</mark> development <STRONG>Anna Krutikov </STRONG>reiterated the company's commitment to employing locally wherever possible and also to sourcing products and services from local businesses, again wherever possible.</P><P>She also pointed out that Glencore looks to enhancing the infrastructure that it is required to build as a mining company, so that this infrastructure can also serve as a shared benefit to the communities around its operations.</P><P>As a member of the Plenary of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, the International Council on Mining and Metals, and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, Glencore engages in strategic outreach.</P><P>âWe live and breathe an open-door policy. From our CEO down, weâll meet with anybody who has a concern or an interest in the company, or some aspects of its operations,â said Krutikov.</P><P>Sustainability Report 2017 states that last year Glencore addressed 1 063 community complaints.</P><P>The company regularly hosts visits to its operations by government officials, civil society and community representatives. At group level, it meets with governments, nongovernmental organisations (NGOs), customers, investors and the media, âfirst of all to explain what we do and how we do it, and to answer any questions, but also to understand the evolving expectations landscape, and how to make sure that our practices continue to evolve in a way that meets those growing expectations&quot;, said Krutikov.</P><P><STRONG>LOCAL COMMUNITIES</STRONG></P><P>In interacting with many diverse communities around the world, the report states that Glencore actively seeks broad-based, ongoing support from local communities as part of its licence to operate. It engages with communities through regular dialogue and works closely with them to maximise the value the business creates for them.</P><P>Krutikov outlined that if, for example, the company needs to extend a road or to open up an airport, it takes steps to enable members of the local community to make shared use of that infrastructure, as well to give communities access to local markets or the workplace.</P><P>As part of that, local enterprises are backed and local people assisted in building up businesses, for which the company provides mentoring, offtake programmes and collaboration with other mining companies to promote the local businesses.</P><P>âThatâs something we do quite a lot in the Rustenburg area in South Africa, where we work with other mining companies in business centres that offer an opportunity for young entrepreneurs to develop their businesses,â Krutikov told <EM>Mining Weekly Online</EM>. Glencore mines chrome in the Rustenburg area, where it also has ferrochrome production facilities.</P><P>Also in South Africa, Glencoreâs substantial coal business offers training linked to needs identified within the mining industry and other non-mining portable skills in order to reduce dependency. During 2017, 106 community engineering learners received theoretical and practical training, 84 received driver education licence training, 49 attended training colleges to obtain a trade qualification, 31 received training in early childhood development and nine received training to work with children and adults with special needs.</P><P>One of the challenges the company is looking to overcome is a culture of dependency on the mining operations, which is pronounced in particularly Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where companies now in the Glencore group were previously run as quasi-State entities that tended to provide everything to the towns in which they were operating.</P><P>While addressing unrealistic expectations that the communities may have of mining operations, work is being done with them to develop opportunities to help them to be more sustainably autonomous so that as and when the mines close, which they inevitably will do, communities are resilient and are able to continue to thrive.</P><P>âA lot of it is easier said than done,â Krutikov noted in her interview with <EM>Mining Weekly Onlin</EM>e.</P><P>Glencore is working intensively with some of the communities around its Colombian operations on what the community aspires to be once the mine closes and how the community would like to play a part in a Colombia that overcomes its legacy of conflict.</P><P>âIf somebody asked me what I wanted to be in 30 years, I certainly would struggle for an answer. Working on that with an entire community is an enormous challenge but itâs also an incredible opportunity, and itâs something that weâre working on very hard,â she said.</P><P>In the Kolwezi area, where Glencore has its operations in the DRC, problematic artisanal mining activity is widespread, and a big part of the companyâs community programmes is to offer alternative livelihood opportunities through cooperatives to the people involved in artisanal mining activities, particularly women and children who find themselves driven to it.</P><P>âAgain, the focus is on helping those cooperatives to become autonomous. We start by having an offtake agreement, so we buy the produce. But weâre now in a position where those cooperatives are selling into the local market, local restaurants and they want to sell into the town.</P><P>âItâs fantastic that theyâre able to thrive and weâve got about 4Â 000 people in those cooperatives today. About half of them are women and also about half are former artisanal miners. That means theyâre able to put their kids through school, they're able to maintain their houses, theyâre able to have a life and they donât have to resort to this horrible activity of artisanal mining,â was Krutikov's comment to <EM>Mining Weekly Online</EM>. Â </P><P>Glencoreâs Katanga and Mutanda copper operations in the DRC are supporting holiday camps for school children and agricultural initiatives to deter the participation of children and women in artisanal mining.</P><P>Katanga and Mutanda work with local NGOs and churches to deliver the holiday camps. During June to August 2017, more than 7 200 children participated in theatre, drawing, music, scouts as well as discussions on the risks of artisanal mining and the importance of education.</P><P>Attendees received a meal each day, and at the end of the camps, ceremonies are attended by representatives from the local authorities and community leaders, to demonstrate the activities undertaken by the children and to award each child a school uniform.</P><P>To encourage greater attendance at the holiday camps, they are inter-linked with economic diversification projects delivered by local cooperatives. The projects include those focused on livestock farming, beekeeping, dairy farming and the production of jam, juices and flour, welding, carpentry and catering.</P><P>Glencoreâs Katanga copper operation in the DRC is working with local authorities to support and promote local employment and procurement through funding infrastructure improvement projects, while in the Kolwezi region, the local authorities are keen to develop small and medium-sized enterprises and see Katanga as a key player in the delivery of this ambition, the report states.</P><P>Katanga has undertaken consultation sessions with local communities that included representatives from civil society, including churches, NGOs, schools and youth movements, womenâs associations and agriculture cooperatives, to identify projects to develop local procurement and skills.</P><P>Following the consultation process, Katanga identified a number of projects including repairing schools, a community centre and hospital wards, building a health centre and drilling community wells. Katanga is employing local contractors and suppliers on all of the projects.</P><P>The Katanga and Mutanda operations last year provided training for 1 530 contractors and 148 employees, and a further 30 mine police participated in an information session. Mutanda also provides regular training to the regional police force.</P><P>Glencore has established a public-private partnership with the government on a $400-million commitment towards the refurbishment of the DRCâs power infrastructure. The completion of the work is due in early 2019. The project will align with a World Bank project to expand electricity access in unserved and poorly served areas. Its DRC assets are meeting their energy needs through power supply agreements with the national power corporation, SNEL, which delivers energy produced from hydroelectric sources.</P><P>In South Africa, all of Glencoreâs ferroalloys smelters meet the updated industry-specific sulphur dioxideemissions limits that will come into force in 2020. The Glencore vanadium smelter, Rhovan, has implemented improved measures, the impact of which are being tracked ahead of the regulatory deadline.</P><P><STRONG><mark>CLIMATE CHANGE</mark></STRONG></P><P>The group has set a target of reducing <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by at least 5% below the 2016 level of 35.3-million tonnes by 2020. This target reflects the work Glencore has undertaken to date on understanding its <mark>carbon</mark> footprint.</P><P>Through the inclusion of <mark>climate change</mark> considerations into the companyâs yearly planning process, its commodity departments have established energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) forecasts for each asset.</P><P>Additionally, departments are identifying, monitoring and delivering a portfolio of energy and GHG emission reduction opportunities for their assets.</P><P>In 2017, the group generated 33.5-million tonnes of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>) emissions, the 1.8-million tonnes decrease on 2016 being primarily due to lower coal seam emissions at the companyâs coal mines.</P><P>In Canada, the second wind turbine at the Raglan mine is under construction and should produce electricity for the first time in September. Raglanâs first wind turbine delivered savings of 2.2-million litres of diesel last year, a reduction of 6 250 t of GHG emissions and equivalent to taking 1 350 vehicles off the road</P><P>At Nordenham, Glencoreâs zinc plant in Germany, the recycling loop of materials in its alloying operations has been reduced, preventing the processing of the material throughout the whole plant. In addition, it installed advanced compressors that are reducing energy consumption. Together, these improvements are delivering <mark>carbon</mark> savings of 1 400 t of GHG emissions a year.</P><P>Oil production assets in Chad have begun to electrify their camps using waste gases as the energy source. The projected yearly <mark>carbon</mark> savings are 5 000 t of GHG.</P><P>Glencoreâs <mark>Carbon</mark> Transport and Storage Corporation's (CTSCo's) integrated Surat Basin <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage (CCS) project is a scalable demonstration project. Formed in 2010, CTSCo brings together the deep subsurface skills required to demonstrate the effective deployment of storage technology in Queenslandâs Surat Basin region. The study is delivering an integrated CCS project that incorporates capture at a coal power station, transportation and sequestration to establish a basis for permitting of long-term CO<SUB>2</SUB> storage in a suitable location in Queensland.</P><P>This study will provide a model to deliver a viable commercial approach to reducing CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions in Queensland and elsewhere in Australia, reducing Australiaâs overall <mark>carbon</mark> footprint and benefiting all emitters of CO<SUB>2</SUB> requiring storage, Glencoreâs Sustainability Report 2017 states.</P></DIV><P class=""sml"">

</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></HEADER><DIV class=""content__article-body from-content-api js-article__body"" itemprop=""articleBody"" data-test-id=""article-review-body""><P>Mining and commodities giant <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/glencore"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Glencore</A> has suffered dozens of fatalities and been subject to six-figure fines for environmental breaches, the company revealed on Wednesday.</P><P>Glencore and its majority-owned operations suffered 56 fatalities in the 2008-10 period covered by its corporate responsibility report. It is the first such report produced by the company, even though they are standard in the sector. The company pledged to start publishing such information as part of <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/apr/14/glencore-story-float"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">its plans to list in April earlier this year</A>, in what was the biggest listing for some time on the London Stock Exchange.</P><P>Although the company is one of the biggest in its sector, and the world â with a market capitalisation on flotation of $60bn â Glencore paid only $2m in tax last year on European revenues of more than $1bn.</P><P>However, shares in the company, whose interests run from mining and energy to farming, have performed poorly since their debut, amid turmoil in the markets in the last few months and a flight to safe havens by investors.</P><P>Glencore's health and safety record takes up six pages in its 106-page report. But mining expert Roger Moody, of the <A href=""http://londonminingnetwork.org/"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">London Mining Network</A>, a group of non-governmental organisations concerned with the impacts of mining companies, said the company's record put it well below the sector leaders in safety terms. &quot;These numbers of fatalities are not the most egregious we've seen â in recent years, that has been from Vedanta, and that is a significantly smaller company. But that is in no way to minimise these fatalities â what they show is that Glencore is one of the most dangerous mining companies listed in London, when you compare it with others in the sector.&quot;</P><P>Moody pointed to Vedanta, the London-listed mining company with large Indian interests, whose operations have come under heavy fire from protesters, as among the worst, with 41 workers dying in a single incident in September 2009. Glencore's report does not contain detailed targets on future performance, but the company said these would be included next year.</P><P>Michael Fahrbach, head of sustainability at Glencore, said: &quot;We are concerned about the figures because there's nothing more important than achieving no fatalities in your operations. It is the situation with the mining industry that it has more fatalities than other industries because it is more dangerous and the challenges are higher.&quot;</P><P>The company said it also collected statistics on &quot;permanent damage injuries&quot;, and had other figures for health and safety, but that it only publicly disclosed what was required by the <A href=""http://www.globalreporting.org/Home"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Global Reporting Initiative</A> standards.</P><P>Peter Coates, Glencore non-executive director, said: &quot;Obviously, the high fatalities rate is totally unacceptable. As well as environmental issues, I think the major issue we must address is the high incidence of fatalities. I know a lot of those fatalities were caused by ground falls in one of our African operations and I have a very superficial understanding of what's being done to try and improve that situation. But, from a board point of view, that will be one of the first things we try to address. Management is responding and the board has to make a decision if they are responding fast enough. If not, we have to do something about that, either by providing enough resources for them, or encouragement.&quot;</P><P>Glencore also said that some of its problems were owing to recent acquisitions, or cases where the company took over full running of an operation. At its Katanga mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it took over management control in 2009, it said, &quot;more than $11m has been spent on reinforcing more than 1,900m of mine shaft roof and on completing mined-out production chamber support, following a thorough review of rock mechanics to improve safety&quot;.</P><P><A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/aug/29/vedanta-safety-awards-stripped"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">An investigation by the Observer last year</A> into the then 12 major London-listed mining companies found 154 work-related deaths revealed in annual reports and other shareholder filings. Vedanta had the highest toll, with 67, followed by Anglo American with 20 in one year, Kazakhmys with 17 and ENRC with 12.</P><P>Although not all companies said where the deaths took place, estimates suggest they were concentrated in India, Kazakhstan and South Africa. Eight Chilean miners were killed over the period studied, at mines operated by Xstrata and Antofagasta. However, the deaths showed a clear divide â although the FTSE100 companies studied had considerable mining interests in developed countries, they listed no deaths in North America and only seven in their large mining operations in Australia.</P><P>Environmental breaches at Glencore also became a focus of attention in advance of the company's flotation, and the company's report contains 25 pages on the subject, including details of four &quot;significant&quot; environmental fines totalling about $780,000 in 2010.</P><P>Glencore said: &quot;We consider any environmental fine over $10,000 to be 'significant', which is an indicator of how seriously we take our environmental responsibility. As we detail in the report, these fines related to encroachment (infringement on protected land) and a three-day interruption in the licence to operate at one of our production sites in Kazakhstan. We've reached agreements with the relevant authorities on these matters. We are not complacent about this at all, but clearly these fines are minor within the context of our global business.&quot;</P><P>Glencore's tax records are also likely to be pored over. Its tax liabilities show the company paid only $2m last year in tax and royalties on European revenues of more than $1bn. Glencore told the Guardian: &quot;We see our payment of taxes and royalties as a core part of our contribution to our host countries, alongside providing employment and our broader voluntary contributions to local communities.</P><P>&quot;In Europe the majority of revenues are earned by processing units â they are not subject to production royalties and have much higher cost bases and therefore lower taxable net margins than our mining interests elsewhere. Glencore is a involved in commodities production and marketing. Although our profits come roughly half from production and half from marketing, most of our revenues come from the marketing side. When we were a private company, taxation on our Swiss marketing business was paid by individual shareholders when they received their proceeds and therefore did not appear in our corporate accounts.&quot;</P><P>Renowned for disclosing as little as possible about its operations while a private company, Swiss-based Glencore has been forced to take a more open stance as its financial operations have come under unprecedented scrutiny in the wake of the listing.</P><P>Glencore is expected to produce its first annual full-year financial results next May, and is likely to hold an annual general meeting next June. The meeting is likely to be a focus of attention for environmental campaigners and other non-governmental organisations, according to Moody.</P><DIV class=""submeta""><SPAN class=""submeta__label"">Topics</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Not only did the flotation shine a light on &quot;<A href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/may/19/rise-of-glencore-commodities-company"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">the biggest company you've never heard of</A>&quot;, as some described the secretive, Switzerland-based private firm, but it also revealed the extraordinary extent of Glencore's assets and market influence.</P><P>As the <A href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/apr/16/glencore-flotation-editorial"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Guardian wrote in an editorial</A> ahead of the flotation: &quot;Glencore is the world's largest commodities trader, controlling 60% of the zinc market, 50% of the trade in copper, 45% of lead and a third of traded aluminium and thermal coal. Oh, and 3% of the world's oil and 9% of its grain too.&quot;</P><P>As part of its flotation,<A href=""http://www.glencore.com/sustainability.php"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline""> it announced</A> that it would soon be publishing its first-ever sustainability report.

It agreed.</P><P>Last Friday, after receiving an advance copy of its sustainability report - which is <A href=""http://www.glencore.com/sustainability-reporting.php"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">published in full today</A> - I emailed Glencore the following questions ahead of a conference call scheduled for Monday morningâ¦</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>* The report highlights 'Glencore Corporate Practice', which came into effect in 2010. It appears to be a self-auditing/regulating process. Will the next report, which promises to include the publication of specific targets and objectives, be overseen/advised by external, independent <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_social_responsibility"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">CSR</A> auditors?</P><P>* Please can you describe the process involved in collating all the information/data etc that went into publishing this report? How many people worked on it? How was data &quot;on the ground&quot; compiled from across the globe and then standardised for the report (expanding on details provided on p31)? Were there any &quot;holes&quot; in the data that caused frustration/problems? If so, what, and how will they be addressed for the next report?</P><P>* The report says that biofuels will be increasingly important to Glencore as it attempts to address <mark>climate change</mark> concerns. How does it aim to also reduce/mitigate its reliance on fossil fuels in coming years? Does Glencore aim to increase or decrease its reliance on the trading and extracting of fossil fuels as a core component of its business model over coming years?</P><P>* The report says Glencore is not yet signed up to any external codes of conduct relating to economic, environmental or social charters. When will this be addressed? Which external codes of conduct do you intend to sign up to first? Will Glencore, as part of the report's commitment to communication and openness, now allow independent inspectors - plus NGOs, journalists etc - to visit any of its facilities around the world?</P><P>* How soon will your new CSR standards, commitments and auditing processes be demanded of all your contractors and operations not currently operating directly under the Glencore name? What forms of sanction will you take regarding non-compliance?</P><P>* Please can you provide further details of the eight strikes mentioned on p45 of the report? Why did the strikes take place, and how were they resolved?</P><P>* The report says 56 fatalities were reported and recorded from 2008-2010. But no details are provided. Please can you say where and how these fatalities occurred? And do you also have figures for the number of serious injuries reported, too? What forms of compensation have the families of the deceased and injured received?</P><P>* On page 50, the report lists 173 complaints made by communities in 2010. How many of these complaints have now been resolved? Is there further breakdown available of where these complaints took place and specifically what they involved?</P><P>* What forms of compensation is Glencore planning for the 320 families being resettled in Prodeco, Colombia, as mentioned on page 53?</P><P>* The report on page 56 shows that Glencore paid $2m in taxes and royalties in Europe from revenues of just over $1bn, and around 5% taxes and royalties on global revenues of nearly $11bn in 2010. How does that demonstrate a commitment to host communities, as the report claims?</P><P>* Page 61 mentions four significant environmental fines worth $780k in 2010. Do you also have the figures/details for 2008 and 2009?</P><P>* Can you provide more details of the 11 &quot;moderate&quot; spillages reported on p64? Where/why etc?</P><P>* On pages 72-73 you detail how much renewable energy Glencore uses in its operations and distribution. How does Glencore define &quot;renewable energy&quot;?</P><P>* Please can you supply more details about Glencore's lobbying efforts, as alluded to on p57? What does Glencore lobby governments about? Please can you provide some specific examples? How much did Glencore spend on lobbying in 2010?</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>On Monday, a conference call then took place between myself and the following three representatives of Glencoreâ¦</P><P><A href=""http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/04/14/glencore-board-idUKLDE73D0EK20110414"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Peter Coates</A>, non-executive director, chairman of board's health, safety, environment committee (PC)<A href=""http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-1722490/Glencore-digs-deep-to-clean-up-its-act.html"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Michael Fahrbach</A>, head of corporate sustainability (MF)<A href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/feb/28/glencore-mulls-float"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Simon Buerk</A>, head of communications (SB)</P><P>Peter Coates, who joined Glencore's board earlier this year as part of the <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Initial Public Offering</A> (IPO) process, then began the discussion with some introductory points about the report and his roleâ¦</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>PC: It's early days and there's a lot of valuable work to be done. At this point in time, I've visited the African operations in the Zambia and the DRC [Democratic Republic of Congo]. I visited them with an open mind. I was aware there were some issues. I was very pleasantly surprised by what I saw. I saw an old business that over many years had been neglected. I saw a significant change occurring under Glencore. This was all prior to IPO which is what encouraged me that Glencore was trying to sort out the issues that are well documented.</P><P>LH: Was the IPO the catalyst for all this?</P><P>PC: I can't answer that. I doubt it because whatever has happened has happened over a couple of years. Glencore's only been in these operations for a couple of years. I think there was an understanding that a good <mark>sustainable</mark> business was a good commercial business. I know Glencore is very competitive. They have a desire to be recognised among their peers in the industry. There will be very strong support in the whole area of moving forward. This report is a first step; drawing a line in the sand. It will be marker for the board. The next time we produce a sustainability report there will be a lot more comparison of progress in there, I think. It will be a measuring tool to some extent for the board and investors.</P><P>LH: How will the target-setting work in practice?</P><P>PC: What we have to do is sort out some of the big issues and we know what they are. There are some significant environmental issues that are well documented â <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">SO2 emissions</A>, effluent emissions. Plans to sort those out have been in place for some time. There's also been a significant amount of money spent on reducing those emissions too â and there's a lot more to spend and that will be done. The other thing we have to address very, very quickly is safety. We know where we're coming from with that regard. From what I saw when I visited the operations, I saw a group of professional management who had identified the problems and who had well and truly entered the process of remediation â improving bolting techniques underground, improving ground control generally and trying to raise the standard of awareness amongst out employees in those countries. I've had a lot of experience in Africa. It's a lot more difficult and there's a lot more work to be done in raising the level of awareness about safety. It's chalk and cheese trying to compare this with, say, Australia. The board has to rattle the cage on those issues. </P><P>LH: Are you anticipating opening this whole process up to independent auditors and inspectors?</P><P>PC: The first step for me is to make sure the Glencore Corporate Practice (GCP) principles are being embraced and the process is being put in place to make sure they're enacted. Initially, I think we will develop processes that reassure us the board. We're not in the first instance about trying to reassure the public, if you like. But if that means independent audit, then that's what it'll be. Or if it means doing what many of us have done before and taking personnel out of one part of the business and forming an audit team with some independents in there as well then that's what we'll do. We will do whatever we have to do to gain the assurances we need as a board that we're complying with our duties and running this business in accordance with the objectives that we espouse.</P><P>LH: What will the time-frame be for implementing all this? Has the IPO driven this forward?</P><P>SB: We committed to doing a report long before [the IPO]. We haven't just emerged from nowhere. We are a very substantial business with a substantial amount of publicly traded debt and have had for a number of years. It's more of an evolution in terms of our openness. A hundred banks provided us with $13 billion of evolving credit â you don't get that unless you act very similarly to a public company.</P><P>LH: You knew that going for an IPO meant that a <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_social_responsibility"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">CSR report</A> had to be on the table fairly swiftly?</P><P>SB: We weren't not open before. We're a very substantial company with substantial public debt. We had to act in that way, anyway. Had we decided not to do the IPO for whatever reason we would have still published the report. The work had started long before that final decision had been taken.</P><P>PC: I was one of the initiators of Glencore Coal many years ago. In 1994, when I joined Glencore, it wasn't public then. And we kicked it off in Colombia and came back to Australia until 2002 when it became part of <A href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/xstrata"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Xstrata</A>. We have a solid, high standard of <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health,_Safety_and_Environment"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">HSE</A> across the board. You have to maintain your licence to operate which in those countries means we have significant concern for our impact on the community and workforce. I don't think you should make too much of the fact that this IPO transparency has opened up this company to achieving these standards. These standards are fundamentals of a good business.</P><P>MF: I joined the group in 2008 and there was already the idea for this report. The report is just part of a wider process, not just a standalone exercise. It's not just PR. It's part of a corporate programme.</P><P>LH: Can you please give more details about the 56 fatalities from 2008-2010 listed in the report?</P><P>MF: We are concerned about the figures because there's nothing more important than achieving no fatalities in your operations. The majority occurred in Africa and a significant proportion in South America and Asia. Most of them occurred underground. It is the situation with the mining industry that it has more fatalities than other industries because it is more dangerous and the challenges are higher.</P><P>LH: Do you have figures for serious injuries, too?</P><P>MF: Yes, we have for what we call &quot;permanent damage injuries&quot;. We have far more figures for health and safety, but we declare what we are asked by the <A href=""http://www.globalreporting.org/Home"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Global Reporting Initiative</A> standards.</P><P>SB: A lot of the assets that Glencore has acquired are brownfield sites. We have come in after a privatisation, or a later date, and there's a deteriorating asset that has been producing for a very long time. <A href=""http://www.glencore.com/katanga-mining.php"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Katanga</A> [in the DRC], for example. Originally, it was a private company, then run by the government, and then we came in. In many occasions, it's about improving an operation that's been running a long time before we've come in.</P><P>LH: Are your provisional 2011 figures showing any improvement yet?</P><P>PC: Obviously, the high fatalities rate is totally unacceptable. As well as environmental issues, I think the major issue we must address is the high incidence of fatalities. I know a lot of those fatalities were caused by ground falls in one of our African operations and I have a very superficial understanding of what's being done to try and improve that situation. But, from a board point of view, that will be one of the first things we try to address. Management is responding and the board has to make a decision if they are responding fast enough. If not, we have to do something about that, either by providing enough resources for them, or encouragement.</P><P>LH: The term &quot;zero harm&quot; is used in the report as a goal. What time-frame do you put on achieving &quot;zero harm&quot;?</P><P>PC: You can't put a time-frame on that because it depends on the region. A zero-harm time-frame in Australia might be 12 months, in South African it might be 5 years, and central or northern Africa it might be 10 years. You've got make continuous improvement.</P><P>LH: What is your policy regarding compensation for the families of those killed. Is there a pan-global policy?</P><P>PC: I can't answer that. It's not something that we have addressed to date. The next board meeting will be the first time we sit down with management and look very closely at this issue. Most of the board meetings to date have been associated with the IPO and going public. Now we'll move into seriously addressing safety.</P><P>MF: There is one example in the report of the challenges of taking over the Katanga operation. We found an operation, for example, where miners were sent by the previous owners into mining areas that were totally unacceptable because of the risk of rockfall etc. So, as the case study in the report shows, when we're working on strengthening the mine the safety record improves immediately.</P><P>PC: You never have the luxury of saying that you've got there [in terms of the zero-harm policy]. Inevitably, we harm people. But you've got to set the objective of zero harm. If you can achieve a decent standard of continuous improvement you are satisfying your obligations to your employees and the communities in which you are operating.</P><P>LH: The report says you aim to support communities, so why is the tax you pay so low? Why, for example, does the report declare that Glencore paid just $2m on about $1bn of revenue in Europe for 2010?</P><P>MF: We blow our revenues up compared to other mining companies because we are a trading house, too. Glencore will always look bad compared to other producers. A more fair way to view it would be on the margins.</P><P>LH: But $2m in Europe is still a very small numberâ¦</P><P>SB: In a trading company, revenue is not a very good measurement of the company. So when commodity prices go up, revenues go up automatically, but profits go up much less. As a private company, as is normal in Switzerland, the taxation was actually paid by the individual shareholder when they were paid out at the end of their career. So the tax wasn't levied on the marketing [trading] business, as you would see here [in UK], it was actually paid when the people received the monies they had made in the company. You can't work out what it is either as the taxation varies between the cantons in Switzerland. Our CEO, for example, lives in one of the higher tax cantons.</P><P>LH: But compared to the rest of Europe, [the tax take] is presumably still very small by comparison?</P><P>SB: No, that's not true. In Zurich, I think it's about 38%. Anyway, going forward, in the figures for 2011 you will see us paying corporation tax, as is normal for a public company.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Glencore later sent me the following clarification regarding its tax affairs, in further response to this question:</P><P><EM>From revenues of $1 billion on Europe, there was just $2 million paid in taxes and royalties. How do you square that with commitment to local communities? In fact in general your tax payments seem a low proportion of revenues?</EM></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>We see our payment of taxes and royalties as a core part of our contribution to our host countries, alongside providing employment and our broader voluntary contributions to local communities. It is local, regional and national governments that set tax rates, and they determine how those funds are spent, including what proportion is spent near to our operations. </P><P>We are also announcing in the sustainability report our support for the <A href=""http://eiti.org/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative</A> as we believe that transparency in the disbursement of our direct economic contributions is important, both for us and for those who receive them. </P><P>We have produced the report in line with GRI guidelines, so we show a table comparing taxes and royalties, wages, and contributions to communities, with revenues. Of course, in reality, many corporate taxes are based on profits rather than revenues, and therefore a simple comparison of taxes and revenues may not give an accurate picture. In Europe, the majority of revenues are earned by processing units - they are not subject to production royalties and have much higher cost bases and, therefore, lower taxable net margins than our mining interests elsewhere. </P><P>When you look at our taxation more broadly, there are a couple of other things you should bear in mind. Glencore is a involved in commodities production and marketing. Although our profits come roughly half from production and half from marketing, most of our revenues come from the marketing side. This makes a comparison with pure mining companies difficult on this metric. You should also bear in mind that when we were a private company, taxation on our Swiss marketing business was paid by individual shareholders when they received their proceeds and therefore did not appear in our corporate accounts. This will no longer be the case now we are a public company.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The interview continued...</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>PC: In Zambia and the DRC I saw the contribution that Glencore has made. It has acted responsibly to date: there's been a big contribution to employment and a lot of capital investment â hospitals, schools. I saw a genuine effort. I'm satisfied as a director that what's been done to date has been very satisfactory and very responsible and I'm looking forward to taking the company into a new area and making a significant improvement.</P><P>LH: Will you be signing up to any external code of conducts? </P><P>MF: Our report is <A href=""http://www.globalreporting.org/Home"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">GRI compliant</A>. It is a strong commitment that we accept international standards and aim to meet and obey them. There is no policy that we won't sign up to any codes.</P><P>LH: The report briefly acknowledges Glencore's lobbying activities. What are Glencore's lobbying efforts?</P><P>MF: We are not doing that much in that area. We are members are some trade associations who support our interests. In the chemicals industries, for example, you find the big companies in Europe have offices in Brussels where they talk to government officials and members of parliament, but you won't find this at Glencore.</P><P>LH: You don't have a lobbying office in Washington DC or Brussels?</P><P>MF: For the moment, no. I'm not saying we won't, but at the moment there is not an instant call for this.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>After the call ended, Simon Buerk emailed me his response to some of the outstanding questions I had first raised on Friday:</P><P><EM>The report says that biofuels will be increasingly important to Glencore as it attempts to address <mark>climate change</mark> concerns. How does it aim to also reduce/mitigate its reliance on fossil fuels in coming years? Does Glencore aim to increase or decrease its reliance on the trading and extracting of fossil fuels as a core component of its business model over coming years?</EM></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>The world is currently seeking the optimum combination of energy sources that can mitigate <mark>climate change</mark> while ensuring a secure and affordable energy supply. Our role is to both increase the supply of commodities the world needs to support global living standards, and ensure they get to where they are needed in the most efficient way possible. The world clearly still needs oil and coal, and we continue to invest in these businesses. We anticipate new technologies making fossil fuel usage more efficient and reducing emissions. And even in scenarios where the energy mix does shift decisively towards renewable resources, there will be a lengthy transition period with meaningful requirements for <mark>carbon</mark>-based power production and mobility. For many years agricultural products have also been a core part of our business. We see demand from our customers for biofuels and agricultural products used in their production, so we have been actively investing in this area too for a number of years. In the report we talk about one of those investments, in a biofuels production business in Brazil, but we have similar projects elsewhere in the world and we are are excited about them as businesses.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><EM>On page 50, the report lists 173 complaints made by communities in 2010. How many of these complaints have now been resolved? Is there further breakdown available of where these complaints took place and specifically what they involved? </EM></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>We want to be good neighbours, contributing to the local community in employment, revenues to government and social projects. We take any complaint seriously and try to take action where we can. Most of the complaints in 2010 were related to an effluent issue that we inherited from the previous operators at one of our projects in Africa. Work is ongoing to fix this problem - we expect it to be completed by the end of this year. We hope and expect that there will then be fewer complaints going forward.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><EM>Can you provide more details of the 11 &quot;moderate&quot; spillages reported on p64? Where/why etc? </EM></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>These are mostly small spillages from tailings dams at mining facilities. We take these spillages seriously, and in each case we have entirely remediated the effects and investigated to ensure that similar incidents don't happen again. But no incident on its own was significant either to the environment or to safety.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><EM>Page 61 mentions four significant environmental fines worth $780k in 2010... </EM></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>We consider any environmental fine over $10,000 to be 'significant', which is an indicator of how seriously we take our environmental responsibility. As we detail in the report, these fines related to encroachment (infringement on protected land) and a three-day interruption in the licence to operate at one of our production sites in Kazakhstan. We've reached agreements with the relevant authorities on these matters and reported them in line with GRI G3 requirements. We are not complacent about this at all, but clearly these fines are minor within the context of our global business.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><EM>On page 72-73 you detail how much renewable energy Glencore uses in its operations and distribution. How does Glencore define &quot;renewable energy&quot;?</EM></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>We use hydro-electric power in some of our operations around the world, including in fact running a substantial hydro-electric facility at our Kazzinc project in Kazakhstan. This makes it simple for us to define renewable energy and we don't have the same complicated definition issues consumers of biofuels, for example, have to consider in their reporting.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><EM>Please can you provide further details of the eight strikes mentioned on p45 of the report? Why did the strikes take place, and how were they resolved?</EM></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>As we note in the report most of these strikes occurred in South America. We of course try hard to avoid strikes, including by negotiating with our workers on wages and benefits.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><EM>What forms of compensation is Glencore planning for the 320 families being resettled in <A href=""http://www.glencore.com/prodeco-group.php"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Prodeco, Colombia</A>, as mentioned on page 53?</EM></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>In 2010, our only operation to be affected by resettlement activity was Prodeco in Colombia. This will have an impact on communities near our Calenturitas site. This resettlement will occur together with other operators in this area and in close collaboration with the Colombian authorities and of course the affected communities. The companies are still investigating the possible effects and consulting with local communities to reach a common consensus. This will establish the appropriate processes for the resettlement.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><DIV class=""submeta""><SPAN class=""submeta__label"">Topics</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

We have a very interesting supply and demand picture being set up.â</P><P>Anglo American, which not long ago wanted to unload its coal assets, has seen income from the business triple since 2015 to become the mining companyâs most profitable commodity. Last year, Glencore reported earnings from the fuel more than doubled, while BHP Billiton said it surged sixfold.</P><P>While global coal use and mine output has been dropping, production failed to keep pace with demand in 2016 for the first time in seven years, data compiled by BP Plc show.

With growing concern about <mark>climate change</mark>, lenders shrank funding for the industry to $14.9 billion last year from $22.5 billion in 2015, according to BankTrack. At least 15 of the biggest banks have policies that prevent investing in coal projects. <A itemscope=""itemscope"" itemprop=""StoryLink"" href=""/quote/JPM:US"" title=""Company Overview"">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</A>, HSBC Holdings Plc and Credit Suisse Group AG wonât fund new mines, while Societe Generale SA and Deutsche Bank AG go even further with bans on loans for coal-fired power plants.</P><P>And itâs not just banks. Big investors are increasingly turning their backs on coal.</P><P>In 2012, activist group 350.org started the <mark>climate</mark> divestment movement. So far, more than 850 institutions have committed to quitting coal investments. Norwayâs $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the worldâs largest equity investor, sold off most of its coal stocks. California lawmakers required the stateâs pension funds to divest any coal holding. Asset managers including Allianz SE, Swiss Re AG and Storebrand ASA have similar policies.</P><P>âThe pressure on the investment industry to reduce the amount of capital that we make available to the coal industry is increasing,â said Nick Stansbury, a fund manager at Legal &amp; General Group Plc, the U.K.âs largest manager of pension assets. âThat will lead to this industry facing a rising cost of capital.&quot;</P><P data-tout-type=""story""><A itemscope=""itemscope"" itemprop=""StoryLink"" href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-12-20/coal-s-resilience-will-be-its-downfall"" title=""Click for full story"" target=""_blank"">For discussion of why coal is seeing a rebound, click here.</A></P><P>Australiaâs $2.3 billion Carmichael coal venture illustrates the challenge. Prices are the highest in six years, and the government was so eager to get production started that it overruled concerns the project could damage the Great Barrier Reef. Despite that support, developer <A itemscope=""itemscope"" itemprop=""StoryLink"" href=""/quote/ADE:IN"" title=""Company Overview"">Adani Enterprises Ltd.</A> is struggling to get funding and has abandoned a 2020 target date to begin mining. Itâs already been rejected by three Chinese banks and lenders including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Investec Ltd.</P><P>Even big producers -- which have deep enough pockets to build projects without bank support -- arenât interested in adding to supplies. Melbourne-based BHP has said the world needs to combat <mark>climate change</mark> by reducing harmful emissions. London-based Anglo American says burning coal will increasingly be contested by governments and consumers, and that use of the fuel will ultimately decline.</P><P>Anglo American cut production by 20 percent in the past five years and wonât spend any more money on its existing mines. BHP, which mostly mines coking coal used to make steel, plans to run its thermal coal mines for cash, while it focuses on commodities like oil and copper. Rio Tinto Group sold all its mines.</P><H3>No New Mines</H3><P>Glencore, the top seller on international markets, is the only major producer committed to the fuel. The Baar, Switzerland-based company is buying mines from rivals, but the company says it wonât build new ones.</P><P>While declining supply should support profits for those still mining the fuel, the industry remains at risk. Most thermal coal mined each year is used by domestic power plants, leaving less than a fifth of output available for the export market, which is dominated by China.</P><P>China burns five times as much coal as the U.S., and it both mines and imports more than anyone else. The Asian country relies on overseas purchases to make up for domestic supply shortfalls. That poses a &quot;cliff edge risk&quot; for companies including Glencore and Anglo, because even a small drop in Chinese consumption could have a disproportionate impact on international demand, according to Stansbury, the Legal &amp; General fund manager.</P><P>In 2016, prices for thermal coal more than doubled after China curbed production. Desperate to address a chronic air-<mark>pollution</mark> problem by reducing industrial emissions, China has continued to mandate further cuts. In March, it pledged to shrink coal output by 150 million tons this year and steel capacity by 30 million tons. Imports of coal may drop in 2018 for the first time in three years, according to <A itemscope=""itemscope"" itemprop=""StoryLink"" href=""/news/terminal/P78VTD6K50XS"" title=""Chinaâs Coal Imports May Fall for First Time in Three Years"" class=""terminal-news-story"" target=""_blank"">Bloomberg Intelligence</A>.</P><P>Ultimately, higher prices for coal could accelerate the shift toward cleaner fuels. Already, competition has increased from power stations running on natural gas, wind turbines and solar panels, all of which are getting cheaper to build and operate. Thatâs eroding the economic argument for continuing to burn a fuel with such high emissions, even in developing countries.</P><P>Toxic levels of <mark>pollution</mark> led to the early annual death of an estimated 7 million people, according to a new World Health Organization report.</P><P>âThis is a lethal product in the way that it is consumed in much of the world,â Stansbury said. âProviding energy to people who otherwise donât have access to it is hugely socially useful, but coal is not the most useful form of energy to provide.â</P><DIV class=""trashline"">(<SPAN itemprop=""description"">Updates with WHO report in the second-to-last paragraph.</SPAN>)</DIV></DIV><ASIDE class=""left-column""><DIV class=""text-to-speech""><DIV class=""text-to-speech__label"">LISTEN TO ARTICLE</DIV></DIV></ASIDE></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

Becker owns more than 630,000 shares of Bunge.</SPAN></P><H4><STRONG>U.S. Hunt</STRONG></H4><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Itâs no secret that Glencore, led by billionaire Ivan Glasenberg, has been on the hunt for assets in the U.S. grain industry. Glencoreâs Chris Mahoney, who runs the agriculture unit, said in an interview with Bloomberg News published earlier this month that the company was having trouble finding â willing sellers.â Within a day of those comments, Bunge Chief Executive Officer Soren Schroder indicated to analysts on an earnings conference call that his company would be open to participating in industry deals.</SPAN></P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""twitter-tweet"" data-width=""550""><P lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">A Glencore deal for Bunge would make the Swiss mining giant a major player in the U.S. agriculture market<A href=""https://t.co/4egpDiZVJo"">https://t.co/4egpDiZVJo</A></P><P>â Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) <A href=""https://twitter.com/WSJ/status/867105403141795840"">May 23, 2017</A></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">âI think itâs very much ABCD and G now,â Mahoney, 58, said in the interview at his office in central Rotterdam, just inland from Europeâs biggest port. Glencore is already the worldâs largest wheat trader and biggest merchant of pulses such as chickpeas.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">The deal would give Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore access to Bungeâs vast networks of trucks, barges and elevators, including infrastructure throughout North and South America. Almost 40 percent of Bungeâs long-terms assets are in Brazil, where Glencore has expanded through a purchase earlier this year of a sugar mill.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Glencore stock fell 1.1 percent to 288.85 pence by 8:07 a.m. in London, valuing the company at about $54 billion.</SPAN></P><H4><STRONG>Bunge Shares</STRONG></H4><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Shares of Bunge closed 17 percent higher at $81.70 Tuesday after Glencore confirmed its interest, the stockâs biggest gain since 2008. Bungeâs shares drifted to $78.95 in after-hours trading before Bungeâs statement saying it wasnât in talks with Glencore.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">âBunge is committed to continuing to execute its global agri-foods strategy and pursuing opportunities for driving growth and value creation,â the White Plains-based company said in the statement.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Glencore may have to pay more than $100 per share to buy Bunge, Vertical Research said in a report.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">âPeople look at us just like we look at everybody else every day,â Schroder said in an interview earlier this month. âI am not surprised. We are a very attractive company.â</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Several years of commodity price declines have helped spur the series of mega-deals currently reshaping the seed and chemical industry, including Bayer AGâs planned acquisition of Monsanto Co. and Dow Chemical Co.âs merger with DuPont Co.</SPAN></P><P>Â </P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">In contrast, the grain-handling industry has seen relatively little deal-making over the period. ADM stands out as the exception, with the Chicago-based company selling its stake in GrainCorp Ltd., eastern Australiaâs largest grain handler, after its takeover bid was blocked. It now ranks as the largest shareholder in palm oil-grower Wilmar International Ltd.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">âConsolidation is desperately needed,â and would be âconstructiveâ for margins, Heather Jones, a Richmond, Virginia-based analyst for Vertical Group, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. âBunge seems the most obvious target. Itâs more digestible than some of the other properties out there.â</SPAN></P><H4><STRONG>Glencore Deals</STRONG></H4><FIGURE id=""attachment_92438"" style=""width: 317px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">The logo of Glencore is pictured in front of the companyâs headquarters in the Swiss town of Baar, in this 2012 file photo. REUTERS/Michael Buholzer/Files</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">The last time there was a round of mergers in the industry, it wasnât the ABCDs that led the way, but Glencore, which bought Canadian grain merchant Viterra Inc. for C$6.1 billion ($4.5 billion) in 2012, and Japanâs Marubeni Corp., which acquired Gavilon Group LLC for $2.6 billion the following year.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Glencore spun off its agriculture unit after its existential crisis in late 2015 when commodity prices plunged and debt concerns sent the stock tumbling to a record low. In part to weather the storm, Glencore sold 49 percent of its agriculture unit to two pension funds â Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and British Columbia Investment Management Corp. â for $3.1 billion.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">The sale created a new company with its own balance sheet, which isnât guaranteed by Glencore itself. The business reported earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation, attributable to Glencore, of $592 million last year, compared with $830 million for Dreyfus, the smallest of the ABCD companies.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mahoney, who won a silver medal in rowing at the Moscow Olympics in 1980, attempted another big agriculture deal in 2011, exploring a merger with Louis Dreyfus. The companies, after several weeks of talks, were several billion dollars apart in valuation and the deal never happened.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Peter Grauer, the chairman of Bloomberg LP, is a senior independent non-executive director at Glencore.</SPAN></P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The mega multinational now has a presence in more than 50 countries, covering <A href=""http://www.glencore.com/who-we-are/the-group/"">all five continents</A>.</P><P>With more than $US232 billion in annual income, Glencore Xstrata breezed in at <A href=""http://fortune.com/global500/glencore-10/"">number 10 in 2014's Fortune Global 500</A>, the list of the 500 biggest corporations in the world by revenue.</P><P><STRONG>Corporate capture of Peruvian politics</STRONG></P><P>While Glencore Xstrata likes to position itself publicly as <EM>&quot;<A href=""http://www.xstratacoal.com/EN/.../Pages/<mark>Sustainable</mark>Development.aspx"">one of the most responsible mining companies in the world</A>&quot;</EM>, on the ground its operations are directly driving a <A href=""http://www.odg.cat/sites/default/files/impunity_inc.pdf"">number of conflicts</A> related to environmental contamination and human rights violations in countries such as Zambia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bolivia and Colombia, as well as in Peru.</P><P>Meanwhile, at the international level, Glencore Xstrata is actively pushing for the continued use of <A href=""http://www.glencore.com/public-positions/<mark>carbon</mark>-policy/"">coal and fossil fuels</A> which will only further exacerbate the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> and aggravate conflict.</P><P>To legitimise the aggressive expansion of its destructive business model, Glencore predicts a future in which global demand will see fossil fuels make up 75% of the world's energy mix by 2050. In other words: business as usual.</P><P>In order to protect and promote that vision Glencore Xstrata has not only embedded itself in industry lobby groups at the national level in countries like Peru.</P><P>It is also strategically positioned in an enormous global network of over 60 international lobbying organisations, with the intention of capturing <mark>climate change</mark> policy spaces and processes at all levels.</P><P><STRONG>Peru's </STRONG><STRONG>Espinar Province: mineral rich, water poor</STRONG></P><P>Nestled in the Southern Peruvian Andes is the province of Espinar, home to Glencore Xstrata's Tintaya and Antapaccay mining projects.</P><P>The province has a population of over 60,000 people, mostly farmers. The one hundred plus lakes and four major river basins in the area are the region's lifeblood.</P><P>Just as <mark>climate change</mark> impacts begin to take hold in the Peruvian Andes, the expansion of ever more ambitious mining operations - such as those Glencore Xstrata is pursuing - is putting extreme pressure on the most basic element of life: water.</P><P>In June 2012, in the face of intense and ongoing social pressure, the Peruvian government arranged for an official environmental and health assessment to be carried out in Espinar, downstream from the Tintaya and Antapaccay mines. The results released in mid-2013 proved the widespread existence of contamination.</P><DIV style=""float: right; margin: 5px; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black; width: 200px;""><EM>&quot;The Espinar Province is at risk of intense water stress if serious measures aren't taken now, but the government is more concerned about the mining sector&quot; - </EM>Oscar Mollohuanca, former mayor of Espinar.</DIV><P>The assessment found heavy metals such as <A href=""http://www.cooperaccion.org.pe/documentos/13-06-12_Pronunciamiento_MPE_MSAP.pdf"">arsenic and molybdenum</A> in both the superficial and underground water.</P><P>It was also proven that 100% of people living in the communities directly affected by Tintaya are exposed to highly harmful arsenic, thallium, and lead.</P><P>Glencore Xstrata has continued to deny any responsibility. In January 2014 the corporation was fined 235,600 Soles (around US$80,000) by a local court for the presence of high levels of copper in local pasture land.</P><P>Small change for the corporate giant. According to the multinational the copper was <EM>&quot;naturally occurring&quot;</EM>, but investigations have since linked the contamination to <A href=""http://noticias.terra.com.pe/peru/peru-sanciona-glencore-xstrata-por-contaminacion,fccd681c2c253410VgnCLD2000000dc6eb0aRCRD.html"">Glencore's infrastructure</A>.</P><P>Disputes for control and management of water resources are set to worsen due to the rapid and ongoing melting of Andean glaciers. For mining expert JosÃ© de Echave, Espinar is an area where the challenges of co-existence with mining are magnified by the onset of <mark>climate change</mark> impacts.</P><P>Despite this grim reality, the national government has <A href=""http://www.cooperaccion.org.pe/OCM/XIII_OCM_2013-12-12br"">continued to hand out mining concessions</A> in areas on which communities depend for their fresh water sources.</P><P>Currently<A href=""http://www.cooperaccion.org.pe/OCM/XIV_OCM_2014-07-15.pdf""> 50% of new mining projects</A> are in the south of Peru, including the Espinar province, resulting in heightened community vulnerability and increased likelihood of further social and environmental conflict.</P><P><STRONG>Public protection of private interests:</STRONG><STRONG>The </STRONG><STRONG>criminalisation of protest</STRONG></P><P>Like many <A href=""http://www.globalwitness.org/perudeadlyenvironment/"">environmental defenders across Peru</A>, the people of Espinar are no strangers to conflict. Speaking at an event at the People's Summit in Lima, former mayor of Espinar Oscar Mollohuanca described how the communities impacted by Tintaya and Antapaccay are still reeling from the violent repression of protest in the region in May 2012.</P><P>When Xstrata and central government ignored local demands communities quickly mobilised, organising an indefinite strike. In response the government sent police to the province to contain the mobilisations and protect Xstrata's infrastructure.</P><P>Over the days that followed police repression escalated, resulting in two civilian deaths and many more injuries, forcing the government to declare a state of emergency.</P><P>During the conflict several community leaders and local human rights defenders were <A href=""http://www.frontlinedefenders.org/node/26271"">arrested and subjected to abuse at the hands of police</A>.</P><P>Mollohuanca was among those held for several days. He currently faces legal charges for 'instigation' and other 'crimes' that he allegedly committed.JosÃ© de Echave claimed the corporation also behaved deplorably in the conflict, with police acting as their private security force.</P><DIV style=""float: right; margin: 5px; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black; width: 200px;""><EM>&quot;Our performance in terms of complying with our obligations, protection of the environment, human rights and health.... is for us of profound importance&quot; - </EM>Glencore Xstrata.</DIV><P>Those claims have since been validated. In 2013 it was revealed that the <A href=""http://assets.gfbv.ch/downloads/report_spanisch_def_2_12_13.pdf"">Peruvian police signed a series of agreements</A> with at least 13 natural resources corporations to provide them with paid private security, among them Glencore Xstrata.</P><P>Peruvian human rights organisations have asserted that these agreements facilitate the criminalisation of protest by allowing police to make arbitrary arrests, torture human rights defenders and journalists, and that they constitute a <A href=""http://derechoshumanos.pe/2013/03/rocio-silva-santisteban-advierte-en-la-cidh-se-esta-privatizando-la-policia-nacional-del-peru"">systematic abuse of power</A>.</P><P>That the corporation has managed to build such a cosy relationship with state institutions is yet more evidence of its economic and political clout in a country that feels under huge pressure to bow to the demands of foreign investors.</P><P><STRONG>Glencore Xstrata - meddling in Peruvian politics</STRONG></P><P>Glencore Xstrata's ability to embed itself within state institutions goes beyond (ab)use of the police force. In July 2014 the Peruvian government passed 'Law 30230'.</P><P>This controversial <A href=""http://upsidedownworld.org/main/peru-archives-76/4956-peru-passes-a-packet-of-neoliberal-reforms-erodes-environmental-protections-and-labor-rights"">bundle of economic reforms</A>, referred to as the 'paquetazo', has facilitated massive environmental and social deregulation. The reforms, which effectively clear a path for further intensification of extractive industries in the region, carry the fingerprints of multinational corporate pressure all over them.</P><P>Glencore Xstrata is a member of Peru's National Association of Mining, Oil and Energy (FUENTE), one of the most powerful industry associations in the country, made up of both national and international mining interests.</P><P>According to the Observatory of Mining Conflicts, FUENTE launched an intense media campaign running up to the approval of the paquetazo which asserted that the Peruvian economy was <EM>&quot;slowing down&quot;</EM> as a consequence of excessive regulation.</P><P>The campaign put pressure on the government to create a <EM>&quot;<A href=""http://www.cooperaccion.org.pe/OCM/XIV_OCM_2014-07-15.pdf%20""><mark>climate</mark> of investment</A>&quot;</EM> that suited their interests. The same corporate representatives continue to push for additional policy changes that would further deregulate the Peruvian economy.</P><P><STRONG>Coal before <mark>climate</mark>, profit before people</STRONG></P><P>Like many Northern corporations operating in South America Glencore Xstrata not only has local influence in its many countries of operation, but also internationally - via a network of lobby groups working to protect and promote its interests at all levels.</P><P>Before merging with Glencore, Xstrata Australia was part of the self-proclaimed '<A href=""http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Greenhouse_mafia"">greenhouse mafia</A>', a group that defends the interests of dirty industry and works to prevent Australia from implementing meaningful <mark>climate change</mark> policy.</P><P>Glencore is also a member of the influential Australian Industry Greenhouse Network (AIGN), a notorious fossil fuel lobby which has sent delegates to numerous UNFCCC COPs.</P><P>AIGN boasts of <A href=""http://aign.net.au/about/"">advising the Australian government delegation</A> at the <mark>climate</mark> talks. Following such advice would see Australia <A href=""http://www.aign.net.au/membership"">reneging on its legal and moral commitments</A> as a developed country to cut emissions while providing finance and technology to developing countries.</P><P>Worryingly Glencore is having considerable success within the UNFCCC, both by shaping Australian negotiating positions, and by using its lobby groups to create a <mark>climate</mark>-friendly narrative around fossil fuels.</P><P><STRONG>A perfect storm of corporate misconduct</STRONG></P><P>Frontline communities, such as those in Espinar, are finding themselves pushed into increased vulnerability as <mark>climate change</mark> bites into precious water resources already under stress from mega-mining activities.</P><P>With its global operations and well-oiled lobbying machine, Glencore Xstrata represents a corporate attempt at full spectrum dominance. To facilitate its minerals rush in countries like Peru Glencore Xstrata is not only co-opting state forces to repress resistance but also infiltrating national government, pushing for policies that serve its narrow interests.</P><P>The web of influence simultaneously extends to the international level, infiltrating delegation teams to the UNFCCC in a bid to ensure that <mark>climate</mark> policies do not put their extractive business model at threat.</P><P>Glencore Xstrata's conduct signals the deeper systemic issues underlying the <mark>climate</mark> crisis. The impunity of such multinationals on the ground, and their successful capture of domestic and international decision-making spaces, needs to be challenged with action that is coordinated, strategic and based on strong links of international solidarity.</P><P>Â </P><P><STRONG>This article</STRONG> is taken from the report '<A href=""http://democracyctr.org/corporate/resources-for-action-2/corporate-conquistadors/"">Corporate Conquistadors: The Many Ways Multinationals Both Drive and Profit from <mark>Climate</mark> Destruction</A>', published December 2014 by the Democracy Center, Corporate Europe Observatory and the Transnational Institute.</P><P>Â </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

It is not possible to cover all of these topics in this report.
The following is a selection.
The companies we engaged in a dialogue in 2015, and the type of topics that were discussed are shown in the overview at the end of this chapter.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""vvb-item"" id=""milieu-en-klimaatverandering""><DIV class=""typo""><H2>Environment and <mark>climate change</mark></H2><P>We expect companies to have good insight into the environmental risks they run and a policy on how to deal with them. The greatest risk at the moment, which affects almost all of our investments, is <mark>climate change</mark>. In particular, it is vital that energy companies and companies with high <mark>CO2</mark> emissions respond to this. Real estate can also play a significant role in reducing emissions.</P><H4>Shell and the Arctic</H4><P>We publicly expressed our doubts about the plans of Anglo-Dutch oil company Shell to drill for oil in the Arctic at its shareholdersâ meeting in the spring. This was held shortly after the United States government had given permission for trial drilling. Partly on the basis of information from environmental organization Greenpeace and specialists in the oil world, we had serious doubts about the risks of the project, both for the environment and for the shareholders. These doubts were not dispelled by a visit by one of our staff to the drilling area. We notified Shell that it could do better by developing gas and oil fields off the coast of Brazil. We were, therefore, happy when Shell announced after initial drilling that it would end activities in the Arctic.</P><H4>Fracking</H4><P>The Disclosing the facts survey published at the end of 2015 showed that oil and gas companies are increasingly following the guidelines we adopted some years ago, on extracting shale gas and oil. Disclosing the facts reports each year on how the thirty largest oil and gas companies that use fracking<SUP>13 </SUP>provide information to investors on,
for example, the use of toxic chemicals, emissions of waste gases, water consumption and the effect on local communities. This was discussed with eight companies in 2015 and all but one displayed clear progress in the latest report.</P><H4>Divestment from coal</H4><P>We have asked the Chinese wind energy company Longyuan to reconsider its coal activities (about 10% of the total) and investigate whether a complete transition to renewable energy would be more attractive. We expect this would increase the value of the company as coal currently generates poor returns and involves risks. The company
has not yet done this but the discussions continue.</P><H4>Voting for <mark>CO2</mark> reductions</H4><P>Along with other investors<SUP>14 </SUP>Â we have worked on resolutions for the shareholdersâ meetings of mining companies Glencore, Rio Tinto and Anglo American that will be voted on in 2016. We want these companies to report more clearly on the amounts of <mark>CO2</mark> they emit, how they link the reduction targets to their remuneration policy, how they are responding to possible new <mark>climate policy</mark> from governments and their lobbying in this area. Last year we voted in favor of similar shareholdersâ resolutions at Shell and BP. Both resolutions were accepted by their boards.</P><P>We voted against a shareholdersâ resolution at Apple calling for more insight into the risks it faces as a result of possible national, state and local government measuresÂ on <mark>climate change</mark>. Apple already provides sufficient information on this.</P><P>In total we voted on over 100 shareholdersâ resolutions on environmental subjects, supporting about two-thirds of them. Consequently most resolutions on combating <mark>climate change</mark> and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions could count on our vote. Most votes against (28) were exercised in Japan where far-reaching resolutions on ending nuclear energy and moving to renewable sources were presented at several meetings. Although we support the transition to <mark>sustainable</mark> energy, in our opinion these resolutions were not the right way of approaching this. Some specified what management had to do in excessive detail, others would have meant, in practice, a prohibition on the use of nuclear energy.</P><P><SUB>13. In fracking, oil and gas is extracted from hard shale after it has been cracked by injecting large quantities of water, sand and chemicals into the ground.
14. We are working with the Aiming for A coalition, which is in dialogue with the ten largest listed mining and utilities companies in the United Kingdom to encourage them to reduce their <mark>CO2</mark> emissions.</SUB></P><P>Â </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""vvb-item"" id=""mensenrechten""><DIV class=""typo""><H2>Human Rights</H2><P>The UN Global Compact, which is one of the foundations of our responsible investment approach, states that companies may not be complicit in breaches of human rights. They also have to avoid their activities leading or contributing to them.</P><H4>No drugs for the death penalty</H4><P>We sold our shares in American pharmaceutical company Mylan after it did not meet our request to ensure its muscle relaxants could not be used in carrying out the death penalty. We contacted the company on the back of information from an NGO on the use of its rocuronium bromide in executions in the United States. Mylan then stated on its website that its products were not intended for use in executions. The company did not want to clarify measures it had taken to prevent actual use in executions or whether it delivered muscle relaxants to American prisons that could use them in the death penalty. In a later discussion, Mylan stated its delivery contracts include a clause on unintended use of its products. That was not sufficient for us as there is no check on compliance.</P><H4>Preventing repeated problems</H4><P>At our request, the British-Danish security company G4S published more information on how it applied its human rights policy and what it had learned from complaints by stakeholders on activities in Israel, Cuba and Papua-New Guinea. It also announced a centralization of complaints procedures so management can identify possible
malpractice at the local level more quickly. Oil company Chevron responded positively to our suggestion to centralize complaints procedures.</P><P>The Chinese mining company Zijin Mining, which suspended operations in Peru after fierce protests by local people, has committed to examine the possibility of a complaints procedure so people affected can express their concerns to the company. This has not yet led to clear results. We will continue monitoring this.</P><H4>Operations in disputed territory</H4><P>Oil company Total explained to us how it dealt with different people in Western Sahara who strive for independence from Morocco, which regards the region as part of its territory. The French company had been licensed by the Moroccan government to search for oil off the coast of Western Sahara. We wanted to be certain that Total was acting in line with international regulations on disputed territories which state that the interests of the local population must be served when extracting commodities and that they should benefit from the proceeds.
Total explained the discussions it had with the local communities. Arrangements had been made on sharing any future revenues equitably. A few months after our talks, Total announced it had not renewed the licenses and is no longer operating in Western Sahara.</P><H4>Voting on human rights and labor rights resolutions</H4><P>We voted in favor of six resolutions on human and labor rights at the shareholdersâ meetings of nineteen companies. We supported resolutions at Caterpillar (machinery manufacturer), Kroger (supermarket chain) and T-Mobile US (telecoms) for more information on measures to combat violations of human rights. We did not support similar resolutions at Facebook, Amazon.com and eleven other companies because in our opinion they already do enough and additional obligations would involve an unnecessary burden. Resolutions on human and labor rights are, however, less than 2% of all resolutions that shareholders submitted in 2015 at the meetings of companies in which we hold shares.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""vvb-item"" id=""fatsoenlijke-arbeidsomstandigheden""><DIV class=""typo""><H2>Working conditions</H2><P>We want employees of companies we invest in to be free to join trade unions and bargain collectively on working conditions. Child labor, forced labor and discrimination on the shop floor are not acceptable. A good personnel policy can enhance the value of an investment.</P><H4>Safe ports</H4><P>LBC Tank Terminals amended its safety policy after we had suggested this. Following a fatal accident in the Port of Rotterdam in 2014, the oil and chemicals bulk storage company made central arrangements for safety regulations that apply to all ports where it has operations.
A new three-year program should ensure that its safety performance is better than at similar companies. A special management committee, on which we are represented, will monitor this. During a visit to the LBC site in Antwerp, one of our specialists saw how the safety regulations are being applied.</P><H4>Engaged employees</H4><P>APG, along with supermarket chains Ahold and Sainsburyâs, contributed to an investorsâ manual for the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) to encourage retail chains to be more open about their personnel policy. According to the PRI, satisfied and engaged employees are good for a business as they stay longer and on average are more productive. The investors who drew up the PRI manual want retail chains to give more information on, for example, staff turnover and training.</P><P>The Indian hotel chain Lemon Tree, of which APG owns about 15%, has won the Asian Human Capital Award. The company (twenty-five hotels in sixteen towns) received the award since it actively employs people who are deaf or hard of hearing, or have Downs syndrome. About 11% of the chainâs 3,200 staff are people with physical or learning disabilities. Four years ago this was 6%. The Asian Human Capital Award is made each year to two companies in Asia with an innovative personnel policy that sets an example
to other companies.</P><H4>Good work in the clothing and textile sector</H4><P>We discussed sustainability performance with a fashion brand we invest in through one of our private equity funds. This brand came bottom of a Dutch NGOâs list because it provided no information at all on working conditions in its clothing factories or its environmental policy. Since we, as an investor (limited partner), have no direct contact
with the companies in our private equity funds, we made a visit with the manager (general partner). After we had established that the company does much more than it discloses, it said it would publish more.</P><P>At our suggestion, clothing company H&amp;M contacted a factory in Burma which subcontracted work to a company not on the list of approved suppliers on the H&amp;M site.
APG found out about the supplier at the end of 2014 during a working visit to clothing factories in Burma and Bangladesh. H&amp;M, which is in the lead internationally in providing information on its factories and suppliers, tightened its internal procedures. It also organized a workshop for its factories in Burma on why it is so important to be transparent about the companies involved in clothing production.</P><P>We also spoke to the Spanish fashion group Inditex (parent of Zara and other companies) and the Chinese company Li &amp; Fung about tighter supervision of working conditions in the production chain.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""vvb-item"" id=""gedrag-en-cultuurverandering""><DIV class=""typo""><H2>Conduct and culture change</H2><P>Metal and commodities company Glencore published its policy on corruption, signed up to the principles in the UN Global Compact, reviewed its internal code of conduct and announced an external board evaluation. APG had been in discussion with the Swiss-British company on these and other subjects for some years. We will continue to talk to Glencore, which generates a large part of its revenues from coal mining, about how it is responding to <mark>climate change</mark> and monitoring safety at work.</P><P>Oil company Cobalt has issued its first sustainability report. This American company was accused of corruption in its activities in Angola and was investigated by the American judicial authorities and the regulator, the SEC. Although it is still currently managing them, Cobalt has since sold its Angolan assets and so runs fewer risks.</P><H4>Culture change at Volkswagen</H4><P>We have urged Volkswagen to work on a change of culture following the scandal with the âdefeat softwareâ it used to manipulate the <mark>CO2</mark> emissions of its diesel cars in the United States. A more open culture is needed to hold the companyâs senior managers more accountable for inappropriate behavior and strategy. We also want Volkswagen to find new directors who can operate more independently.</P><P>APG is also in talks with companies about their corporate governance to stay ahead of issues. At our request, Chinese real estate company Dalian Wanda set up a whistle-blowersâ scheme and appointed a chief financial officer with responsibility for the financial policy of the rapidly-growing Wanda Group, which includes cinemas, shopping centers and a yacht builder.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""vvb-item"" id=""bestuurders-met-oog-voor-aandeelhouders""><DIV class=""typo""><H2>Directors with an eye for shareholders</H2><P>We attach great value to a properly functioning board with a varied composition, a clear division of executive and super-visory duties and sufficient independent directors who safeguard the interests of minority shareholders such as pension funds.</P><H4>European Shareholder Rights Directive</H4><P>Following pressure from us, the European Parliament rejected a proposal in the new Shareholder Rights Directive to grant additional rights to investors who have held the shares in their portfolio for at least two years. Along with other institutional investors, we set out our objections to the European Commission and the European Parliament. The final Shareholder Rights Directive, which is expected to be adopted in 2016, is a step in the right direction, since for example investors everywhere will soon be able to vote on remuneration policies. The directive is unlikely to have significant effects in the Netherlands.</P><H4>Unequal voting rights in France and Italy</H4><P>We and other investors have asked seventy-one French companies to prevent long-term shareholders receiving double voting rights. The Florange law, which came into force in 2014, means that these rights are granted automatically to investors who have held shares in a company continuously for two years unless that company explicitly decides not to implement this (an opt-out). We are against double voting rights as they give some shareholders disproportionate control. They also allow the French government to sell a large proportion of its shareholdings without losing influence. A majority voted in favor of an opt-out at nineteen of the twenty-five companies prepared to put a resolution to their shareholders. This strengthened our position as a shareholder.</P><P>We made a similar request to the 100 largest Italian listed companies. Unlike in France, double voting rights are not automatic in Italy but since 2014 it has been possible for
a company to put such a resolution to its shareholders (an opt-in). Despite our request, seven of the companies approached did put an opt-in on the agenda and the resolution was passed in all cases.</P><H4>Swedish corporate governance code</H4><P>We believe it is important that individual directors can be held accountable so we asked the committee overseeing the revision of the Swedish corporate governance code to end the practice of shareholdersâ meetings voting on all directors together in a joint resolution. Along with other investors we wrote to forty Swedish companies to request that directors stand individually. In early 2016, a number of companies (telecoms company Ericsson, Swedbank and Handelsbanken) said they will do this. The committee does not currently want to accept our request. We will continue to urge this.</P><H4>Guidance for company boards in Japan</H4><P>The Japanese government has introduced a corporate governance code that APG and other investors had been advocating for years. The code will contribute to a change of culture that will make companies more transparent and pay greater attention to minority shareholders. Along with other institutional investors, we visited ten companies to examine how they are applying the code. Discussions were held on this with the Japanese financial markets regulator and the government pension fund, which, as the largest pension fund in the world, can exercise huge influence.</P><P>Nine of the thirty-three large Japanese companies we wrote to, explaining why we wanted to see a third of the members of their directors being non-executives, have increased the independence on their board. This is a major step in a country where non-executive directors were unknown until recently. Japan is our principal Asian market, in ninth place on a list of countries where we invest, just above China.</P><H4>Discrimination against non-Japanese investors</H4><P>We voted against the introduction of new shares with guaranteed proceeds and voting rights at the shareholdersâ meeting of Toyota Motor Corporation. These âAA sharesâ would only be available to Japanese investors. APG was against this since it was excluded as a foreign investor and could be put at a disadvantage as a holder of normal shares. The request to remove this resolution from the agenda was not honored.</P><H4>Controversial merger in South Korea</H4><P>We voted against the merger of Korean companies Samsung Construction &amp; Trading and Cheil (advertising and marketing). The reason for this was that Cheil wanted to pay far too little for the shares in Samsung Construction &amp; Trading, which, like Cheil, has close ties with Samsung Electronics. APG as a shareholder would lose some â¬21 million as a result. As over two-thirds of the shareholders agreed to the acquisition by Cheil, the merger went ahead.</P><P>During a subsequent enquiry into this matter by the Korean parliament, our Asian corporate governance specialist explained why we voted against the merger, while the Korean civil service pension fund NPS voted in favor. APG had announced in advance in local and international media (New York Times, Bloomberg Business News) why it was against the merger. In early 2016, the Samsung Group announced that it will strengthen the independence of the boards of its subsidiaries.</P><H4>Approved financial statements</H4><P>We wrote to twenty-two South Korean companies asking them to distribute the financial statements approved by the auditors before the shareholdersâ meeting. In Korea it is usual only to issue provisional figures in advance and to present the final figures at the meeting itself. This is not practical for us as we usually vote remotely and have to approve the boardâs policy in advance of the meeting. We have been working on this for over two years. About ten companies have now complied with our request.
We will write to the others again in 2016.</P><H4>Sound remuneration policy</H4><P>As in 2014, we looked critically at the remuneration of the directors of the companies in our equities portfolio.
In 2015, we voted on over 1,730 remuneration resolutions at some 1,600 shareholdersâ meetings. We voted slightly more often against (54%) than in favor (45%). We cast
the same percentage of votes against in 2014, when we abstained slightly more often. The main reasons for voting against were excessively generous severance packages, inadequate links between payment and performance, and opaque schemes. Resolutions linking pay to challenging performance that makes a sufficient contribution to the strategic long-term targets of a company could in general rely on our support.</P><H4>Greater shareholder influence</H4><P>Ahold withdrew a proposal to reduce the number of members of its management board from three to two. A resolution to make this possible was removed from the agenda of the shareholdersâ meeting after we urged this. Ahold wanted to place responsibility with executives just below board level. These executives are not supervised by the supervisory board or elected by the shareholders.</P><P>We supported resolutions to allow shareholders to nominate directors (proxy access) at some eighty shareholdersâ meetings in the United States. In the Netherlands, holders of at least 3% of the shares are already able to nominate candidates for the board. Companies in the United States have resisted this for some time out of fear of shareholders with detrimental intentions. Several companies, including pharmaceutical company Pfizer, General Electric and DTE Energy, introduced proxy access last year after we had raised the subject with them.</P><P>American real estate company, Vornado (with several stores in the center of New York) announced it would listen more to its shareholders. For years, the company was
run by directors who had not received a majority at shareholdersâ meetings. Shareholdersâ resolutions to change the board structure were passed but not followed by the board. From 2018, Vornado directors who do not receive a majority of votes must offer their resignation to the other directors (who will then decide).</P><H4>Clear divisions between executives and supervision</H4><P>After we (and other investors) had urged this, Bank of America (BoA) submitted its plan to unite the roles of chairman and CEO to its shareholders for approval. Before the financial crisis, both roles were held by the same person at BoA. They were separated after shareholder pressure. This year the company wanted to return to the old situation without asking the shareholdersâ approval. We are not only against one person having both the role of CEO and of chairman but also believe that a company may not reverse a decision of its shareholders without consulting them. BoA obtained the support of a majority of the shareholders at a special shareholdersâ meeting although there was a substantial minority (40%) against. We wrote setting out our objections against combining the roles once again and will return to this in 2016.</P><H4>More independence and more female directors</H4><P>We have been discussing the membership of the board of British property company Derwent London, which owns many office blocks in the center of London, for some years. Only a third of the companyâs directors were independent in 2013. Last year, after it appointed more independent directors this had grown to half.</P><P>Talks have been held with several French companiesÂ about the need to have more women on boards. French legislation states that 40% of directors must be women from 2016. Vacancies cannot be filled until this percentage is reached. We are not currently aware of any companies where a problem has arisen because they have been unable to find suitable candidates.</P><H4>New governance structure after dubious transaction</H4><P>After sharp criticism from APG and others, Hyundai Motor Company altered its board structure, setting up a separate governance committee just below the board specifically
to monitor the interests of minority shareholders. An independent director has also been appointed. Both have a clear role in major investment decisions.The criticism from the shareholders, which we expressed at the shareholdersâ meeting in March, was prompted by the purchase of an expensive piece of land in the Seoul district of Gangnam after which the share price fell sharply. APG believed that the roughly $10 billion spent on this should have been distributed to the shareholders.</P><H4>Voting on appointments of directors</H4><P>Overall we voted on over 18,000 directors at over 2,600 shareholdersâ meetings in 2015, supporting almost 85% of the nominations. We voted against 9% of the candidates who, for example, were not sufficiently independent or already held too many directorships. We abstained or no vote was submitted in 6% of cases.

Commodity prices are influenced by a number of external factors, including the supply of and demand for commodities, speculative activities by market participants, global political and economic conditions, related industry cycles and production costs in major producing countries.</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""dy"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN style=""FONT-STYLE: italic""><SPAN class=""eo"">Comments - </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""eo"">A significant downturn in the price of commodities generally results in a decline in our profitability and could potentially result in impairment and balance sheet constraints. It is especially harmful to profitability in the industrial activities, which are more directly exposed to price risk due to the higher level of fixed costs.</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">The dependence of the Group (especially our industrial business) on commodity prices, make this the Group's foremost risk. See the Chief Executive Officer's review on page 4 and the financial review on page 52.</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Any economic developments, particularly impacting China and other fast growing countries, could lead to reductions in demand for, and consequently prices of, commodities.</SPAN></P><P class=""fv""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN style=""FONT-STYLE: italic""><SPAN class=""eo"">Mitigation - </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""eo"">A</SPAN><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN><SPAN class=""eo"">Diversification of our portfolio of commodities, geographies, currencies, assets and liabilities.</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Government policy decisions can be very important, e.g. in reducing the demand for coal or increasing it's pricing (via <mark>carbon</mark> taxes) - see Emissions and <mark>climate change</mark> below. New or improved energy production or technologies can also reduce the demand for some commodities such as coal.</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Also see our longer-term viability analysis above and the business review on page 60.</SPAN></P><P class=""fw""><SPAN class=""ec"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fu""><SPAN class=""di"">2.Â Â Â  Fluctuations in the supply of, or demand for, the commodities in which we operate</SPAN></P><P class=""fw""><SPAN class=""ec"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN style=""FONT-STYLE: italic""><SPAN class=""eo"">Risk appetite - </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""eo"">Low. Although an inherent risk in the extractive and marketing industries, we seek to ensure this risk is minimised through scale of operations and diversity of product.</SPAN></P><P class=""fw""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN style=""FONT-STYLE: italic""><SPAN class=""eo"">Risk - </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""eo"">We are dependent on the expected volumes of supply or demand for commodities which can vary for many reasons, such as competitor supply policies, changes in resource availability, government policies and regulation, costs of production, global and regional economic conditions, demand in end markets for products in which the commodities are used. These also include technological developments, e.g. commodity substitutions, fluctuations in global production capacity, global and regional weather conditions, natural disasters and diseases, all of which impact global markets and demand for commodities. Furthermore, changes in expected supply and demand conditions impact the expected future prices (and thus the price curve) of each commodity.</SPAN></P><P class=""fv""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN style=""FONT-STYLE: italic""><SPAN class=""eo"">Comments - </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""eo"">Future demand for certain commodities might decline (fossil fuels), whereas others might increase (such as copper, cobalt, and nickel for their use in electric vehicles and batteries), taking into consideration the &quot;greening&quot; of the global economy.</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">This risk is currently prevalent in various commodities, such as steel, coal and oil. In particular, many analysts believe that demand for coal will reduce sooner than previously expected due to significant cost reductions in renewable capacity and greater efficiencies from coal power plants.</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Also see Emissions and <mark>climate change</mark> below.</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Market price responses to such changes are neither instantaneous nor perfectly calibrated nor can the sustained implementation of such policies be certain.</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN style=""FONT-STYLE: italic""><SPAN class=""eo"">Mitigation - </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""eo"">Diversification of our portfolio of commodities, geographies, currencies, assets and liabilities.</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Making sure we are prepared for the shift in commodity demand by putting a special focus on the parts of the business that will potentially grow with the anticipated increase of electric vehicles and battery production and closely monitor fossil fuel (particularly thermal coal) demands.</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">See the Chief Executive Officer's review on page 4 and the business review on page 60.</SPAN></P><P class=""fw""><SPAN class=""dy"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fu""><SPAN class=""dn"">3.Â Â Â  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""dh"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN style=""FONT-STYLE: italic""><SPAN class=""eo"">Risk appetite - </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""eo"">Low. Where possible foreign exchange exposure to non operating foreign exchange risk are to be hedged.</SPAN></P><P class=""fv""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN style=""FONT-STYLE: italic""><SPAN class=""eo"">Risk - </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""eo"">The vast majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars, while operating costs are spread across many different countries, the currencies of which fluctuate against the U.S. dollar. A depreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar against one or more of these currencies will result in an increase in the cost base of the relevant operations in U.S. dollar terms.</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">The main currency exchange rate exposure is through our industrial assets, as a large proportion of the costs incurred by these operations is denominated in the currency of the country in which each asset is located. The largest of these exposures are to the currencies listed on page 61.</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN style=""FONT-STYLE: italic""><SPAN class=""eo"">Comments - </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""eo"">Currency fluctuations tend to move in symmetry with those in commodity prices and supply and demand fundamentals as noted above, such that decreases in commodity prices are generally associated with increases in the U.S. dollar relative to local producer currencies and vice versa. If this occurs then it is detrimental to us through higher equivalent U.S. dollar operating costs at the relevant operations. This negative, however, would usually be offset to some extent by the increases in commodity prices which had caused this change.</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN style=""FONT-STYLE: italic""><SPAN class=""eo"">Mitigation - </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""eo"">In respect of commodity purchase and sale transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, the Group's policy is usually to hedge the specific future commitment through a forward exchange contract. From time to time, the Group may hedge a portion of its currency exposures and requirements in an attempt to limit any adverse effect of exchange rate fluctuations.</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fu""><SPAN class=""dn"">4.Â Â Â  Geopolitical risk</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""ec"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN style=""FONT-STYLE: italic""><SPAN class=""eo"">Risk appetite - </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""eo"">High. We operate in countries with less developed political regimes. To be considered a truly diversified commodities group, operations in these jurisdictions are required.</SPAN></P><P class=""fv""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN style=""FONT-STYLE: italic""><SPAN class=""eo"">Risk - </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""eo"">We operate and own assets in a large number of geographic regions and countries, some of which are categorised as developing, complex or having unstable political or social <mark>climate</mark>s. As a result, we are exposed to a wide range of political, economic, regulatory, social and tax environments. The Group transacts business in locations where it is exposed to a risk of overt or effective expropriation - resource nationalism continues to be a challenging issue in many countries. Our operations may also be affected by political and economic instability, including terrorism, civil disorder, violent crime, war and social unrest.</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Increased scrutiny by governments and tax authorities in pursuit of perceived aggressive tax structuring by multinational companies has elevated potential tax exposures for the Group.</SPAN></P><P class=""fv""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN style=""FONT-STYLE: italic""><SPAN class=""eo"">Comments - </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""eo"">Policies or laws in the countries in which we do business may change in a manner that may be adverse for us, even those with stable political environments e.g. many governments have sought additional sources of revenue by increasing rates of taxation, royalties or resource rent taxes.</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">We have no control over changes to policies, laws and taxes.</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">The OECD tax reporting initiative on Base Erosion and Profit Sharing (BEPS) is now effective and in 2018 the Group will report for the first time with regard to the 2017 tax year.</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">The continued operation of our existing assets and future plans are in part dependent upon broad support, our ''social licence to operate'', and a healthy relationship with the respective local communities - see further Community Relations and Skills availability and retention concerning workforce disputes.</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN style=""FONT-STYLE: italic""><SPAN class=""eo"">Mitigation -</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN><SPAN class=""eo"">The Group's industrial assets are diversified across various countries. Also, the Group continues to actively engage with governmental authorities in light of upcoming changes and developments in legislation and enforcement policies.</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">See map on page 3 which sets out our global operational footprint.</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">In 2017, we also published our second Payments to Governments report. This detailed total government contributions in 2016 of around $4 billion. We also continue to be an active member of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fu""><SPAN class=""dn"">5.Â Â Â  Laws, regulations, enforcement, permits and licences to operate</SPAN></P><P class=""fw""><SPAN class=""ec"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fx""><SPAN style=""FONT-STYLE: italic""><SPAN class=""eo"">Risk appetite - </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""eo"">Medium. The Group maintains programmes which seek to ensure that we comply with or exceed the laws and external requirements applicable to our operations and products. However, some of our industrial activities are located in countries that are categorised as developing, complex or having political or social <mark>climate</mark>s and/or where corruption is generally understood to exist.</SPAN></P><P class=""fy""><SPAN class=""dg"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fz""><SPAN style=""FONT-STYLE: italic""><SPAN class=""dz"">Risk - </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""dy"">We are exposed to extensive laws including those relating to bribery and corruption, sanctions, taxation, anti-trust, financial markets regulation, environmental protection, use of hazardous substances, product safety and dangerous goods regulations, development of natural resources, licences over resources, exploration, production and post-closure reclamation, employment of labour and occupational health and safety standards and preservation. The terms attaching to any permit or licence to operate may also be onerous and obtaining these and other approvals, which may be revoked, can be particularly onerous to comply with. Furthermore, in certain countries title to land and rights and permits in respect of resources are not always clear or may be challenged.</SPAN></P><P class=""fz""><SPAN class=""dz"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fz""><SPAN class=""dz"">The legal system and dispute resolution mechanisms in some countries may be uncertain so that we may be unable to enforce our understanding of our rights. Successful lawsuits based upon damage resulting from operations could lead to the imposition of substantial penalties, the cessation of operations, compensation and remedial and/or preventative orders. Moreover, the costs associated with legal compliance, including regulatory permits, are substantial and increasing. Any changes to these laws or their more stringent enforcement or restrictive interpretation could cause additional significant expenditure to be incurred or cause suspensions of operations and delays in the development of industrial assets. Failure to obtain or renew a necessary permit or the occurrence of other disputes could mean that we would be unable to proceed with the development or continued operation of an asset and/or impede our ability to develop new industrial properties.</SPAN></P><P class=""fz""><SPAN class=""dz"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fz""><SPAN class=""dz"">As a diversified sourcing, marketing and distribution company conducting complex transactions globally, we are exposed to the risks of fraud, corruption, sanctions breaches and other unlawful activities both internally and externally. Our marketing operations are large in scale, which may make fraudulent or accidental transactions difficult to detect. In addition, some of our industrial activities are located in countries, such as the DRC, where corruption is generally understood to exist. Corruption and sanctions risks remain highly relevant for businesses operating in international markets as shown by recent regulatory enforcement actions both inside and outside the resources sector.</SPAN></P><P class=""ga""><SPAN class=""dg"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fp""><SPAN style=""FONT-STYLE: italic""><SPAN class=""eo"">Comments - </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""eo"">Since 2007 the Group has had various business dealings with entities associated with Dan Gertler in connection with its copper assets in the DRC. In December 2017 the United States government designated Dan Gertler and affiliated companies as Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs), thereby imposing blocking sanctions on them and companies owned 50% or more by them, under Executive Order 13818, titled &quot;Blocking the Property of Persons Involved in Serious Human Rights Abuses or Corruption&quot;. The Group has pre-existing contractual obligations to make royalty and pas-de-porte payments in respect of KCC and Mutanda to certain of these companies which pre-date the SDN designation and which arose when the companies acquired rights from Gecamines. The Group has not made any payment to the companies since the SDN designation. The Group is still considering how best to mitigate its risks in relation to these obligations.</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">In January 2018, the DRC parliament adopted a revised Mining Code. This includes significant increases in royalties, taxes, government ownership requirements and repatriation restrictions and terminates retroactively the 10-year stability clause that exists in the current Mining Code. If the revised Mining Code is promulgated and implemented in this form, it would have a significant impact on the investments of the Group in the DRC and their value.</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">During the year, a restatement of past financial statements at Katanga Mining Limited, a subsidiary of the Group, was required and the Ontario Securities Commission is investigating various matters relating to Katanga (see pages 92 and 97).</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">As KCC (Katanga's 75% held main operating subsidiary) did not rectify a capital deficiency by 31 December 2017 as required by DRC corporate laws, an interested party may commence legal action before DRC judicial authorities. Katanga continues to assess options to address the capital deficiency including options which may partially adversely impact its entitlement to KCC's future cash flows.</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN style=""FONT-STYLE: italic""><SPAN class=""eo"">Mitigation -</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""eo"">Â </SPAN><SPAN class=""eo"">We seek to ensure full compliance through our commitment to complying with or exceeding the laws and external requirements applicable to our operations and products and through monitoring of legislative requirements, engagement with government and regulators, and compliance with the terms of permits and licences. We keep informed of new regulations and legal requirements. We seek to manage the risk of breaching applicable laws and external requirements through our policy framework which is described on page 91. However, there can be no assurance that such policies, procedures and controls will adequately protect the Group against fraud, corruption, sanctions breaches or other unlawful activities.</SPAN></P><P class=""fw""><SPAN class=""ec"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fu""><SPAN class=""dn"">6.Â Â Â  Liquidity risk</SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN class=""ec"">Â </SPAN></P><P class=""fq""><SPAN style=""FONT-STYLE: italic""><SPAN class=""eo"">Risk appetite - </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=""eo"">Low.

However, the EUâs study, which uses emissions and output data relating to the 2012-14 period, examines emissions from agricultural output as a whole.</P><P class=""no_name"">A spokesman for the Department of Agriculture said: âWhile greenhouse gas productivity per euro is a widely-accepted indicator at international level to monitor green growth, it is not a measure of a typical <mark>carbon</mark> footprint per unit of agricultural output, and so should not be interpreted to mean we are the least <mark>climate</mark> efficient.â</P><P class=""no_name"">The EU study suggested most countries, including Ireland, were managing to combine higher productivity in agriculture with a lower <mark>carbon</mark> footprint, albeit with varying degrees of success.</P><P class=""no_name"">It also noted that Irelandâs per capita expenditure on agricultural research and development was considerably higher than other member states.</P><P class=""no_name"">The findings come in the wake of the Governmentâs draft strategy to cut Irish emissions, published by Minister for Communications, <mark>Climate</mark> Action and Environment <A class=""search"" href=""/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Denis+Naughten"">Denis Naughten</A> last month. </P><P class=""no_name"">The plan acknowledges that Ireland is currently not on track to meet its so-called â<mark>carbon</mark> budgetsâ for 2020 and 2030, partly because emissions from agriculture, Irelandâs largest <mark>carbon</mark> emitter, âare likely to flatline at bestâ.</P><P class=""no_name"">The EU findings coincide with a recent policy document by the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA), which suggest that if Irish agricultural emissions cannot be reduced, other sectors such as transport would be required to make âunrealisticâ reductions. </P><P class=""no_name"">According to the reportâs author, <A class=""search"" href=""/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Joseph+Curtin"">Joseph Curtin</A>: âIn this scenario the transport sector would be required to reduce its total emissions between 2020 and 2030 by at least 40 per cent if the agriculture sector cannot make a greater contribution to Irelandâs <mark>carbon</mark> budgetâ. </P><P class=""no_name"">The IIEA analysis suggests that just focusing on technical fixes in agriculture is insufficient, and that the structure of Irish agriculture also needs to be looked at. âThe heavy reliance on suckler beef systems in particular,â Mr Curtin said, âis neither economically nor environmentally <mark>sustainable</mark> in a post-milk quota and <mark>carbon</mark>-constrained world.â</P><P class=""no_name"">âSaying that we have efficient beef systems is like saying that we have the most efficient coal plants in the EU, but ignoring that there are much more economically beneficial and <mark>sustainable</mark> ways to produce electricity,â he said. </P><DIV class=""shareToolsBottom"" id=""share-base""><DIV class=""addthis_sharing_toolbox""><DIV class=""more-tools more-tools--hidden""><DIV class=""more-tools--custom""><A class=""print social-icons-Print gtm-event"" data-evt-category=""Social Tools"" data-evt-action=""Print on Social Tools menu"" data-evt-label=""/business/agribusiness-and-food/irish-agriculture-the-least-<mark>climate</mark>-efficient-in-europe-study-finds-1.3032584"" onclick=""location.href='							/business/agribusiness-and-food/irish-agriculture-the-least-<mark>climate</mark>-efficient-in-europe-study-finds-1.3032584	?mode=print&amp;ot=example.AjaxPageLayout.ot'"" value=""Print this page"">Â </A><A class=""rss social-icons-RSS gtm-event"" data-evt-category=""Social Tools"" data-evt-action=""RSS on Social Tools menu"" data-evt-label=""/business/agribusiness-and-food/irish-agriculture-the-least-<mark>climate</mark>-efficient-in-europe-study-finds-1.3032584"" href=""/cmlink/activecampaign-business-digest-opinion-1.3174693"" target=""_blank"">Â </A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

are destroying the environment and causing serious <mark>climate</mark> damage in Latin
America. The report describes the destruction caused by three European corporations,
which it says is typical of the damage caused by multinationals throughout the
continent. </P><P>âMultinational corporations
are relentlessly expanding their operations into ever more vulnerable and
remote regions of the world,â says the report, written by three public-interest
groups: the Democracy Centre of San Francisco, the Corporate Europe Observatory
of Brussels and the Transnational Institute of Amsterdam. The corporations
under the spotlight are the Spanish fossil-fuels giant Repsol, the Swiss-based
mining and resources conglomerate Glencore-Xstrata and Enel-Endesa, an Italian
consortium. </P><P>In the case of Repsol, it
says that âthe relentless pursuit of new gas and oil reserves in Peru takes
direct aim at the regionâs indigenous territories and forests, leaving social
destruction and environmental decimation in its wakeâ. Of the copper-mining
operations of Glencore-Xstrata , it claims: âScarce water resources, already
stretched by <mark>climate change</mark>, are being contaminated with impunity.â And it says
Enel-Endesa is attempting via its Latin American subsidiary Emgesa to portray a
massive hydro-electric dam as a âclean energyâ project, yet ârather than
benefitting local people, the electricity is destined for dirty industry at
discount pricesâ.</P><H2><STRONG>Hardship</STRONG></H2><P>The results in Latin
America of such poor corporate behaviour are environmental damage, overuse of
water resources, increasingly high <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and often hardship for
indigenous communities.Â But most developing-world governments are not
capable of forcing corporations to be more respectful of the environment and
<mark>climate</mark>. And nor, back in Europe, are corporations held accountable for what they
do in developing countries.</P><P>
The Latin Americans lose in three ways: their <mark>climate</mark> and environment are
severely damaged, they have to pay for their <mark>carbon</mark> surpluses and practically
all the profits from intrusive mega-projects go back to rich countries. This

are âinvadingâ every country in Latin America. In particular, Spanish
corporations have become so well known for their numerous and ambitious
development projects that they are often called the âcorporate conquistadorsâârecalling
how the Spanish conquered much of Latin America centuries ago, in search of
gold, silver and cheap labour.</P><P>
Repsolâone of the largest of the many Spanish companies involvedâis criticised
for extracting natural gas from the middle of Peruâs delicate rainforest, with dozens
of drilling platforms, hundreds of kilometres of pipelines and other
infrastructure.Â The report says Repsol is to expand further,Â âat the
cost of <mark>devastation</mark> of indigenous communities and their cultures, as well as
the destruction of forests, biodiversity and water resources&quot;.</P><P>In another part of Peru,
the southern Andes, the mining activity of Glencore-Xstrata is putting âextreme
pressureâ on the water supply, says the report. The lives of indigenous
communities are closely tied to a hundred lakes and four river basins. In 2009,
dangerous levels of contamination led to miscarriages, deformations and deaths
among livestock in the area. Independent studies showed the company had
polluted the water supply with heavy metals such as arsenic. Harsh and
sometimes violent confrontations have taken place but still local citizens are
at risk.</P><P>
The report claims powerful multinational corporations manage to overcome
resistance to their damaging environmental practices by infiltrating a
countryâs political process, making promises that are never met, or by simply
ignoring local opposition.</P><H2><STRONG>Indigenous impact</STRONG></H2><P>

appealÂ </A>Â for
UN leaders and national governments to address the damage suffered by their
communities. âDue to global warming, our people are suffering a constant
variation of the <mark>climate</mark>,â said Klaus Quicque Bolivar, who lives in the
Peruvian Amazon. âThere is an excess of heat. The rivers are warming up; there is
less agricultural production and natural reproduction of fishes. Some animal
species are disappearing and the cycles of wild fruits are varying.â </P><P>

But
many indigenous participants expressed concerns about whether their views would
be included in the final document. While the indigenous community had its say
during a brief session, delegates from the multinational corporate sector were
getting much more attention and were busy lobbying national government
delegates at the conference, to adopt industry-friendly solutions to fight
<mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>
If the outcome of this UN <mark>climate</mark> conference is anything like others held in
recent years, the recommendations of the indigenous community will receive only
token acknowledgement in the final communiquÃ©âan outcome sure to remind them of
what itâs like to fight powerful corporations in their own countries.</P><P>
COP 20 concludes tomorrow. Participating countries hope to be able to produce a
document of agreements that will be the basis for a final accord to be signed
in Paris a year from now.

  14 June 2016
    | <A href=""/article/categories/13-against-the-grain"">Against the grain</A>, <A href=""/article/categories/537-land"">Land</A></P></DIV><P>Â </P><P><STRONG><EM>Eight years after releasing its first report on land grabbing, which put the issue on the international agenda, GRAIN publishes a new dataset documenting nearly 500 cases of land grabbing around the world.</EM></STRONG></P><P>
	In October 2008, GRAIN published a report called âSeized: the 2008 land grab for food and financial securityâ. It exposed how a new wave of land grabbing was sweeping the planet in the name of addressing the global food and financial crises. âOn one handâ, we wrote, ââfood insecureâ governments that rely on imports to feed their people are snatching up vast areas of farmland abroad for their own offshore food production. On the other hand, food corporations and private investors, hungry for profits in the midst of the deepening financial crisis, see investment in foreign farmland as an important new source of revenue.â<A href=""#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1"" title="""">[1]</A> In the annex to the 2008 report, we documented more than one hundred cases of these new and emerging land deals that, until then, had been buried in the business sections of newspapers like the Vientiane Times and the Sudan Tribune. Little did we know that by merely pulling the news clips and analysis together, the report would trigger a tsunami of global media attention, social activism and political struggleânot to mention corporate headaches.</P><P>
	Eight years later, we went back to look at the dataâthe myriad reports of land grabbing for food production that we have been following and assessing. Over the past several years, GRAIN staff and allies in different regions have been tracking media and other information sources on a daily basis and posting reports on land grab developments to the open-publishing platform <A href=""http://farmlandgrab.org/"">farmlandgrab.org</A>. We used this website as the basis for constructing this dataset, which holds 491 land deals covering over 30 million hectares spanning 78 countries.<A href=""#_edn2"" name=""_ednref2"" title="""">[2]</A> This new research shows that, while some deals have fallen by the wayside, the global farmland grab is far from over. Rather, it is in many ways deepening, expanding to new frontiers and intensifying conflict around the world. We hope this updated dataset will be useful tool for movements, communities, researchers and activists fighting against land grabbing and defending community-based food systems.</P><P><STRONG>Eight years later: overall assessment</STRONG></P><P>
	The big picture view that we draw from this exercise is disturbing. First of all, the emerging new trend we wrote about in 2008 has continued and become worse. While most countries are not currently experiencing the extreme price hikes in basic foodstuffs that triggered riots from Haiti to Egypt back in 2008, prices remain stubbornly high and access to food is a daily struggle for most people.<A href=""#_edn3"" name=""_ednref3"" title="""">[3]</A> Today, that situation is compounded by the mounting impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>. Harvest losses due to extreme weather have become so acute in places like the southern Philippines that farmers are in the streets begging for food and getting killed for it.<A href=""#_edn4"" name=""_ednref4"" title="""">[4]</A> We now have even more evidence that <mark>climate change</mark> is caused not just by burning coal and oil for transport and energy, but by the industrial food system itself and the corporate quest for profits that drives its expansion. Indeed, <mark>climate change</mark> and land grabs are inextricably linked.</P><P>
	Some of the most egregious land deals we witnessed over the past several years have since backfired or failed for different reasons. In 2009, public outrage over the 1.3 million hectare Daewoo project in Madagascar helped bring down the government leading to the suspension of the deal. In 2011, the assassination of Libyan leader Mouamar Gaddafi put an end to his regime's 100,000-hectare rice project in Mali. Other large-scale deals have been scaled back. In Cameroon, for example, after much protest, the Herakles deal was slashed from 73,000 to 19,843 hectares. Some deals have morphed into less direct forms of land takeover. In Brazil and Argentina, for instance, Chinese companies facing concerns about foreigners grabbing land have tried to work out deals to secure the production from farms rather than purchasing the land themselves. Increasingly, such deals are being labelled âresponsible investmentsâ, but they are still, in many ways, land grabs.<A href=""#_edn5"" name=""_ednref5"" title="""">[5]</A></P><P>
	While some of the worst land grabs have been shelved or toned down, a number of new deals are appearing, many of which are âhard-coreâ initiatives to expand the frontiers of industrial agriculture. We say hard-core because these deals are large, long-term and determined to avoid the pitfalls that earlier deals ran into. Much of the Asian-led oil palm expansion in Africa, and the advance of pension funds and trade conglomerates to secure access to new farmlands, fall into this category.<A href=""#_edn6"" name=""_ednref6"" title="""">[6]</A> Increasingly, gaining access to farmland is part of a broader corporate strategy to profit from <mark>carbon</mark> markets, mineral resources, water resources, seeds, soil and environmental services.</P><P>
	As land deals rise and fall, policymakers and corporate boards are hard at work trying to facilitate their success. Instead of the wild land rush of before, we now have multiple &quot;frameworks&quot; and &quot;guidelines&quot; on how to conduct these deals while minimising social and environmental costs. All of these new rules are voluntary, however, and do more to obfuscate the problem than to solve it. Many argue that the heightened political attention around land grabbing has helped bring land and agrarian reform back into public debates in parliaments and other legislative fora. But the main objective of regulatory processes is still to formalise land markets and titles, which experience tells us will lead to further concentration of land in the hands of few.<A href=""#_edn7"" name=""_ednref7"" title="""">[7]</A></P><P>
	On the positive side, one thing that has changed radically compared to eight years ago is the level of resistance and mobilisation these deals have triggered. People are now more informed and taking action like never before. There are numerous coalitions and campaigns against land grabbing operating at local, national and regional levels. In many places, these struggles are converging, bringing together farmers, migrant groups, fisherfolk, indigenous peoples, pastoralists and others. These movements are developing new strategies to challenge corporations and governments and building international solidarity.</P><P>
	Meanwhile, journalists and other media workers have become important allies in getting the word outâoften at great peril to their personal safety. As resistance to land grabbing grows, the difficulties and dangers of engaging in this work are intensifying. Activists are detained and imprisoned; journalists are harassed with libel cases and even killed; and peasant and indigenous leaders are routinely murdered. But this challenging, courageous work is crucial if we are to turn the tide of land grabbing and corporate-led agriculture and create a thriving global movement for food justice and food sovereignty.</P><P><STRONG>What exactly does the data tell us?</STRONG></P><P>
	Our first land grab dataset in 2008 exposed about 100 initiatives, launched by both governments and corporations, many of which were still in an exploratory phase at the time.<A href=""#_edn8"" name=""_ednref8"" title="""">[8]</A> In 2012, we updated the dataset to reach 400 projects covering 35 million hectares.<A href=""#_edn9"" name=""_ednref9"" title="""">[9]</A></P><P>
	The 2016 dataset documents 491 large-scale land grabs taking place over the past decade. The deals cover over 30 million hectares of land in 78 countries. This means that the number of land deals is continuing to grow, but the growth has slowed since 2012. In particular, several of the largest âmegaâ projects have collapsed, resulting in a decline in the total number of hectares. The problem, however, is not going away.</P><P>
	As with our previous datasets, this is not an exhaustive list of land deals and, as such, is not representative of the full scale of land grabbing around the world. It draws mainly from the <A href=""http://farmlandgrab.org/"">farmlandgrab.org</A> website and accounts for only those deals that:</P><UL><LI>
		were initiated after 2006,</LI><LI>
		are led by foreign investors,</LI><LI>
		are for the production of food crops and</LI><LI>
		involve large (&gt; 500 hectares) areas of land.</LI></UL><P>
	Below are the main conclusions we have gleaned from this new and improved dataset, though we also expect and encourage others to analyse the data for themselves.Â </P><P><EM><STRONG>Despite many failed deals, the problem is real</STRONG></EM></P><P>
	The shock of the early years of the global farmland grab has subsided. Gone are news reports of diplomats shuttling in from Gulf countries to sign deals for half a million hectares with poor, agriculture-based countries. Gone are many of the opportunistic businessmen peddling farmland investments in faraway countries to pension fund managers. Gone, too, are a number of companies that signed serious deals for tens or even hundreds of thousands of hectares, with ambitions to become top multinational agribusiness companies.</P><P>
	The Indian-owned Siva Group, for instance, amassed a farmland portfolio of nearly one million hectares for oil palm plantations in only a few years. The company is now facing bankruptcy proceedings in the Seychelles. In another example, Foras, the private sector arm of the Islamic Development Bankâwhich was on its way to acquiring 700,000 hectares of farmland across Africa for a massive rice projectâhas vanished. Even Karuturi, whose 300,000-hectare concession in Ethiopia made him a poster child of the new farm owners, now has nothing to show for it. His flower business in Kenya has been liquidated and his Ethiopian farms have been sitting idle for the past two years.</P><P>
	We culled 126 failed deals and placed them in a separate table. The large number of abandoned projects attests to the frenzy that erupted in 2008, much of which eventually backfired. Whether due to incompetence, hubris, inexperience or poor planning, their collapse helps to explain why the growth in farmland deals has slowed since 2012 and why the overall number of hectares has declined.</P><P><EM><STRONG>The food security agenda is still a factor driving farmland deals</STRONG></EM></P><P>
	On the heels of a global food price crisis, the initial wave of farmland deals was driven largely by âfood securityâ concerns. Much of the media attention on the early negotiations emphasised the geopolitics with images of wealthy sheiks taking over the lands of poor and hungry peasants in Mali or Pakistan in order to export food back to their home countries. Our new database complicates this early view somewhat, as a number of todayâs land grabs involving companies from China, Japan or the Gulf states have little to do with the food security agendas of their home governments.</P><P>
	The quest for food security has not, however, disappeared completely from the land grabbing story. Despite early difficulties, Gulf governments are still promoting overseas farming and building or buying farms abroad. Hassad Food, for instanceâthe agribusiness arm of Qatarâs sovereign wealth fund and one of the pioneering Gulf firms in overseas farmingâis even starting to worry about competition for available farmland.<A href=""#_edn10"" name=""_ednref10"" title="""">[10]</A> Anyone who doubts the seriousness of the Gulf companies should watch the latest video put out by UAE-based Jenaan Investment on its new farm in Sudanâwhich is gigantic, high tech and fully operational.<A href=""#_edn11"" name=""_ednref11"" title="""">[11]</A></P><P>
	China, Japan and South Korea have also maintained official policies on overseas farming as part of their food security agendas. This mainly translates into support for their national corporations, which are not only acquiring lands overseas for farming but, just as importantly, securing control over trading routes to ship commodities back home and compete with the big Western multinationals on global markets. Africa remains a small, albeit important, part of food security-driven land grabbing, though these companies are currently focused on more accessible areas like Brazil and Australia.</P><P><EM><STRONG>Agribusiness expansion is the main objective</STRONG></EM></P><P>
	While the food security hype has died down, plain old profit-driven agribusiness expansion is now the dominant agenda. The new database provides a stark picture of this, with companies integrating their operations both vertically and horizontally. Food corporations like Chinaâs COFCO are expanding by getting more deeply engaged in farming itself. In addition, more companies are getting into agribusiness and more finance is flowing in. Geographically, plantations are expanding into new territories.</P><P>
	Oil palm plantations alone are responsible for a large portion of land grabs in the food and agriculture sector in the last few years. Much of this expansion is led by Asian conglomerates like Wilmar, Olam and Sime Darby, which are carving out massive chunks of territory in Africa, as well as Latin America, East Asia and the Pacific. Governments play a key role here. They are building infrastructure, revising regulations and entering into new âpublic-private partnershipsâ that facilitate private sector investment in agriculture, including farmland acquisitions. They are also signing new trade and investment agreements and aid packages aimed at facilitating the expansion of agribusiness.</P><P><EM><STRONG>The financial sector is a big player</STRONG></EM></P><P>
	Several of the early players from the financial sector have by now vanished, and others have fallen extremely short of their initial projections. The New York-based hedge fund Galtere is a good example. In 2010 it announced it was setting up a US$1 billion farmland fund. Galtere bought a couple of farms in Brazil and then dropped off the map.</P><P>
	But new players from the financial sector are popping up all the time. Most have their sights on profiting from the real heavy weights among institutional investors: pension funds. The last few years have seen a spectacular rise in farmland investments by pension funds.<A href=""#_edn12"" name=""_ednref12"" title="""">[12]</A> In 2008, only a few pension funds were investing in farmland. By 2012, several more were showing interest. Today the number has ballooned. Pension funds are the source of much of the capital behind companies buying farmland globally. Some, such as the US-based TIAA-CREF, are even running their own farming operations.</P><P>
	Another key set of players from the financial sector is the development finance institutions (DFIs), the for-profit cousins of national development aid agencies. Farmland companies still have a hard time raising funds from the private sector, as farmland is viewed as a risky investment, so they turn to DFIsâmany of which have adopted âagribusiness investmentâ as their main vision for agricultural development. Without the involvement of these agencies, which are investing in land grabs using taxpayer money, there would be significantly fewer deals in our database.</P><P><EM><STRONG>Offshore and illicit finance underpin these deals</STRONG></EM></P><P>
	Offshore structures and illicit financial flows play an important role in todayâs farmland grab. Had we listed the origin of the foreign investors according to where they are registered, tax havens like the Cayman Islands or Singapore would rank as top land grabber countries! Nearly all the companies grabbing land in Mozambique, for instance, are registered in Mauritius. While they may be legal, such offshore structures can conceal corruption, hide the true owners and allow companies to avoid paying taxes.</P><P>
	Communities and organisations on the ground are often the first to notice that companies acquiring farmland are not much interested in agriculture and appear to have been set up for entirely different purposesâsuch as money laundering, tax evasion or to con people out of their savings. For example, African Land Limited of the UK, which ran a scheme to sell farmland in Sierra Leone, was found guilty of misleading investors. Local farmers and pastoralists in Senegal have long suspected the company Senhuile of money laundering.<A href=""#_edn13"" name=""_ednref13"" title="""">[13]</A> The Kenya Revenue Authority for years pursued Karuturi, one of the largest farmland investors in Ethiopia, for transfer pricing in its flower operations there.<A href=""#_edn14"" name=""_ednref14"" title="""">[14]</A> Unsurprisingly, several farmland investors are found in the Panama Papers, such as Russian billionaire Rashid Sardarov who bought large tracts of land in Namibia.<A href=""#_edn15"" name=""_ednref15"" title="""">[15]</A></P><P>
	Proving the link between farmland investment and corruption or criminality is not easy, of course.<A href=""#_edn16"" name=""_ednref16"" title="""">[16]</A> In Colombia, the governmentâs own Court of Audits estimates that drug traffickers owned nearly half of the countryâs farmland.<A href=""#_edn17"" name=""_ednref17"" title="""">[17]</A> In Romania, the courts have chased numerous investors for tax evasion and money laundering. More recently, several deals entered into by Dutch Rabobank in Romania were investigated for forgery and fraud. The French government even has its eyes on hot money coming into the countryâs wine industry. Seeing land grabbers put behind bars, however, is a rare occurrence.</P><P>
	With offshore and illicit finance so tightly connected to farmland investing, we are increasingly led to the conclusion that âdue diligenceâ is a farceâit is easy to claim, but often proves hollow. In Cambodia, the Thai sugar giant Mitr Phol persistently boated about its standards of excellence, all the while being accused of illegally confiscating thousands of hectares from rural communities. In 2015, the company finally withdrew from its plantations and the EU and Cambodian governments are now trying to audit the concessions. In Peru, the Czech-led Plantaciones de Pucallpaâmember of the Roundtable on <mark>Sustainable</mark> Soy, which requires due diligence of its membersâwas linked to massive deforestation and human rights abuses and finally ordered to cease operations.<A href=""#_edn18"" name=""_ednref18"" title="""">[18]</A> Just in the past year, Rabobank and TIAA-CREF, perhaps the most esteemed and supposedly responsible farmland investors in the world, were exposed for land grabbing. Despite their lofty claims of due diligence, both Rabobank and TIAA-CREF were found to be buying lands from crooked businessmen known for using fraud and corruption to amass lands in Romania and Brazil, respectively.</P><P><EM><STRONG>Narrower geography</STRONG></EM></P><P>
	The geographic scope of foreign investment in farmland has narrowed in the new database. Only a few deals have gone forward in some of the major initial targets such as Mali, Senegal, South Sudan, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines and Argentina. In Latin America, companies very active a few years ago in multi-country land deals such as El Tejar, Calyx Agro (Louis Dreyfus) and Cresud struggled to achieve profitability and eventually pulled out. Attention has now turned to countries where agribusiness is already established and the legal environment favours foreign investors and exports (e.g. Australia) and countries where the export infrastructure is being built and large areas of land can be cheaply obtained (e.g. Mozambique). As a result, there is less farmland investment buzz in Asia and the Americas in the current database, while the prominent regions are Africa, Eastern Europe and the Pacific.</P><P>
	There are also overtones of a colonial carve-up in the creation of these new frontiers as certain countries favour investments in specific regions. Japanese companies, backed by their government, are focusing on northern Brazil and Mozambique for soy production. Chinese companies are aggressively buying farmland in New Zealand and Australian, as well as Russiaâs far east. Russiaâs western farmland is a favourite destination of European companies, as are Romania and the Ukraine. Indian companies are keen on Ethiopia. French and Portuguese companies favour their former colonies in Africa. (US and UK companies, however, are pretty much everywhere.)</P><P><EM><STRONG>Farmland grabs are also water grabs</STRONG></EM></P><P>
	The global farmland grab remains as much about water as it is about land.<A href=""#_edn19"" name=""_ednref19"" title="""">[19]</A> With a few exceptions, land deals in the database include access to water. In many of the cases for which we have been able to see the legal agreementsâas in Mali, Senegal and Cameroonârights to water and access to water are explicitly guaranteed in the text. This does not mean that land deals only occur where water is abundant, however. A frightening number of water guzzling operations are being erected in water conflict zones (e.g. along the Nile), upstream from water dependent communities (e.g. the Lurio River project in Mozambique) or on top of non-renewable underground reserves (e.g. Sudan). When drought hits, as it did in much of Asia and Africa in the first half of 2016, communities living next to these plantations see their access to water evaporate. This is what is currently happening in communities living next to the new sugarcane plantations in Cambodia and Ethiopiaâs Lower Omo Valley.</P><DIV style=""border: 1px solid; padding: 5px; background-color: rgb(244, 244, 252);""><P style=""text-align: center;""><STRONG>GRAIN vs. the Land Matrix?</STRONG></P><P>
		There are a number of other databases on what are sometimes calledâin depoliticised languageâ&quot;large-scale land acquisitions&quot;. Currently, the most well known is the Land Matrix,<A href=""#_edn20"" name=""_ednref20"" title="""">[20]</A>Â which was initiated by the International Land Coalition. The Land Matrix is maintained by professional researchers working at five institutions in Europe. It frequently uses farmlandgrab.org as a source and, like farmlandgrab.org, is fairly comprehensive.</P><P>
		There are several differences between the Land Matrix and GRAIN's database. The Land Matrix's data is updated daily and changes every day. Deals being revised are also taken offline for a period of time. This makes the data in the Land Matrix something of a moving target. What you find there today, you won't necessarily find there tomorrow. GRAIN's dataset, by contrast, is a fixed snapshot of a given point in time.</P><P>
		The Land Matrix database also has broader coverage and slightly different definitions. It's true that you can filter out the Land Matrix deals that correspond most to what GRAIN covers (transnational land grabs for food production, above a certain size) if you want to compare the two. But there are still discrepancies. For example, GRAIN includes biofuel projects (except those growing jatropha) as food deals because we know that sugarcane, maize and palm oil may end up in the food chain depending on commodity prices at harvest time or other factors. The Land Matrix, while recognising the flexible role of these crops, categorises such deals separately.</P><P>
		But we are not far apart when it comes to the big picture. In early 2016, the Land Matrix included about 1,100 deals representing 38 million hectares, of which the vast majority (74%) were for food and agriculture.<A href=""#_edn21"" name=""_ednref21"" title="""">[21]</A>Â GRAIN's new dataset includes 491 deals covering roughly 30 million hectares, exclusively for food and agriculture.</P></DIV><DIV>Â </DIV><DIV><STRONG>Cause for hope: resistance is growing</STRONG></DIV><P>
	The data we have today shows how far and how fast agribusiness is expanding. It also highlights how inefficient these investments are in the sense of how little they do to resolve rural poverty or make a dent in global hunger. But most importantly, it shows the tremendous resistance growing to counteract these deals. In case after case, we see staunch opposition to these investments from local communities and the organisations that support them. The resistance stems from conflicting claims over land and territories and arises as companies tear down forests, dig up burial sites, fence off pastoral zones and pollute the air and water. It grows as security forces clash with communities and as lawyers harass civil society, activists and journalists. It often becomes fatal and leaves people traumatised. The pressure behind these deals is intense and the stakes are very high for all involved.</P><P>
	Groups around the world have launched campaigns to stop the financing of land grabs at the source, whether from the World Bank, European governments, pension funds or shareholders in major corporations. Some of these efforts have been successful at stopping loans (e.g. to Calyx Agro in Latin America) or in making the case for divestment (e.g. Ecoenergy in Tanzania), while others are still trying to influence the halls of power (e.g. the governments invested in Feronia in the DRC). Some groups focus on legal work, whether it's challenging land grabbers in court (e.g. Wilmar) or creating public political space (e.g. through African churches or parliaments) to rewrite rules in favour of communities and get them enforced. This kind of work is gaining momentum from Ethiopia to Sierra Leone as activists learn to tap into legal resources and support groups and use crowdfunding tools to raise awareness and support for jailed community leaders and their families.</P><P>
	Resistance is also growing as barriers between different frontline struggles are breaking down. In Senegal, for example, farmersâ organisations are supporting pastoralists who are the first affected by certain projects. In Mali, urban groups displaced by industrial development projects are now the first to travel to rural areas to help farmers defend their lands. Similarly, communities in different countries where the same corporation is taking control of land (e.g. Dominion Farm), are getting together to learn from and support each other, sometimes through well structured alliances (e.g. around Socfin/BollorÃ©). People are also engaging in more cross-sector struggles, for example creating solidarity between those fighting biofuel initiatives and those fighting mining projects.</P><P>
	Resistance against land grabs is at the forefront of many of today's struggles for social, political and economic transformation, putting corporations and governments colluding complicit with land grabbing on the defensive. This makes it all the more critical to avoid traps like that of âresponsible investmentâ. We have to keep the focus on reversing the expansion of agribusinessâstopping the problem at its root. As this new research shows, the global farmland grab is massive and it is extending its reach to new frontiers. We must redouble our resistance efforts to ensure that more lands can stay under the control of food producing communities.</P><P><STRONG>Going further</STRONG></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

For one thing, that  loaf can be  âreadâ as if it were a core sample extracted from the heart  of a grim global economy. Looked at another way, it reveals some of the  crucial fault lines of world politics, including the origins of the Arab  spring that has now become a summer of discontent.</P><P>Consider this: Between June 2010 and June 2011, world grain prices <A href=""http://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/wfs-home/foodpricesindex/en/"" target=""_blank"">almost doubled</A>.  In many places on this planet, that proved an unmitigated catastrophe.   In those same months, several governments fell, rioting broke out in  cities from Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, to Nairobi, Kenya, and most  disturbingly, three new wars began in Libya, Yemen, and Syria. Even on  Egyptâs Sinai Peninsula, Bedouin tribes are now in revolt against the  countryâs interim government and manning their own armed roadblocks.</P><P>And in each of these situations, the initial trouble was traceable,  at least in part, to the price of that loaf of bread.  If these  upheavals were not  âresource conflictsâ in the formal sense of the term,  think of them at least as bread-triggered upheavals.</P><P><STRONG>Growing <mark>Climate Change</mark> in a Wheat Field </STRONG></P><P>Bread has classically been known as the staff of life. In much of the  world, you canât get more basic, since that daily loaf often stands  between the mass of humanity and starvation.  Still, to read present  world politics from a loaf of bread, you first have to ask: of what  exactly is that loaf made? Water, salt, and yeast, of course, but mainly  wheat, which means when wheat prices increase globally, so does the  price of that loafâand so does trouble.</P><P>To imagine that thereâs nothing else in bread, however, is to  misunderstand modern global agriculture.  Another key ingredient in our  loafâcall it a  âfactor of productionââis petroleum.  Yes, crude oil,  which appears in our bread as fertilizer and tractor fuel.  Without it,  wheat wouldnât be produced, processed, or moved across continents and  oceans.</P><P>And  donât forget labor.  Itâs an ingredient in our loaf, too, but not  perhaps in the way you might imagine.  After all, mechanization has  largely displaced workers from the field to the factory. Instead of  untold thousands of peasants planting and harvesting wheat by hand,  industrial workers now make tractors and threshers, produce fuel,  chemical pesticides, and nitrogen fertilizer, all rendered from  petroleum and all crucial to modern wheat growing.  If the labor power  of those workers is transferred to the wheat field, it happens in the  form of technology. Today, a single person driving a <A href=""http://www.deere.com/en_US/ProductCatalog/FR/series/planting_seeding/air_seeders_carts/air_hoe_drill_series.html"" target=""_blank"">huge $400,000 combine</A>,  burning 200 gallons of fuel daily, guided by computers and GPS  satellite navigation, can cover 20 acres an hour, and harvest 8,000 to  10,000 bushels of wheat in a single day.</P><P>Next, without financial capitalâmoneyâour loaf of bread wouldnât  exist. Itâs necessary to purchase the oil, the fertilizer, that combine,  and so on. But financial capital may indirectly affect the price of our  loaf even more powerfully<EM>.</EM> When there is too much liquid  capital moving through the global financial system, speculators start to  bid-up the price of various assets, including all the ingredients in  bread.  This sort of speculation naturally contributes to rising fuel  and grain prices.</P><P>The final ingredients come from nature: sunlight, oxygen, water, and  nutritious soil, all in just the correct amounts and at just the right  time.  And thereâs one more input that canât be ignored, a different  kind of contribution from nature: <mark>climate change</mark>, just now really  kicking in, and increasingly the key destabilizing element in bringing  that loaf of bread disastrously to market.</P><P>Â </P><P><STRONG>Marketing Disaster</STRONG></P><P>When these ingredients mix in a way that sends the price of bread  soaring, politics enters the picture.  Consider this, for instance: The  upheavals in Egypt lay at the heart of the Arab Spring.  Egypt is also  the worldâs single largest wheat importer, followed closely by Algeria  and Morocco. Keep in mind as well that the Arab Spring started in  Tunisia when <A href=""http://voices.washingtonpost.com/political-economy/2011/01/spike_in_global_food_prices_tr.html"" target=""_blank"">rising food prices</A>,  high unemployment, and a widening gap between rich and poor triggered  deadly riots and finally the flight of the countryâs autocratic ruler  Zine Ben Ali. His last act was a vow to reduce the price of sugar, milk,  and breadâand it was too little too late.</P><P>With that, protests began in Egypt and the Algerian government  ordered increased wheat imports to stave off growing unrest over food  prices.  As global wheat prices <A href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/5f6f94ac-b6bc-11df-b3dd-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1S6vv1TY5"" target=""_blank"">surged</A>  by 70 percent between June and December 2010, bread consumption in Egypt  started to decline under what economists termed  âprice rationing.â And  that price kept rising all through the spring of 2011.  By June, wheat  cost 83 percent more than it had a year before. During the same time frame,  corn prices surged by a staggering 91 percent.  Egypt is the worldâs fourth-largest corn importer. When not used to make bread, corn is often  employed as a food additive and to feed poultry and livestock. Algeria,  Syria, Morocco, and Saudi Arabia are among the top 15 corn importers. As  those wheat and corn prices surged, it was not just the standard of  living of the Egyptian poor that was threatened, but their very lives as  <mark>climate</mark>-change driven food prices triggered political violence.</P><P>In Egypt, food is a <A href=""http://www.slate.com/id/2283217?nav=wp"" target=""_blank"">volatile political issue</A>.  After all, one in five Egyptians live on less than $1 a day and the  government provides subsidized bread to 14.2 million people in a  population of 83 million. Last year, overall food-price inflation in  Egypt was running at more than 20 percent. This had an instant and devastating  impact on Egyptian families, who spend on average 40 percent of their often  exceedingly meager monthly incomes simply feeding themselves.</P><DIV class=""pullquote-right"">World Bank President Robert Zoellick fretted that the global food system was âone shock away from a full-fledged  crisis.â</DIV><P>Against this backdrop, World Bank President Robert Zoellick <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/01/business/global/01food.html"" target=""_blank"">fretted</A>  that the global food system was âone shock away from a full-fledged  crisis.â  And if you want to trace that near full-fledged crisis back to  its environmental roots, the place to look is <mark>climate change</mark>, the  increasingly extreme and devastating weather being experienced across  this planet.</P><P>When it comes to bread, it went like this: In the summer of 2010,  Russia, one of the worldâs leading wheat exporters, suffered its worst  drought in 100 years. Known as the Black Sea Drought, this extreme  weather triggered fires that burnt down vast swathes of Russian forests,  bleached farmlands, and damaged the countryâs breadbasket wheat crop so  badly that its leaders (<A href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/aea76c56-6ea5-11e0-a13b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1S6vv1TY5"" target=""_blank"">urged on</A>  by western grain speculators) imposed a year-long ban on wheat exports.   As Russia is among the top four wheat exporters in any year, this  caused prices to surge upward.</P><P>At the same time, massive flooding occurred in Australia, another  significant wheat exporter, while excessive rains in the American  Midwest and Canada damaged corn production. Freakishly massive flooding  in Pakistan, which put some 20 percent of that country under water, also  spooked markets and spurred on the speculators.</P><P>And thatâs when those <mark>climate</mark>-driven prices began to soar in Egypt.    The ensuing crisis, triggered in part by that rise in the price of our   loaf of bread, led to upheaval and finally the fall of the countryâs   reigning autocrat Hosni Mubarak.  Tunisia and Egypt helped trigger a   crisis that led to an incipient civil war and then western intervention   in neighboring Libya, which meant most of that countryâs production of   1.4 million barrels of oil a day went off-line. That, in turn, caused   the price of crude oil to surge, at its height hitting $125 a barrel,   which set off yet more speculation in food markets, further driving up   grain prices.</P><P>And recent months havenât brought much relief.  Once again,   significant, in some cases record, flooding has damaged crops in Canada,   the United States, and Australia. Meanwhile, an unexpected spring   drought in northern Europe has hurt grain crops as well. The global food   system is visibly straining, if not snapping, under the intense   pressure of rising demand, rising energy prices, growing water   shortages, and most of all the onset of <mark>climate</mark> chaos.</P><P>And this, the experts tell us, is only the beginning.  The price of   our loaf of bread is forecast to increase by up to 90 percent over the next 20   years. That will mean yet more upheavals, more protest, greater   desperation, heightened conflicts over water, increased migration,   roiling ethnic and religious violence, banditry, civil war, and (if past   history is any judge) possibly a raft of new interventions by imperial   and possibly regional powers.</P><P>And how are we responding to this gathering crisis? Has there been a   broad new international initiative focused on ensuring food security  for  the global poorâthat is to say, a stable, affordable price for our  loaf  of bread?  You already know the sad answer to that question.</P><P>Instead, massive corporations like Glencore, the worldâs largest   commodity trading company, and the privately held and secretive Cargill,   the worldâs biggest trader of agricultural commodities, are moving to <A target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.agrimoney.com/news/louis-dreyfus-a-potential-target-for-glencore--3313.html"">further consolidate</A>   their control of world grain markets and vertically integrate their   global supply chains in a new form of food imperialism designed to   profit off global misery.  While bread triggered war and revolution in   the Middle East, Glencore made windfall profits on the surge in grain   prices. And the more expensive our loaf of bread becomes the more money   firms like Glencore and Cargill stand to make. Consider that just about   the worst possible form of  âadaptationâ to the <mark>climate</mark> crisis.</P><P>So what text should flash through our brains when reading our loaf of   bread? A warning, obviously.  But so far, it seems, a warning ignored.</P><P><EM>Christian Parenti, author of the just-published </EM><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/1568586000/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20"">Tropic of Chaos: <mark>Climate Change</mark> and the New Geography of Violence</A><EM> (Nation Books), is a contributing editor at </EM>TheNation magazine<EM>,   a Puffin Foundation Writing Fellow at the Nation Institute, and a   visiting scholar at the City University of New York.

Deby won the 1996 electionsâthe first multi-party elections held in Chadâas well as the 2001, 2006, and 2011 elections. The electoral processes during these elections have, however, been controversial.Â While the opposition contested the results each time, its voice became louder during the last elections as civil society organizations joined to protest austerity measures. Although the term of the current legislature ended in March 2015, Deby has announced a further postponement of parliamentary elections for &quot;budgetary reasonsâ.</P><P>Deby was sworn-in for a fifth term in August 2016 during a public ceremony attended by 14 heads of state. Earlier in 2016, a special criminal court in Dakar, Senegal, had found Chadâs former president, Hissene Habre, guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced him to imprisonment for life.</P><P><B>Economic Overview</B></P><P>Chad joined the list of oil-producing countries in 2003 and since then its economy has been heavily dependent on oil. The economy, previously agrarian, saw per capita GDP grow from about $220 in 2001/02 (less than half of the average in Sub-Saharan Africa) to approximately $1,024 in 2014.</P><P>However, the 2014 drop in oil price and the deterioration of the security situation led to a deeper recession in 2016, with poverty expected to rise to 39.8% by 2019. These changes reflect fiscal austerity and consequent cuts in public services, and loss of income caused by the disruption of cross-border trade in livestock. These trends were partially offset by modest increases in agriculture, which constitutes the primary sector of employment for nearly 3/4 of Chadâs working age population.</P><P>Despite severe fiscal adjustment, the overall fiscal deficit (cash basis) increased slightly from 4.4% of non-oil GDP in 2014 to 4.6% in 2016 financed primarily through treasury bonds in the regional debt market, IMF disbursement, and budget support from donors. A recent increase in domestic debt has led to risks in debt sustainability. Hard currency rationing and substantial fiscal consolidation have reduced the external current account deficit. However, Chadâs international reserves continue to fall, representing barely a monthâs worth of imports.</P><P><B>Short- and Medium-Term Outlooks</B></P><P>In the short-term, the government needs to raise more fiscal revenues while reducing expenditure. Prospects are difficult because oil prices remain low, export volumes constrained, and the government needs to repay the Glencore oil sales advances.</P><P>In the medium-term, the establishment of a stabilization fund, economic diversification, and ways to mitigate regional security risks, as well as providing military escorts to secure selected trade corridors that allow movement of goods and people, need to remain high on the agenda. Instability in oil revenue complicates fiscal management and budgetary planning. Regional instability is affecting economic activity by impacting trade, public expenditure, and private investment.</P><P><B>Social Context</B></P><P>In January 2015, Chadian troops joined Cameroonian and Nigerian to combat Boko Haram. Chad has been at the forefront of this operation to root out terrorism. Suicide bombings hit NâDjamena in June/July 2015, causing dozens of fatalities and injuries. Subsequent attacks have been sporadic.</P><P>As the military campaign continues, humanitarian issues have emerged. Chad is hosting about 400,000 refugees from Sudan, the Central African Republic (CAR), and Nigeria, all of whom represent about 4% of the countryâs population. Returnees and internally displaced people also need humanitarian assistance. Host communities have shared their land, food, and houses and hope to see their lives improved as well. The plight of these people is exacerbated by the <mark>climate</mark> as changing weather patterns worsen their fate.</P><P><B>Development Challenges</B></P><P>Chad is ranked 185 out of 188 countries, according to the 2015 United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Human Development Index (HDI). Many Chadians still face severe deprivation, with most of the Millennium Development Goals not met by 2015. Between 2003 and 2011, Chad achieved moderate but significant progress in poverty reduction, with the national poverty rate falling from 55% to 47%. However, with this current economic and financial crisis, poverty could increase. The absolute number of poor is projected to rise from 4.7 million to 6.3 million between 2012 and 2019.</P><P>Progress on non-monetary poverty presents a mixed picture, with gains in some areas offset by losses in others.<B>Â </B>According to the joint Demographic and Household Survey (DHS) and Multi-Indicators Clusters Surveys (MICS) undertaken in early 2015, infant mortality has decreased from 91% in 2005â2009 to 72% in 2010â2014. Child mortality has also decreased from 79% to 65%, while maternal mortality fell from 1,099 per 100,000 births to 860 per 100,000 births.</P><P>Last Updated:Â Apr 20, 2017</P></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></LI><LI class=""tab_wbr ""><DIV class=""tab-1 parsys""><DIV class=""gridlayout parbase section""><DIV class=""row ""><DIV class=""col-md-12  colsplit"" id=""""><DIV class="" ""><DIV class=""grid_12_par_0 parsys""><DIV style=""padding-left:0px;padding-right:20px;"" class=""remove-padding-grid""><DIV class=""redesign_static_content section""><SECTION id=""""><DIV class=""c14v1-body c14v1-body-text flipboard-keep ""><P><B>World Bank Group Engagement in Chad</B></P><P>Chad joined the World Bank in 1963.

But once the monsoons subsided, prices unexpectedly went through the roof. That was when dal prices hit the headlines in newspapers and dominated discussion on prime time television news. The union government swung into action â first by cracking down on hoarders and announcing that it would import more pulses and then, by increasing the minimum support price (MSP) of two major pulse crops in a bid to encourage farmers to grow more pulses. Gradually, the prices stabilised and the issue disappeared into the news hole, far from public memory.</P><P>It was only for those keeping a close eye on developments that the elements did not add up. In May 2015, just when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was completing a year in office, the government claimed that overall consumer price inflation had dropped to a four-month low and that wholesale price inflation had been negative for the previous six months. Only pulses bucked the trend. Even at the global level, there was either a close match or an excess supply of agri-commodities. So, was there a scam somewhere as many suspected?</P><P>Yes indeed, there was a scam. In fact, documents seized in October-December 2015 by officials in the income tax (IT) department in the Ministry of Finance and a subsequent appraisal report based on these records reveal that there was an insidious game at play, more than just the simplistic hoarding of pulse stocks at the wholesale or retail levels. The âAppraisal Report in the Case of Pulse Importers and Traders Groupâ of the IT department summed up the man-made crisis thus:</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""blurb""><P>The abnormal price situation in India was created by a coordinated collusive activity orchestrated by few trading and financial entities. The physical stocks of pulses (were) cornered in domestic and international markets. Significant long positions on the future were taken on exchanges to create an artificial scarcity at the wholesale and retail levels.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The Indian government did not take a position on the futures market for dal to control prices despite it being the largest importer. And this, according to the department was what transpired:</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""blurb""><P>Information was gathered that few major commodity dealers having presence in overseas markets as well created a monopolistic condition by procuring and hoarding stocks of pulses in national as well as overseas markets. They rigged domestic rates to an unprecedented level to offload their stock procured at low rate. The super profit earned in this manner was not offered to tax and siphoned off either abroad or converted into unaccounted cash through entry operators.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The profit was spread through the chain, from the importing wholesalers right down to the retailers and not just at the level of the hoarders. Tax officials discovered three types of operators who together worked as a cartel. Tier-I comprised leading commodity multinational corporations (MNCs) who could influence overseas markets. The second tier included domestic dealers who procured and hoarded local stock and offloaded stocks of the tier-I entities, while the third rung were entry operators who could provide bogus bills to reduce profit and evade taxes. The commodity MNCs shipped out the income to their overseas parent companies through over-invoicing of imports and under-invoicing of exports. Not only was there unbridled profiteering, the cartel members also avoided taxation. The IT officials have come up with the names of the individuals and companies involved:</P><P>â¢â<B>Tier I:</B>Â Glencore Group, ETG Group, Edelweiss Group</P><P>â¢â<B>Tier II:</B>Â Jindal Group comprising Dalip Jindal, Pradip Jindal, Jindal Agro, etc; Vikas Gupta, Superior Group; Manoj Agrawal; SV Agri Trade; Sharp Mint Group</P><P>â¢â<B>Tier III:</B>Â Manoj Agrawal, Riddhi Siddhi Impex, Parth International, Gayatri Maa, Gunn Enterprises, Charles India Private Limited</P><P>Other than Glencore and Edelweiss, another major importer of dal and violator was the Sharp Mint group which has been raided by the IT department forÂ a second time as far more serious tax and money âlaundering investigations are under way in its case, as also in the case of a major commodity exchange. Taken together â the IT department concurred in its reports that run into more than 2,100 pages â these were the bunch of individuals and companies responsible for the dal crisis that rocked India in October 2015. This writer is in possession of copies of the series of appraisal reports, even as the working of commodity exchanges is currently being investigated by the department. The main players mentioned in the reports were contacted for their responses which have been included.</P><P><B>Supply ShortagesÂ </B></P><P>The first signs of a dal price surge emerged in January 2015, in the aftermath of a below-normal monsoon. Prices of moong dal increased by Rs 500 per quintal, while tur dal prices went up by Rs 100 per quintal. Retail prices of all four main dals â <EM>moong, tur,Â uradÂ and masoor âÂ </EM>registered a 15-30% increase over the prices prevailing a year earlier. By the time Modi completed a year in office on 24 May 2015, retail prices of pulses had shot up by a disconcerting 64%. Urad dal at that time was being sold at Rs 105-123 per kg in metropolitan cities against Rs 64-80 a year earlier and for tur, the numbers were Rs 102-116 per kg as against Rs 68-86 per kg.</P><P>In July, union minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Ram Vilas Paswan said in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha, âOver the last one year, the increase in retail prices of major pulses have ranged between 12.63-40.73%. The main reason for the sharp increase in prices of pulses is a decline in production on account of adverse weather conditions.â</P><P>Pulses production for the 2014-15 crop year (JulyâJune) was estimated to fall to 18.43 million tonnes from 19.78 million tonnes in the previous year. The government planned to import more pulses to bridge the demand gap, but this was where there was a trap. India produces roughly 18-19 million tonnes of pulses annually but has to import an additional 3-4 million tonnes to meet domesticÂ demand, the bulk of this being done by private importers. This was where the clue lay. The government failed to hedge future imports with positions in the derivative market unlike in earlier years. Yet, this hole in the import basket was waiting to be exploited, even as there were murmurs that there was uncertainty about when the stocks would finally land on Indian shores. But when retail prices first topped Rs 150 a kg and then breached the Rs 200 mark, panic struck the government authorities.</P><P>On 14 October 2015, finance minister Arun Jaitley chaired a high-level inter-ministerial meeting that decided to create a buffer stock by procurement and imports of pulses, take strict action against hoarders and black marketers, besides encouraging states to lift stocks of imported pulses, among others. The government also amended the âcentral orderâ under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 on 18 October to enable imposition of stock limits on pulses sourced from imports, stocks held by exporters, stocks to be used as raw materials by licenced food processors and stocks of large departmental retailers.</P><P>Next came the much-publicised raids. Nearly 75,000 tonnes of pulses were seized from hoarders in raids across 13 states. The Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution said in a statement on 24 October,</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""blurb""><P>De-hoarding operations across the states continued. These have resulted in seizure of 74,846.359 Metric Tonnes (MT)Â pulses so far. Total 6,077 raids have been conducted by the states after the amendment in the Central Order under (the) Essential Commodities Act.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Two months later, raids were conducted on the offices of commodity traders and importers. Raids were also conducted at the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX) âto shortlist the data of traders indulging in speculative trading of pulses and delivery thereof.â On 29 December 2019,Â <I>India Today</I>Â reported, âEdelweiss, Glencore, ETG among other major trading houses are accused of working as a cartel, illegally holding stock, delaying imports, amplifying scarcity, [and] manipulating pricesâ (Kanwal 2015).</P><P>But surprisingly, the role of the multinational corporations, their cartel partners, and how they operated disappeared from the landscape with hardly a trace. The appraisal reports of the IT department reveal all that, and more. It took officials almost a year to make sense of the documents that were retrieved from the hard disks that were seized or impounded during the December 2015 raids. In all, 55 premises were searched under Section 132 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and 134 premises were surveyed under Section 133A. (The particular provisions of the act empowered IT officials to conduct search-and-seizure raids and surveys.)</P><P><B>Glencore: At the core of the issue</B></P><P>All threads of the market manipulation that led to the 2015 dal crisis can be tied to one of the worldâs largest integrated producer and marketer of commodities â Glencore public limited company. An Anglo-Swiss multinational corporation engaged in trading in agricultural commodities and minerals, Glencore (an acronym for Global Energy Commodity Resources) is headquartered in Baar, Switzerland with a registered office in Saint Helier, Jersey. Currently ranked 14th in the Fortune Global 500 list, it operates in India as Glencore Grain India Private Limited (GGIPL) with Pravin Raghuvir Dongre as its managing director. Dongre is also the managing director of another group company, Agricore Commodities Private Limited (ACPL). Both companies figured in the IT investigations. He is also chairman of the trade body, the Indian Pulses and Grains Association.</P><P>Tax officials recovered a number of documents that showed how Glencore was controlling operations. One excel sheet (XLS) showed how its Mumbai office was maintaining records of third-party sales to Jindal Agro. Another had records of SV Agri Tradeâs sales to one Rajesh Trading Company. Yet another XLS sheet aggregated tur dal sales of Glencore, SV Agri Trade and Jindal Agro International. Similarly, a text message from Glencore official Saurabh Bhartia was sent to Dongre in early October 2015. There were multiple text messages which mentioned the existence of a joint venture with the Jindals.</P><P>Glencore and the Jindals also traded through many Singapore-based companies. An XLS sheet recovered from one of the Glencore employees (named only as Khandelwal) showed that Glencore extended credit imports to its cartel members. These cartel members were allowed to import through Netherland-based Glencore Grain BV without having to pay for it. There were several files and mails wherein the stock position of cartel entities were aggregated and reported to the Singapore office of Glencore on a regular basis. Glencore executed many trades on behalf of its associate entities in overseas markets. Not all trades were settled through delivery. The profit or loss on account of trades settled without delivery was retained abroad by Glencore and utilised as per instruction of the individuals concerned. This was an issue of transfer pricing as the entities appeared to work at distances other than armâs length.</P><P>In fact, Glencore, which controls the Canada and Australia markets, was planning to operate through ETG (once Export Trading Group), a dominant player in commodities trading in Africa and Myanmar. There were several e-mails indicating that instead of competing with each other, they decided to enter into a partnership for gaining monopoly control over the Indian pulses market. Glencore was to pick up a 51% stake in ETG at a proposed payout of $162.81 million. With this, Glencore would have achieved backward integration by eliminating local millers. Multiple documents were also found from ETGâs office. The deal was to be closed in December 2015. On re-examining the accounts, the tax officials saw that despite recording turnover of thousands of crore rupees and despite being the dominant market force and a world leader, the Glencore Group hardly paid any taxes. The appraisal report noted that this</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""blurb""><P>â¦. is a sad commentary on tax compliance behaviour of a global giant who fleeced poor Indian consumers through monopolistic trades and robbed off the exchequer of its legitimate dues. Indulging in unethical, illegal and money laundering activities, [the] Glencore-led cartel seriously threatened the economic security of the country.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Tax officials reworked the accounts and discovered that these were in wide variance with the numbers recovered from the Glencore servers. For instance, for financial year 2010-11, they worked out the profit for GGIPL to be Rs 62.86 crore and the total taxes debited at Rs 7.42 crore. Therefore, the net profit before taxes for 2010-11 should have been Rs 70.29 crore. Instead, the companyâs audited results showed a loss of Rs 2.33 crore. The trend was similar for other years. Moreover, there were substantial differences between the closing stocks in the audit results and those found on the computers. The differences were due to over-invoicing of purchases and holding additional stock outside the books in lieu of the price difference. ACPLâs accounts were similarly manipulated. The net profits in 2015 alone (till November) came to Rs 53.91 crore, though ACPL had been consistently showing losses. Both companies also suppressed net profit of Rs 133.76 crore from trading in wheat, sorghum and other millets in 2015 alone, it was alleged.</P><P>One particular email showed how Glencore was manipulating profits in castor trading through Indore-based Nikhil Commodity &amp; Derivatives Private Limited. The numbers of four companies were mentioned in that mail with two of them mentioned only as âJTâ and âGL.â The cumulative profit and losses of the four companies came to a flat zero. Tax officials concluded that JT and GL wereÂ <I>benamiÂ </I>or front companies. Trading was done and positions taken on NCDEX through the âproâ accounts of brokers acting as a cartel. (Pro-trading is the act or process of buying, selling or exchanging commodities.) The profit earned was not shown in the books. There were regular email exchanges between Dongre and Bhartia through their Gmail accounts. The pro account positions did not appear in the books of the brokers as transactions of either ACPL or GGIPL but were camouflaged as that of the concerned broker himself, the IT departmentâs reports alleged. The accounts were squared off at the broker level.</P><P>In 2014-15 alone, GGIPL operated through five brokers and one XLS sheet showed how the net position of pulses for each month was squared off to zero. The total realised but undisclosed profit was Rs 2.13 crore. Similarly, a profit of Rs 1.55 crore was shifted out the previous year. Mails from Bhartia to Dongre also clearly mentioned the actual position of pulses as against the declared stocks. For instance, the difference between 6,310 metric tonnes of chana stocks in the last quarter of 2014 was worked out to be Rs 20.19 crore. It was alleged that profits were made from currency arbitrage (or the simultaneous buying and selling of currencies to take advantage of differing prices of the same asset). GGIPL made $32.4 million through currency arbitrage in January-April 2015, a mail to Dongre revealed.</P><P><B>Bigger games</B></P><P>The numbers at the international level were bigger. An analysis of mail accounts of key employees of Glencore revealed large-scale trading on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and Bursa Malaysia Berhad (BMD) exchanges. Indian citizens cannot legally trade in overseas markets even under the governmentâs Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS). Tax officials found that mails written by employees of ACPL and GGIPL were sent from India to the Rotterdam offices of Glencore Grain BV (and not the other way round). These were not transactions done by Glencore Grain BV that were being conveyed to its India office: in fact, these were transactions entered from India allegedly by employees of ACPL and GGIPL that were being communicated to the groupâs overseas offices. There were a large number of such mails giving details of trading done on CBOT and BMD. Tax officials worked out the profits: the total profits from 2010-11 to 2014-15 came to $9.44 million.</P><P>That there existed an arrangement to trade on the CBOT and BMD markets and to park profits thereon with Glencore, Rotterdam was evident from a draft email of Dongre. The mail to one Ronald de Gelder at the Rotterdam office talked about crediting profits to the India account. The agreed ratio of profit sharing was 50:50. However, as all transactions were done from India, the entire profit needed to be taxed in India, the IT department claimed in its appraisal reports. There was overwhelming evidence that GGIPL and ACPL were also earning income outside India which was credited to its India account through the desk maintained at the Rotterdam office of Glencore Grain BV, the department claimed. These details were frequently exchanged among officials of GGIPL and ACPL and Glencore officials in Rotterdam. This evidence was recovered from mails and their attachments from accounts bearing the name â@glencore.comâ and the Gmail account of Dongre. An important mail sent by him to de Gelder acknowledged and documented the profit-sharing and retention mechanism between GGIPL and Glencore Grain BV. Incidentally, these mails were in the draft folder; all important mails which are against local laws had been exchanged as âdraftâ mails. A part of GGIPLâs profit was allegedly retained at Rotterdam in violation of Indian laws. It was not offered for tax, and was reportedly a breach of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. The income earned outside India needed to be taxed in India irrespective of the sharing arrangement between Dongre at GGIPL and his counterpart at Rotterdam.</P><P>Other mails exchanged between Dongre and GGIPL director Shyam Doshi showed how the GGIPL profit was being calculated both in India and Rotterdam, apart from the fact that it was not being offered for tax in India. There were trades in both pulses and cotton. The IT officials concurred that the income of the Indian company being parked in Rotterdam needed to be taxed in India. The amount computed only on basis of what was seized came to $43.19 million between 2009-10 and 2014-15.</P><P><B>Adani connection</B></P><P>In 2008, Glencore plcâs subsidiary Chemoil Energy Limited and Adani Global Limited formed a joint venture (JV) Chemoil-Adani Pte Limited for supplying bunker fuel to vessels in Mundra and other ports in India, including Kandla, Jamnagar, Vadinar, Hazira, Dahej and Goa. The JV initially was to supply marine fuel at Mundra. Seized documents showed that sometime later Adani Global acquired 49,00,000 shares of the company. The directorsâ resolution towards this sale, however, bore no date. An email exchanged between Surish Sharma, who resigned as the director of Chemoil-Adani in the run-up to the sale, and another Glencore official, put the deal at $8 million. In addition to the amount received on sale of shares, Chemoil Energy was to receive another $8 million on sale of properties. According to the IT department, the transaction should have attracted capital gains tax in India notwithstanding that it was between two foreign entities and the transfer of shares entailed transfer of assets in India. Moreover, through GGIPL and ACPL, Chemoil Energy had a permanent establishment (PE) in India. Besides all this, the transaction was negotiated through GGIPL, Glencoreâs PE in India.</P><P>The second deal was over Delhi-based Tinna Viterra Trade Private Limited (TVTPL). Formed as Maple Newgen Trade Private Limited in early 2009, it was renamed later that year after Singapore-based Viterra Asia bought a 60% in the company. The JV existed till May 2013 when Glencore took over Viterra Inc globally, causing the exit of Viterra. The JV had been active in trading in agriculture commodities such as yellow peas, chick peas, wheat and other grains in the Indian market. After the dissolution, the entire shares were held by Tinna Rubber and Infrastructure Limited (TRIL) and its name was first changed to Tinna Trade Private Limited and then Tinna Trade Limited. According to a mail recovered from Dongreâs Gmail account, $10 million was payable to Viterra Asia Pte Limited, Singapore. However, Glencore plc was liable to be taxed in India since the underlying assets were located in India. In the end, TRIL paid the amount for the acquisition of shares at Rs 10 per share, that is, at par value. No tax was deducted at source (TDS) as no capital gains accrued to it in India being transfer of shares at par. The tax officials reworked the share value on basis of the companyâs balance sheet for 2012-13, to Rs 30.5 per share. Viterra Asia, therefore, made capital gains of Rs 6.30 crore, the IT department claimed.</P><P>A large number of mails and files were recovered from the premises of the Glencore group which related to its investment in ETC Agro Processing (India) Private Limited, part of the ETG group. In a mail sent to Doshi in March 2015, Dongre talked about joining hands with ETG to emerge as a dominant player in India. Even as the dal shortage was beginning to create turmoil in the country, Glencore and ETG discussed how to control this market. According to a file dated 7 September 2015 that was recovered from the premises of the ETG group, the $130 million deal would have Glencore as the single largest stakeholder at 40%. Even though officials of both groups denied any such transaction during the post-search interrogation, the capital gains of ETG and Glencoreâs funding sources are still being probed.</P><P><B>Fluctuations in retail prices</B></P><P>A Glencore spokesperson, in an emailed response to the<EM> EPW</EM>, denied any involvement or any role in the creation, abetment or compounding of the dal crisis. This is what was stated:</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""blurb""><P>We also unequivocally deny the allegations of forming any cartel with any individual or organisation. Anybody following the spike in dal prices would know that the price hikes were only in two categories of dals: tur and urad. We place on record that Glencoreâs core importation commodity in the pulses sector is masoor and yellow peas, which saw no such hike. Our importation of tur and urad are negligible. Therefore, we stand excused of any such charges â¦ Any close reading of the price fluctuations over the period under discussion will reveal that the entire burden of fluctuation and rise was at the retail end. As a major global producer and marketer of natural resources, our core role is to connect commodities from places of surplus to places where they are most required in an efficient, cost-effective, safe, reliable and responsible manner. We base our investment and operational decisions to a large extent on the fundamentals of supply and demand. Commodities are traded globally and this enables countries to import when domestic production volumes are insufficient to meet domestic demand. We also believe that it is very important price signals reach farmers; such price signals enable them to make decisions about the varieties and volumes of crops to grow that are based on their ability to generate the highest return.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The spokesperson attributed the dal crisis to the forces of supply and demand. âSubsequent market intervention by authorities in some states â albeit well-intended â inadvertently led to an exacerbation of the situation and a further rise in prices,â the spokesperson claimed and further argued:</P><P>â¢âAn acute shortage of tur and urad was caused by the monsoon failure in two consecutive years (2014 and 2015). Tur and urad are kharif crops and are dependent on the advent of rains in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. They are also early seeded crops, unlike soybeans, and any delay in the arrival of the monsoon has a direct proportional impact on final yields.</P><P>â¢âOutside of India, tur and urad are only produced in Myanmar and countries in East Africa. Both of these locations are dependent on rainfall as these pulses are mostly grown in rain-fed areas. As a result, the government was unable to buy sufficient stock â despite being aware of the acute shortage of tur â until the 2016 harvest crops from Myanmar and East Africa became available.</P><P>â¢âTur and urad have been delisted from futures trading on the exchange platform since 2007. This shows that higher prices cannot be attributed to speculation on commodities exchanges.</P><P>â¢âThe entire price rise was a result of attempts to artificially suppress prices in major pulses producing states of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. These states kept stock limits in place; these stock limits prevented farmers from selling their produce to domestic traders/millers. As a result, these farmers had to dispose of their pulses at substantially lower prices (at times even below their cost of production) at the time of harvest itself. This demotivated farmers to cultivate pulses, which resulted in lower acreage in following seasons. And these subsequent harvests were adversely impacted as a result of the failed monsoons.</P><P>The spokesperson also commented on the data/documents impounded from Glencoreâs premises during the raid: âWe have suitably responded to all the queries from the income tax department via our various submissions and also during personal deposition of our employees.â</P><P>The appraisal reports of the IT department made note of such submissions and depositions, but had found those to be insufficient or unsatisfactory explanation for the departmentâs findings.</P><P><B>ETG: Through tax havens</B></P><P>The operations of ETG and its financial details that were ferreted out by the IT department officials were similar. Founded in 1967 and purchased by its current directors in 1986, Export Trading Group (ETG) owns the most vertically integrated agriculture supply chain in Africa with operations in procurement, processing, warehousing, distribution and merchandising. It is also actively present in North America, India, China and Southeast Asia. The group has a substantial presence in India in markets for agricultural commodities. In this country, the group is headed by Vijay Bhupatrai Doshi. ETG is essentially a tax haven-based group with ultimate control with a British Virgin Islands (BVI)-based company. The main companies of the group in India are ETG Agro Private Limited, ETC Commodities (India) Private Limited, Greenfield Impex Private Limited, and ETC Agro Processing (India) Private Limited and ETG Agro Processing (India) Private Limited â the two acronyms ETG and ETC (Export Trading Company) should not be confused with each other.</P><P>The two entities that figured in the investigations â ETC Agro Processing (India) Private Limited and ETG Agro Private Limited â are subsidiaries of the ETG Group in India that are owned by Mahesh Patel and Ketan Patel, who own 60% and 50% stakes respectively in these two firms through the ETC Group, Mauritius. The rest of the shareholding in these companies is held by Vijay Doshi and his family members, Hemir V. Doshi, Mala Doshi and Heera Doshi. The first of the companies of the Doshi family that was investigated was Agro Ventures FZC that operates from the Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) Free Trade Zone in Dubai. The investigators examined files pertaining to Pacific Foods Limited (PFL) in Dubai, which was a joint venture of Parle Biscuits Private Limited (one of Indiaâs biggest companies manufacturing biscuits and other snack foods operating out of Vile Parle, Mumbai, which was set up by the Chauhan family in 1929); Export Trading Company, Dubai; and Agro Ventures, FZC, Dubai. PFL was incorporated in Dubai in April 2015 to set up biscuit manufacturing plants in Ethopia and Kenya. On examining its books, the tax officials concluded that Vijay Doshi and Hemir Doshi would have to explain the source of Rs 5.82 crore in 2015-16 and Rs 18.72 crore in 2016-17 that they had invested in PFL.</P><P>The second issue was over the tax accrued on the transfer of shares in ETC Agro. In the beginning, the Doshi and Patel families held shares in the ratio of 52.25:47.75. A company called Kiev Services BV then acquired 35% shares from the two families, which were left with 32.50% each. Shares of Kiev Services and Birju Patel (of the Patel family) were transferred to the ETC Group, Mauritius in March 2012. As per the then prevailing exchange rate, $3.8 million (of Kievâs shares) would be equal to Rs 19.38 crore and $3.52 million (Patelâs shares) would be worth Rs 17.99 crore. ETC Mauritius acquired 67.5% of shares before fresh allotment of shares brought down the percentage to 60%. According to the Finance Act, 2012, an asset or capital asset, being any share or interest in a company or entity registered or incorporated outside India shall be deemed to be situated in India if the share or interest derives, directly or indirectly, its value substantially from the assets located in India. Thus, capital gains on Rs 19.38 crore in the case of Kiev Services and Rs 17.99 crore in the case of Birju Patel was taxable in India, the IT department argued.</P><P>But both of these were incidental findings. The IT officials noticed that both ETC Agro and ETG Ago had not paid any advance tax in 2015 when the dal crisis was at its peak. The reasons given to the investigators were âshortage of fundsâ and âunpredictabilityâ over the previous two quarters (the raids were conducted in December 2015) because of which they expected a dip in profits. However, on examining the accounts, it was discovered that ETC Agro had a taxable income of Rs 30.83 crore while ETG Agroâs taxable income was Rs 37 crore till 30 November. On this, the IT departmentâs appraisal report remarked,</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""blurb""><P>Itâs in a position to easily shift its profits to Dubai and Singapore as it has been doing in past. Because of IT action in December 2015, assessee could not get time to manipulate its books and hence the admission. However, itâs quite likely that in the period December 2015 to March 2016, it would have booked losses again. AO (assessing officer) must verify these transactions in detail. If so, assistance of Delhi Investigation Wing may be sought.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>These remarks would have been in sync with what the officials found for the previous financial year. On a gross turnover of Rs 1,807 crore, the two companies in the ETC Group claimed to have incurred a loss of Rs 2.38 crore despite being a dominant world player in pulses trading. The alleged ruse offered for the discrepancies were âdepreciation/interest.â The total amount shown as depreciation and interest did not apparently tally with the accounts of the group examined by the IT officials. Besides, the losses that had accrued from trading did tally with the trading losses mentioned in the spreadsheet files. As per these documents, the trading loss was recalculated. After adjusting for depreciation and finance charges, it was found that the net profit before tax would have been Rs 4.54 crore for ETG and Rs 8.06 crore for ETC in 2014-15 alone. For 2012-13, the adjusted profit before tax was found to be Rs 19.54 crore against the Rs 7.72 crore that was shown in its audited accounts. The accounts of subsidiary companies ECL Commodities India Private Limited and Greenfield Impex Private Limited too indicated that the profits shown did not tally with what they had on their books.</P><P>Both ETC Agro Processing and ETG Agro traded through their group concerns abroad, with transactions not being incurred at armâs length. There was overwhelming evidence that export prices were suppressed to park profits abroad, the IT department has alleged. There are several spreadsheets wherein comparisons were made with prices offered by third party contracts. One excel workbook relating to yellow maize showed that the rates for unrelated parties varied from $400 per unit to $566 per unit in 2011 alone. However, exports to ETG companies were at $272 per unit. Exports were directly shipped from India to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, whereas bills were raised to its Singapore sister concern. There was no value addition by Singaporeâs Export Trading Commodities Pte Limited, which appeared to have been used merely for re-invoicing to undervalue the export prices. Because of the alleged heavy under-invoicing ETG/ETC kept on incurring losses on paper. Exports were allegedly under-invoiced to the extent of 40%-45%, and the corresponding profit was shipped out to associate concerns located abroad. Similarly, an analysis of import figures over years showed that imports of ETC Agro and ETG Agro from sister concerns were over-invoiced by 30%-57%. The group, thus, transferred its profits to its associate concerns which were located in tax havens.</P><P><B>ETG: Crisis due to increasing demand</B></P><P>The ETG Group has denied the IT departmentâs allegations. Doshi stated in an email to the EPW,</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""blurb""><P>The 2015 price increase was almost entirely driven by two years of back-to-back drought and increasing demand. There was acute shortage mainly in two or three pulses varieties from a total of 20 options available to consumers. But excessive sensationalisation impacted all prices beyond reason.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Doshi also wrote about âzero discrepancyâ in ETG stocks:</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""blurb""><P>During the IT surveys that (were) conducted pan-India, there was not even 1 MT (one metric tonne) difference between physical stock and ERP stock across all locations of ETG. Due to there being no discrepancies in the inventory physically found at all locations with the books of accounts, no seizure /payment of taxes (was) made at the time of the survey. All the discrepancies which were noted by the IT authorities at the time of survey and found by them in our computer systems were duly reconciled and submitted to the authorities in the post-survey submissions. The company continues to cooperate fully and provide all the information as required by the government agencies â¦ ETG stock was merely 2-28 days old and 100% within existent stock limits. ETG had 100% legitimately owned and stored stock and very less relative to our processing capacity, when the stock raids were conducted. ETG imports whole tur (raw pigeon peas) and the same is used for processing and not for trading. The dal made from this raw tur is sold daily across various states. It practically never has dal stock of more than ten days production in the factory which has been verified from the stock registers. The business model cannot afford to hold any more dal inventory that that.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Doshi also contended that ETG has never had membership of any commodity exchange. He stated: âThis has also been favourably noted by the concerned authorities. It is entirely into physical procurement, processing, value addition and distribution of goods.â He went on to add,</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""blurb""><P>ETG is perhaps the only company that publishes its prices daily on their website and emails dal prices to the government bodies daily. Prices are determined by the tens of thousands of companies and individuals speaking to each other daily, assessing supply and demand and the market finding its own level. Pulses market is extremely volatile due to the global vagaries of this highly rain dependent crop. Raw pulses prices fluctuate multiple times a day and for a wide range of varieties and qualities that are available.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>He claimed that ETG could not have controlled prices and commented on the character of the trade itself:</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""blurb""><P>India consumes about 25 million metric tonnes of pulses annually. There are tens of thousands of companies of all types and sizes that operate in pulses across India. It is not practically conceivable that in a mass commodity physical market, a company or few companies can truly influence the market prices. The end produce is not unique by any means and is easily substituted by consumers given the twenty varieties available. Any single company represents a mere drop in the ocean in the commodities market. At the wholesale level one would lose a customer for even Rs 1/kg extra pricing expectation as compared with the very broad marketâ¦.</P><P>While imports account for about 20% of Indiaâs pulses consumption they have attracted 80% of the attention given that, by definition they move in large consignments. Imports have been happening much the same way for the last 40 years. In all probability, 2015 was no different on that front. Moreover, the company did not have any purchase/sale of tur or its products with the other companies which were surveyed.</P><P>Millers logically prefer affordable prices. Affordable prices increase dal consumption, result in higher utilization of processing assets, need lower investment in inventory and greatly lower the downside risk. The prices fluctuate on a daily basis and at times one month can do more good or more harm than the rest of the 11 months for any participant in the agri-commodity sector. This is true not just for pulses.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Doshi also asserted that <mark>climate change</mark> is a reality and the reliability of agricultural output is under severe pressure.</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""blurb""><P>This key fact and its impact need to be accepted so that real solutions can be found. It is required to efficiently link farmers with consumers. Technology, professional talent and capital are essential to transform the sector. It is time for all of us to focus on solving that fundamental problem in a collaborative environment. We do believe that various government agencies have already studied volumes of data extensively to ascertain existence of any effective artificial influence on the price movements. The government is taking some very strategic steps for the transformation of this sector.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The IT departmentâs appraisal reports also included the full recorded and documented versions and opinions of the ETG Group, but had found them to be inadequate explanations/justifications.</P><P><B>Edelweiss: Through a dummy?</B></P><P>The Edelweiss Group is one of Indiaâs leading diversified financial services conglomerates with businesses ranging across capital markets, credit, asset management, life insurance, and commodities. The parent company of the group is Edelweiss Financial Services Limited, which was founded by Rashesh Shah who is also its chief executive officer (CEO) and chairman. Along with his wife, Vidya Shah, he holds a 27% stake in the group while co-founder Venkat Ramaswamy holds 10%. The others whose names repeatedly figured in the investigations are Himanshu Kaji (the groupâs chief operating officer) and Rujan Panjwani. The main group companies that were found to have played a role during the 2015 dal crisis were Edelweiss Commodities Services Limited, Edelweiss Financial Services Limited, and Edelweiss Trading and Holdings Limited.</P><P>On the basis of the documents and the digital files that were recovered, tax officials matched the books of the 45 companies in the Edelweiss Group with the records that had been filed with the IT department. They found that on tallying both realised and unrealised profits and on comparison with the returned income for assessment year 2016-17, in four cases, the income returned was significantly less than the profits shown up to November 2015. The cumulative returned income of Rs 215.41 crore was 25.18% of the total realised and unrealised profits of Rs 855.48 crore for four Edelweiss companies â Edelweiss Commodities Services Limited, Edelweiss Finance &amp; Investments Limited, Edelvalue Partners and Ecap Equities Limited. Tax officials have also wanted to re-examine the books of eight Edelweiss companies (EFSL Commodities Limited, Ecap Equities Limited, Edelvalue Partners, ECL Finance Limited, Ecap Equities Limited, Edelweiss Finance &amp; Investments Limited, Styrax Commodities Limited and Edelvalue Partners) which showed a cumulative loss of Rs 187.63 crore (up to November 2015). The balance sheets for the previous years showed that the returned income was significantly lower than accrued profits; the appraisal report called for the AO to examine the accounts and mark them as âsuppression of incomeâ in case explanations were considered âunsatisfactory.â</P><P>The Edelweiss group has been raising funds in Mauritius and Singapore through overseas entities. These funds eventually found their destination in India. Mails exchanged between Edelweiss officials (that were recovered by tax officials) showed how they allegedly discussed ways and means of avoiding scrutiny by the Foreign Tax and Tax Research (FTTR) division of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). The parent companies of these overseas units in India should be asked to reveal name and address of investors, the appraisal report said. Moreover, ECL Finance Limited received huge amounts as share capital for foreign permanent establishments (PEs) and foreign institutional investors (FIIs). The appraisal report asked the AO to make FTTR references to ascertain the identity of the true investors and find instances of round-tripping of funds. All these findings were considered âcircumstantialâ in nature.</P><P>The transactions related to the 2015 dal crisis led to Aster Commodities DMCC, which was formed in Dubai as wholly-owned subsidiary of ECIL Mauritius, which in turn was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Edelweiss Financial Services Limited, India. Aster was allegedly used to over-invoice import of pulses. The management and control of Aster vested in the India office of the Edelweiss group. Aster merely issued back-to-back bills to Edelweiss Commodities Services Limited after enhancing the rates. The goods were shipped directly from the port of origin to India whereas the bills were routed through Dubai. To this extent, Edelweiss Commodity Services Limited not only evaded taxes but also indulged in money laundering, the appraisal report concluded. Three of Asterâs directors â Durga Prasad Jhawar, Vinod Kumar Soni and Udit Sureka â were employees of different companies of the Edelweiss group in India. Even Jhawarâs housing loan had to be approved by the Edelweiss management team in Mumbai. Copies of emails exchanged among Edelweiss employees allegedly showed how they had worked hard to escape tax scrutiny in India.</P><P>Funds came to Aster mostly in the form of loans. For one loan amount from Axis Bank, Edelweiss Financial Services Limited was the guarantor. All decisions regarding fund transfers and business transactions were taken from and by core management team of Edelweiss at its Mumbai office. It was seen that Edelweiss divided its businesses in various segments, namely, bullion, commodity, derivatives, etc. Various companies, including overseas ones, also dealt in these business segments and were handled by the same team at Mumbai irrespective of the location of the entity. All this was ascertained from the emails that were recovered from Edelweiss employees.</P><P>Many of these mails drove home the point that all purchases from Aster, which was merely re-invoicing, were handled by the Edelweiss commodity team at Mumbai, mostly by operations manager Sitaram Chokhara. One mail showed that a shipment of yellow peas from Canada was being made to Tuticorin port. The seller was Glencore Grain BV and the buyer was Aster. This shipment was for September-October 2015, when the dal crisis was peaking. In this period, a flurry of emails was exchanged between Glencore and Edelweiss. Mails from Glencore suggested that a payment of $3.7 million was made by Aster DMCC to Glencore from a branch of ICICI Bank in Dubai. However, this transaction too was handled by Chokhara far away in Mumbai. These select mails showed Aster was merely a dummy company created solely for re-invoicing. All imports of pulses were handled by Edelweiss Commodity Services Limited, and Aster was interjected to ship out a part of profits at Dubai. There was also evidence of back-to-back billing by Aster in 2014-15 (during the dry monsoon which eventually led to the dal crisis).</P><P>The IT department claimed that a perusal of these bills showed a clear pattern: Aster consistently over-invoiced purchases of Edelweiss Commodity Services Limited by close to a third, that is, by around 30%. This was discovered by tallying numbers from Edelweiss Commodity Services Limited with the invoices of Aster. The percentage of over-invoicing varied from 7.59% to 88% and inflation was at a maximum in the case of purchases of pulses made by Aster from Singapore-based Agrocrop International.</P><P>This worked both ways, as was evident from the purchases that were made by Edelweiss Commodity Services Limited. Invoices showed that as against the rate of $640/tonne for green peas from Aster, the average rate from unrelated parties was $560/tonne. Thus, the Aster rates were higher by a good 18%. In the case of red lentils, the Aster rates were higher by 23%. Overall, the average rate of inflation of purchase of pulses from its own dummy company was estimated to be 10.8%. For these circumlocutory purchases at inflated rates, the IT departmentâs appraisal report called for the income of Edelweiss Commodity Services Limited to be increased by Rs 173.77 crore.</P><P><B>Keeping funds abroad</B></P><P>The Edelweiss group created many subsidiary companies in Mauritius, Singapore, Dubai, Cyprus, Hong Kong and Chad which did not pay any taxes in India on the ground that they did not have any PE in India. These were allegedly formed to achieve following objectives: ship out profits abroad in tax havens through a complex holding structure designed primarily to defeat tax laws; create and manage âfundsâ; access overseas commodity and currency markets to take advantage of price differentials; and for speculation in foreign markets. The appraisal report alleged,</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""blurb""><P>Analysis of seized/impounded data reveals that these companies are manned by employees of [the] Edelweiss group. All decisions with respect to their management and control is taken by core management team of [the] Edelweiss group at Mumbai. The funds by way of equity or loan are also provided by [the] Edelweiss group at Mumbai. Only a charade of documents have been created to show them as separate business entities at armâs length. However, the so created corporate veil must be lifted to unravel the truth and assess correct income in India.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The directors of the companies in these places were employees of the Edelweiss Group in Mumbai. Mails showed how the directors were chosen to bypass Indian tax laws. Different entities were managed by different employees but the integrated accounting gave the game away, or so the IT department would have us believe. The Edelweiss Group in Mumbai not only provided funds by way of equity, it also stood guarantor to loans from banks. According to one mail from May 2013, $100 million was invested in ECIL Mauritius by EFSL India. An earlier mail from April 2012 related to transferring funds from EC Global Mauritius to Singapore. The mail to Edelweiss COO Himanshu Kaji remarked that a more âhygienicâ way to deal with the situation was to repatriate the money from EC Global to India and âsufferâ a 15% tax, which eventually did not take place. All these led the appraisal reports to remark that the overseas entities â EC Global Mauritius, ECIL Mauritius, Aster Commodities DMCC Dubai, EISAA Mauritius, EISAF Singapore, EW Special Assets Advisors, EAAA PL Singapore, EW Special Assets Funds Singapore, Edelweiss Chad, Edelweiss Cyprus â should be taxed in India by the AO after due verification.</P><P>That was not all; Edelweiss took this forward by carrying out dollar trading in money markets. The appraisal report contextualised this in the following manner.</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""blurb""><P>Like the thriving non-deliverable forward (NDF) market in Singapore and London, where institutional investors, hedge funds and large business houses punt on the rupee, there exists another market, but more opaque, where bets happen on interest rate movements in India. This is the non-deliverable overnight indexed swap (NDOIS) market, where investors, who think interest rates will rise in India, strike deals to pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate while those who bet that interest rate will soften enter into contracts to pay a floating rate and receive a fixed rate. As the name (ND) suggests, no delivery of rupees happens in offshore markets, though underlying transactions are linked to rupee rates. The bets are settled in dollars. These large investors had a windfall after the central bankâs somewhat unexpected strike in the money market.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The emails seized contained evidence of huge profits made by the Edelweiss Group from money markets. The US dollar trading income of the group was equivalent to Rs 94.22 crore for 2012-13 and Rs 203.43 crore for 2013-14 which, according to IT officials, needed to be taxed in India since: (i) the trading was done by the groupâs dollar trading team in Mumbai; (ii) all decisions were taken only with the approval of core management team in India; (iii) the overseas concerns had PEs in India; and (iv) the funds were provided from India.</P><P>Edelweiss Trading &amp; Holdings Limited, which offers commodities broking and trading services, too came under the scanner of the IT officials. The company was earlier called Edelweiss Commodities Advisors Limited. Edelweiss Trading &amp; Holdings Limited was incorporated in 2004 and is based in Mumbai. Edelweiss Trading &amp; Holdings Limited operates as a subsidiary of Edelweiss Financial Services Limited. On examining the sales, closing stocks, realised and unrealised profits (primarily of pulses), it was found that the company had understated profits by Rs 13.06 crore in 2015 alone (till 31 October 2015). Moreover, it was seen from the inventory of closing stocks that for many items (read, pulses) the quantity was shown at a negative value.</P><P><B>Edelweissâ denial of cartelisation</B></P><P>Edelweiss has denied having played any role on what the IT department described as âcartelisationâ of the dal crisis. A spokesperson of Edelweiss Business Services Limited asserted over email to the <EM>EPW</EM>:</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""blurb""><P>Please note that Rashesh Shah, Venkat Ramaswamy and Himanshu Kaji are not on the Board; neither are they CEOs of this subsidiary and nor are they involved in the day to day management of the said subsidiary. We wish to state that the points raised are only allegations and that too, generic in nature, and in the absence of any specific questions it is difficult for us to specifically respond. We would also like to place on record that we are not in possession of any such report. We have always run all our businesses in a professional manner, strictly abiding by the laws of the land and all regulatory guidelines. In the case of the agricultural commodities business, Edelweiss has always ensured that the food and civil supplies department has been kept abreast of stock purchase and sales on a monthly basis, since inception. We deny any allegation of cartelisation on our part.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The IT department, however, was not satisfied with the responses.</P><P>Conspiracy theories abounded at the peak of the dal crisis, not all of which were entirely unfounded. Everyone knew pulses were being hoarded, but no one had a clue how this was affecting the entire trade and the market. Could hoarding alone lead to such a shortage that prices would skyrocket so much? Unless, of course, this was being done in a concerted and organised manner. And if bigger games were being played, how then did the so-called stage-managed scarcity of dal play itself out? The IT departmentâs appraisal report based on the raids carried out in the aftermath of the dal crisis did point towards the role that big corporations had played at the global level. It also got to the bottom of things by examining the books of a few key players who were manipulating stocks at the wholesale level in the country.</P><P><B>Jindals: Suppression of incomes?</B></P><P>The Dalip Jindal Group comprising Jindal Agro International, Jindal Green Crop International, SG Polyplast and Faquir Chand Dalip Kumar and the Pradip Jindal Group comprising Jindal Overseas Corporation allegedly suppressed their incomes through over-invoicing of purchases and under-invoicing of sales according to the IT departmentâs appraisal reports. They achieved this with the assistance of an entry operator Ashok Gupta in Delhi and Jindalâs selling agent-cum-unofficial partner Manoj Agrawal in Indore. The IT officials identified six âbogusâ concerns of Gupta and 17 benami firms of Agrawal. It was found that a part of the transactions of companies in the Dalip Jindal and Pradip Jindal Groups were with genuine entities and at market-determined prices. However, a part of these transactions were routed through the bogus concerns of Gupta and Agrawal. These were structured transactions at rates decided by the two Jindals, thereby reducing profits. The profit parked in these bogus and benami entities either came back to Dalip Jindal and Pradip Jindal and their concerns, or were utilised by Agrawal for buying unaccounted stock, playingÂ <I>dabba</I>Â or entering into speculative transactions.</P><P>Gupta said in a signed statement, âWe have carried out billings on the instruction of Shri Dalip Jindal at the rate and dates decided by him. Such bills are not corroborated by any other documentary evidence.â He then elaborated on the modus operandi:</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""blurb""><P>We work as commission agent and we wanted good business relations with big parties like Shri Dalip Jindal. He offered us to provide sale purchase bills of transactions which were not carried out and were just for passing entries. The sale purchase dates and sale purchase rates were instructed by Shri Dalip Jindal. We were offered negligible commission in lieu of this which we never received. We started this activity on the instruction of Shri Dalip Jindal around June 2015. We did this considering it as a normal business practice and in want of better clientele and reputation (<I>sic</I>). We were not aware of any further transactions.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Dalip Jindalâs so-called bogus firms Ridhi Sidhi Impex, SA Agro International and Gunn Enterprises had transactions with four of group companies. In all, fake bills worth Rs 1,160 crore were issued by Guptaâs firms to Jindal. The corroborative evidence came from Agrawal, who too submitted a signed statement to the tax authorities. Jindal could not furnish details of transactions apparently because of a fire at his office that he claimed had destroyed the documents. Printed bill books of Ridhi Sidhi were recovered from Agrawalâs possession.</P><P>To estimate the tax evaded through bogus purchase and sales bills, officials picked up random examples. In one case, back-to-back sales bills were raised by one Narmada Ginning and Pressing Factory. The truckâs licence number, the quantity and dates were identical. In 2014-15 and 2015-16, roughly 24% profits were evaded by Jindal Agro by routing it through Gunn and Narmada. Gupta said he issued purchase bills to concerns of Dalip Jindal at lower rates. These were then sold by Agrawal at higher rates. The money received by Guptaâs concerns was then transferred to the Dalip group which was shown by it as unsecured loan/sundry creditors. Towards the end of the year, this amount was squared off against bogus bills. The procedure was repeated ad infinitum and incomes remained unaccounted for. In 2014-15, the proportion of unaccounted income to actual turnover for Parth International (one of Guptaâs firms) was around 32.8%. On examining the books of Jindal Green Crop International, it was found that the allegedly concealed income as a percentage of turnover was 34%. In fact, the discrepancies that the income tax officials found mostly hovered around 33% or one-third of the overall turnover amount shown.</P><P>The suppression of income was done through various means. First, on re-examining the audited results, it was found that SG Polyplast, Jindal Agro and Jindal Green Crop had suppressed gross profits with unaccounted income being Rs 29.53 crore in 2014-15 alone. In 2015-16 (till the raids were conducted), Jindal Agro booked losses for trading in chana. However, from several files found from the computers of Agrawal it was found that the actual rates were much higher. Books were manipulated by over-invoicing purchase bills and under-invoicing sales bills which resulted in apparent losses for trading in chana. A sum of Rs 64.07 crore needed to be added to the income of Jindal Agro for 2015-16. Jindal was evidently aware that it had booked bogus losses for chana sales in the books of Jindal Agro. Jindal ignored them while working out its profit and loss, as was apparent from multiple excel sheets found on its computers. After accounting for the bogus losses and the actual profit made on trading in chana, another Rs 86.27 crore would have to be added to its income for 2014-15, the IT department claimed. Similarly, the suppression of income from SG Polyplast and Jindal Green Crop for that financial year came to about Rs 16 crore.</P><P>Glencore was found to be prima facie involved in providing accommodation entries to Pradeep Jindal through alleged manipulation of import prices. Mails showed that Jindal requested for remittance of $1 million as his credit balance with Glencore on 17 March 2015. Another mail revealed the mechanism that was devised to provide this amount to him in Singapore. Glencore manipulated contracted prices to create a credit balance of $1 million in favour of Jindal Oversees Corporation (JOC) as evident from a mail from an employee of Dongre, the IT officials alleged. This was in contrast with the books of JOC wherein Glencore appeared as a sundry creditor by $2 million. Thus, it was JOC which should have paid Glencore and not vice versa.</P><P><B>Lowest-rung manipulation</B></P><P>Investigation into Manoj Agrawalâs activities revealed how the scam played out at the lowest level. Agrawal alias Poddar was engaged in the trading of pulses, peas and grains. The commodity trading was managed through his proprietorship concern â Surya Foods in Indore. Surya Foods was also into physical trading of pulses, peas and grains. Agrawal had another proprietary concern called Manoj &amp; Company which acted as a broker and commission agent for trading in all types of foodgrains. Agrawal did commodity trading under the name of Arihant Future &amp; Commodities Limited, Indore. He controlled and managed several so-called benami concerns for issuing bogus bills of purchase and sale, adjusting rates of transactions (over-invoicing/under-invoicing), and managing the dabba (speculation) business, the IT officials claimed. Evidence in the form of pre-signed cheque books, blank signed forms for RTGS (or real time gross settlement for electronic transfer of funds in bank accounts), bill books and books of accounts (using Tally software) were found and impounded/seized. Agrawal accepted all these allegations in his handwritten submissions, or so the IT department has claimed.</P><P>Pre-search surveillance of Agrawalâs activities showed that he was running a dabba trade to hoard stocks and manipulate prices. This was corroborated through documentary evidence recovered during search and seizure operation on his firms. Agrawal maintained a list of clients with assigned client codes. Dalip Jindal of Jindal Agro International, Pradeep Jindal and Superior Agro (Vikas Gupta Group) were his main clients. The client codes were similar to the client code system used in recognised exchanges. Dabba trade is illegal as it is tantamount to running a parallel commodity exchange. The dots were joined by tallying the numbers recovered from Agrawal, the Jindals and the NCDEX: all these matched except that the trades were being conducted off official books of account. Agrawal traded on NCDEX on behalf of others including the Jindals and settled their accounts out of the books. He and his clients are liable for prosecution for indulging in illegal activities, the IT department concluded.</P><P>Agrawal also indulged in future trades. Before a shipment would reach India, brokers like Manoj &amp; Company would be asked to find buyers at a price fixed by the importer. The broker would sell consignments to other parties or brokers at a price that was higher than that fixed by the importer. There could be subsequent trades of purchase and sales. Agrawal would buy them back and sell again, and so on. One appraisal report of the IT department observed:</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""blurb""><P>Itâs like a commodity exchange where members enter into future trades. In these transactions, no physical exchange of consignment takes place, but Manoj &amp; Co and his clients may either earn a profit or loss. The profit or loss so obtained is not booked by Manoj &amp; Co and his clients. These are settled with physical delivery. Manoj &amp; Co only earns brokerage on the same.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Transactions went around in circles, enabling the players to make money at each stage. For instance, on 28 September 2015 (shortly before the government woke up to the spike in prices of urad and tur dal), Surya Foods (of Agrawal) sold to Fakirchand Vinodkumar &amp; Co 6,260 bags of imported tur dal at a price of Rs 9,500 per unit, which was immediately sold to Laxmi Cotton Industries at the rate of Rs 9,600 per unit. Laxmi Cotton again immediately sold this to Surya Foods at Rs 10,500 per unit. Thus, Surya Foods sold dal for Rs 3,00,05,280 and bought back the same for Rs 3,31,59,000 thereby incurring a âlossâ of Rs 31,53,720. Of course, both Fakirchand Vinodkumar &amp; Co and Laxmi Cotton Industries were associated concerns of Manoj Agrawal. Similarly, on 3 August 2015, Surya Foods sold 5,200 bags of imported tur dal for Rs 2,00,00,267 to Jindal Super Dal which sold the material to Narmada Ginning &amp; Pressing Factory for Rs 2,02,59,977. This was sold back to Surya Foods for Rs 2,07,79,397 thus creating a âlossâ of Rs 7,79,130 for Surya Foods. Narmada Ginning and Pressing Factory was allegedly a benami concern of Agrawal. All this was done with such impunity that the number of the truck used to carry the goods mentioned in each set of transactions was exactly the same!</P><P><B>NCDEX: Under a cloud?</B></P><P>The indirect role played by the NCDEX in accentuating the dal crisis is still being investigated. The speculation in trades in pulses and the alleged price manipulation were to a great extent facilitated by the NCDEX which played right into the hands of the cartel, the IT department believes. Coincidentally, it was in January 2015, that the Forward Markets Commission granted approval to the agricultural-commodity bourse NCDEX to launch forward contracts in seven additional commodities including some types of pulses. The approval was given to launch both transferable and non-transferable specific delivery forward contracts at a fixed price in urad, tur, yellow peas, yellow soyabean meal, pepper, RBD (refined, bleached and deodorised) palmolein and bajra. The NCDEX commanded an almost 100% share in trades in these agri-commodities. The deliveries of goods at the end of contracts were only 1%-2%. Moreover, a person could easily escape delivery be paying a meagre penalty of 2%-3% to the exchange. âSo, it is a 100% speculative exchange,â the appraisal report commented.</P><P>Documents with the IT department showed that Edelweiss âhoardedâ stocks of castor through its clients who bought on the NCDEX and sold entire stocks offline to Edelweiss to avoid scrutiny by the regulator. One such client was Pooja Mittal, who had never traded on the NCDEX platform, but was registered as a client under a broker named EC Commodities Limited, a group company of Edelweiss. Mittal purchased (delivery taken) from the NCDEX (as a client of EC Commodities Limited) and sold the entire delivery to Edelweiss Commodities. The IT department is currently working on a supplementary appraisal report on the NCDEX.</P><P><B>Conclusions: Piecing it all together</B></P><P>The IT officials could put everything together by tallying with one another the hard copies and digital documents that were recovered during the raids. Not everything could be recovered, but by cross-referencing whatever documents were impounded, what emerged was the existence of a cartel that operated at multiple levels and created the dal crisis of 2015. The story, however, did not end there. In June 2016 too, dal prices had surged with tur selling at Rs 170 a kg and urad at Rs 196 a kg. In September, a panel headed by the Chief Economic Advisor in the ministry of finance Arvind Subramanian called for procurement of pulses on a âwar footing.â It suggested better incentives for farmers in the form of higher MSP combined with effective procurement to increase domestic availability and prevent price spikes. Prices finally crashed in the winter of 2016 in the wake of a bumper crop in Maharashtra and Karnataka, and the acute cash crunch created by demonetisation. Four months later, tur dal prices hit an all-time low of Rs 3,950-4,050 per quintal after the deadline for central procurement at MSP through NAFED (National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India) and other agencies expired on 22 April 2017. Farmers were reported to be still holding over one-fourth of the stocks. In fact, the Centre was already in a quandary in April over what to do with the 20 lakh tonnes of pulse stocks.</P><P>Surprisingly, there were no high-profile raids in 2016, and even the governmentâsÂ <I>Economic Survey 2016â17</I>Â released in January gushed: âThe prices of pulses, in particular tur or urad, remained persistently high from mid-2015 to mid-2016 due to shortfall in domestic and global supply. Since July 2016, pulses prices except gram dal prices have been declining owing to near normal monsoon, increase in the rabi pulses sowing and buffer build up by the government,â the survey stated even as it added a word of caution: âVigilance is essential to prevent other agricultural products becoming in 2017-18 what pulses was in 2015-16 in terms of supply deficiencies and consequential higher inflation.â</P><P>The fact that a huge multi-level scam had taken place in 2015 resulting in a sudden spike in the prices of dal, in particular, tur and urad, seems to have been all but forgotten.</P><P>Note:Â The documents on which this report is based were provided to the editor of Economic and Political Weekly by a whistleblower.</P><P><EM>Subir GhoshÂ (<A href=""/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection"" class=""__cf_email__"" data-cfemail=""ef86818b868e818a8b869b809daf88828e8683c18c8082"">[emailÂ protected]</A>) is an independent author and researcher based in Bengaluru.</EM></P><P><EM>This article<A href=""http://www.epw.in/journal/2017/25-26/web-exclusives/when-nation-could-not-feel-pulse.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""> originally appeared</A> on</EM> EPW.</P></DIV><DIV class=""col s12 m10"" data-reactid=""164""><DIV class=""postComplete__commentHeader"" data-reactid=""165""><DIV class=""col s12 m12 postComplete__comments"" data-reactid=""166""><DIV class=""col s6 m6 left-align postComplete__commentHeader_nav"" data-reactid=""167""><SPAN data-reactid=""168"">Join The Discussion</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

By <A href=""https://reneweconomy.com.au/author/giles/"" title=""Posts by Giles Parkinson"" rel=""author"">Giles Parkinson</A> on 4 August 2017
</DIV><DIV class=""pf-content""><P>The coal lobby is showing increasing signs of desperation, dipping into their bags of increasingly tenuousÂ talking points in an attempt to find an argument to demonise renewables, battery storage, and promote their core commodity.</P><P>The latest comes from Australiaâs largest coal miner Glencore, the international mining giant, and its most senior executive in Australia, Peter Freyberg, who decided to join the conga-line of conservatives and vested interests seeking to diminish and mock the Tesla big battery in South Australia.</P><P>âThe much heralded proposed <A href=""http://www.afr.com/news/elon-musks-tesla-frances-neoen-win-landmark-sa-battery-tender-20170707-gx6jek"">renewable lithium battery storage in South Australia of 129 megawatt-hours</A>Â would power ourÂ aluminium smelter here in New South Wales for a grand total of 7.7 minutes,â Freyberg said, according <A href=""http://www.afr.com/business/mining/glencores-coal-chief-fires-up-on-energy-costs-20170801-gxnhrp#ixzz4ofA5Xdtm"">to the AFR,</A> which made it the lead story on its home page.</P><P>If youâve heard those arguments before, thatâs because they are similar to thoseÂ repeated by conservative commentators on radio and in the Murdoch press, and on the right wing of the Coalition government. Not to mention One Nation.</P><DIV class=""cq-article-content-paras section""><P>The Glencore comments came around the same time <A href=""http://anlecrd.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Managing-Flexibility-NEM-2017-Report.pdf"">as a study</A> financed by Australian National Low Emissions Coal Research and Development, which came up with this pearler â arguing that each megawatt of wind needed 23MWh of back-up in South Australia, and 48 hours in Queensland.</P><P>âIf storage were to be provided to back this up, then in SA it would need to hold at least 23MWh for each MW of wind. SA has about 1600MW of wind so to secure this against a wind drought would need 285 batteries of the size being built by Tesla at time of writing. The economics of this operation would be poor with some of the storage only being used once every 5 years.â</P><P>As one energy analyst noted, the idea of proposing to build 285 Tesla big batteries to cover a one-in-five-year event is âcompletely idioticâ.</P><P>First of all, it assumes that the power system will be nothing but wind and battery storage â solar, pumped hydro, biofuels, solar thermal? â and that the huge back-up built to support the inflexible coal generators would suddenly disappear.</P><P>But this has traditionally been the fossil fuel industryâs approach to back-up power â such as the 82MW Merredin diesel back-up generator in Western Australia which was paid for by subsidies and has never been switched on since it was built in 2012.</P><P>As the new head of the Australian Energy Market Operator, Audrey Zibelman argues, along with most other people not representing the coal lobby, there are smarter ways of dealing with supply shortages â demand management being just one.</P><P>The <A href=""http://anlecrd.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Managing-Flexibility-NEM-2017-Report.pdf"">ANLECÂ report </A>was designed with one idea in mind: to justify spending on coal-fired power stations and <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage.</P><P>âNew coal that is prepared for future <mark>CO2</mark> storage delivers immediate near term grid stability services while also securing the path to lowest cost <mark>carbon</mark> abatement in the long term,â it proclaims.</P><P>Likewise, Freyberg didnât try to hide his intentions. He wantsÂ the federal and state-based renewable energy targets to be scrapped; he backtracked on his previous cautious support for a clean energy target, and he argued Australia should slow its commitments to the Paris <mark>climate</mark> targets.</P><P>Given Australiaâs recent performance, he probably means Australia should reverse more quickly. Most of all though, he wanted wind and solar farms âtoÂ be linked with baseloadâ so they can be âturned on and off asÂ requiredâ. Presumably so as not to interfere with coal-fired generators, which canât be turned on and off.</P><P>This attachment to the concept of âbaseload,â rather than âreliabilityâ<A href=""https://reneweconomy.com.au/baseload-an-outdated-term-that-should-not-be-confused-with-reliability-34961/"">(we go into what that means here)</A> and flexibility, is troubling, not least because of the traction that it gains in media and government circles.</P><P>Treasurer Scott Morrison â he of the handful of coal in parliament â recently compared the Tesla battery storage to the Big Banana and the Big Prawn.</P><P>Freyberg said that âunless something happens quicklyâ to Australian electricity prices those businesses will shut. âWeâre going nowhere with emissions reductions, weâre just putting theÂ AustralianÂ economy at risk.â</P><P>But hereâs the inconvenientÂ truth about the issue: businesses that are being hit by high energy prices are turning to, and not away from, renewables as a solution, be they zinc refiners, steel works, mining operations or large-scale agriculture producers.</P><P>Koreaâs Sun Metals decided that building its own 116MW solar plant was the key to expanding its refinery near Townsville, the new owners of the Whyalla steel works say renewables will be the key to its future viability, the owner of what will be Australiaâs largest greenhouse for vegetable growing only decided to build it in Australia after realising that the combination of wind energy and battery storage offered the cheapest option.</P><P>Freyberg would do well to follow the example of both Sun Metals and Whyalla. He lamented the high energy costs faced by Glencoreâs operation in Mt Isa and Townsville, <A href=""https://reneweconomy.com.au/if-glencore-wants-cheap-energy-for-mt-isa-it-should-go-solar-25999/"">but as we reported before,</A> the situation in Mt Isa was largely self-inflicted.</P><P>It was Glencore that pushed the Queensland government to go against its own advice and go for a new gas fired generators rather than a renewables super-highway known as the Copperstring project.</P><P>Now it is the victim of high gas prices and a monopoly supplier.</P><P>Its Townsville operations could follow the same path as Sun Metals. No need to build its own solar plant, it could contract one of the more than dozen solar plants proposed for the area, <A href=""http://telstra solar"">as Telstra, </A>which consumes 1 per cent of Australiaâs electricity needs, has already done.</P><P>Thousands of smaller businesses are doing the same thing, and so are some big consumers on the electricity front: <A href=""https://reneweconomy.com.au/malcolm-turnbull-has-battery-storage-installed-in-point-piper-home-54504/"">Malcolm Turnbull (solar and battery storage in Sydney)</A> and <A href=""https://reneweconomy.com.au/bernardi-goes-solar-to-keep-the-lights-on-but-did-he-get-storage-80636/"">Corey Bernardi (12kW solar in Adelaide)</A>. You can be sure that Bernardi is doing this to save money, not cut emissions.</P><P>Another reality is that five of the worldâs six biggest companies by market capitalisation â Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon and â have all committed to going 100 per cent renewables.
Not so much because they want to save the planet, but because it is cheaper, and to show leadership. The owner of Fosterâs and VB, investment bank JP Morgan, retailer IKEA and numerous others have done the same thing, and more will follow.</P><P>The one bright aspect of Freybergâs comments to the press was the sight of fissures within the coal industry. He argued against any subsidies for the Adani coal mine in the Galilee Basin, because of the impacts on coal mines elsewhere highlighted by recent studies.</P><P>The fossil fuelâs main strategy against <mark>climate</mark> polices and renewable energy has been to divide and conquer, but their own unity is rapidly disintegrating.</P><P>The first signs of this came in the lead up to the Paris conference, when the oil and gas industry took aim at the coal sector. Now the coal sector, with increasingly tenuous economic prospects and shrinking markets, is fighting amongst itself.</P></DIV><P>Â Â </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

</P><P class="""">Unfortunately, the opposite is also true. But in these wired times we can express our disfavour by voting for the worldâs top corporate bad guy. Eight companies have been shortlisted for the annual Public Eye awards, given to the worst violators of human rights and the environment. </P><P class="""">The awards, which are sponsored by Greenpeace and the Berne Declaration, will be given out at the World Economic Forum at Davos in January to the (un)lucky winners. Thereâs also a jury award, selected by distinguished experts in business ethics, the environment and human rights, including Vandana Shiva.
Competition is tight. Nominees include such infamous corporations as Gap, Syngenta/Bayer/BASF, FIFA and Glencore Xstrata. </P><DIV class=""advert-r""><P>Advert</P></DIV><P class="""">The selection is so good, or rather, so terribly bad, I found it hard to pick just one. In the end, personal experience won out. I live not far from a mine owned by Glencore Xstrata (GX) in the mountains of Peru and have witnessed the long-running conflict.</P><DIV class=""blockquote quote--right right""><P class=""default"">In the Philippines, the companyâs proposed Tampakan mine will displace 5,000 members of the indigenous Bâlaan tribe</P></DIV><P class="""">Last May, three people were killed and about 100 wounded when police violently repressed protests at GXâs Tintaya mine. Oddly enough, protesters werenât trying to close the mine, they simply wanted improved environmental monitoring and funds for community development. </P><P class="""">Many of the demonstrators are pro-mining and earn a living providing services for the company. Like Carlos (not his real name) a young mechanic who was attacked by police as he and some friends were leaving the peaceful demonstration. </P><P class="""">âThe officers started beating us with their fists and kicking us with their boots, forcing us to the ground,â he said. âOne officer held a gun to my friendâs head and then fired into the ground.â</P><P class="""">Carlos was taken to the mineâs compound where, along with 22 other men and women, he was held for over 24 hours, enduring beatings and torture. </P><DIV class=""advert-l""><P>Advert</P></DIV><P class="""">This incident is just one in a slew of accusations against GX operations around the world. Human rights activists have united and formed the <A href=""http://observadoresglencorexstrata.com/home"">Shadow Network: Glencore Xstrata Watchdogs</A> to monitor the company and push for changes. Earlier this year I met with some of the networkâs members from Bolivia, Colombia, Argentina, the Philippines, Peru and Switzerland. </P><DIV class=""article-image""><P class=""article-caption"">Contamination from a mine owned by GX in Bolivia</P><P class=""article-credit"">Shadow Network: Glencore Xstrata Watchdogs</P></DIV><P class="""">Their stories are frighteningly similar: lack of environmental monitoring and controls, harassment and threats against leaders, police violence against peaceful demonstrations and an unwillingness to negotiate with legitimate community leaders. </P><P class="""">In Argentina GX faces three lawsuits, two for contaminating the environment and another for smuggling minerals without paying taxes. Colombian activists say the company faces nine disciplinary proceedings and more than 600 families have been forced off their land because of <mark>pollution</mark> from GXâs operations.</P><P class="""">The company also owns nearly a quarter of Lonmin, a platinum mine where 34 striking miners were shot dead last August in one of South Africaâs bloodiest police operations since apartheid. </P><P class="""">But it is Father Joy, a soft-spoken priest from the Philippines, who relates one of the most heart-wrenching tales. He says the companyâs proposed Tampakan mine will displace 5,000 members of the indigenous Bâlaan tribe from their ancestral lands, and that the community has not been adequately consulted about the project. </P><P class="""">His usually smiling face grows sombre as he tells me about a Bâlaan woman and her two children who were killed by the military last year. The murdered woman was the wife of a Bâlaan leader who opposes the Tampakan project; neighbours said the woman and her children were sleeping peacefully in their beds when they were killed. A few months later, the Bâlaan leaderâs younger brother was also killed by the military. During a Congressional hearing about the murders, members of the Philippine military said that GXâs subsidiary funds paramilitary groups in the zone.</P><P class="""">Joy and other network members say the recent merger of Glencore Xstrata has created a new global threat: a monolithic corporation that controls a large portion of the worldâs metals market and commodities. The newly married company has 90 offices in over 50 countries with its hand in everything from copper and zinc to offshore oil production assets, farms and agricultural facilities.</P><DIV class=""article-image""><P class=""article-caption"">A GX mine under construction in Colombia.
</P><P class=""article-credit"">Shadow Network: Glencore Xstrata Watchdogs</P></DIV><P class="""">When I asked GX to respond to the Public Eye nomination, a polite man from media relations sent me a 5-page document calling the allegations âunfounded and, at times, libellous.â</P><P class="""">Iâll sum up the document in one word: denial.</P><P class="""">Flat out, we didnât do it. </P><P class="""">The document says GX follows the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and has signed the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.
</P><P class="""">âVoluntaryâ is the key word: thereâs no enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance with the code and companies âself-regulateâ â meaning they decide what to report. </P><DIV class=""blockquote quote--right right""><P class=""default"">National police are paid to do the bidding of a private company. Dangerous? Ask the 23 people who were detained at the Tintaya mine last year</P></DIV><P class="""">This allows GX to boast about signing the code while quietly employing Peruvian police to provide security for their Tintaya mine. Human rights groups sent me a copy of the contract between Xstrata and Peruâs national police force, confirming that the company employs officers to guard the mine and has the âsupportâ of the provinceâs police commander.
</P><P class="""">Yes, the national police are paid to do the bidding of a private company. Dangerous? Ask the 23 people who were detained and tortured at the Tintaya mine by Peruvian police last year. Or the widows and children of the three men who were killed. </P><P class="""">In the face of such damning evidence maybe the fellows in charge at GX need to take a long, deep breath and realize itâs time to make some real, honest changes about the way they do business.</P><P class="""">Judging by the companyâs response to the Public Eye nomination, theyâre not quite there yet. This should make them an even stronger candidate for one of the top awards.
</P><P class="""">But thatâs just my opinion. Now itâs your turn to vote, according to your own conscience. </P><P class="""">No matter who you choose, this simple act will send a message to the worldâs economic leaders when they gather next year in Davos: weâre watching you, so shake those nasty ghosts out of your closet because sooner or later, the truth will come out. And next time, it might be you up on the podium, receiving the statue of corporate shame. </P><P class=""""><A href=""http://publiceye.ch/en"">Vote on the Public Eye Award.</A></P><P class="""">This video has been produced by Shadow Network for the Public Eye award:

In 2015 and 2016 the first two sessions of the open-ended intergovernmental working group on transnational corporations and other business enterprises with respect to human rights (OEIGWG) took place, and between October 23 and 27, 2017 the working group convened for the third time. More than 100 states and 200 representatives of civil society organizations participated in the third session, during which draft elements for a treaty presented by the Chair-Rapporteur of the OEIGWG were discussed. The draft elements include suggestions on state obligations, prevention, effective remedy, jurisdiction, international co-operation, and enforcement mechanisms. Despite persistent efforts by certain states to block the process, the march towards a binding treaty will continue. The Chair-Rapporteur will now hold informal consultations on the way forward and prospectively prepare a zero draft of the treaty up to the fourth session (expected in October 2018).

Through 20 case studies this report presents how corporate power has been used to repeatedly abuse and violate human and environmental rights. The cases show that corporate impunity for environmental destruction and human rights violations is a result of the current economic and legal system. State failure to protect human rights and the environment is caused by corporate capture of decision makers and state institutions, leading to the consequent refusal of politicians to implement binding frameworks and hold corporations to account. The clear failure of voluntary codes and corporate self-regulation to safeguard human rights or the environment has led to renewed public demand for binding rules.

The contributions to this special issue of the Global Policy Journal highlight critical issues in the study of Resourcing International Organizations (IOs), including resource diversiï¬cation, the complexity of related actor constellations, and organizational differentiation that goes hand in hand with resource diversiï¬cation. The ï¬ndings documented in the contributions reveal how IOs seek to obtain and allocate funds, and how resourcing-related concerns pervade their organizations. It also illustrates the value-added of an approach to the study of IOs that hones in on their administrations, their capacity for strategic action and their inter-connectedness, in short, an âadministrative governance perspectiveâ. The central message is that IO resourcing matters both practically and analytically.

In a new report, the European Environmental Bureau, Bread for the World and Forum Umwelt &amp; Entwicklung raise concerns over the âBetter Regulationâ project proposed by the Juncker Commission. According to the organizations, such a measure to curb regulation is unlikely to achieve its primary aim of improving Europeâs competitiveness. Efforts to reduce the burden of environmental regulations on business will simply subsidize Europeâs least competitive businesses by allowing them to dump part of their production costs on the environment, leaving taxpayers and citizens to pay for this through increased health care costs and efforts to clean up the environment. The âBetter Regulationâ agenda fails to take into consideration the benefits to society as a whole deriving from regulation. Addressing global challenges will require the EU to adopt new, effective and often legally binding policies. A blanket requirement to offset any regulatory burden arising from new policies by slashing regulatory burdens elsewhere irrespective of the benefits arising would seriously hamper these efforts. Both under TTIP and through its unilateral âBetter Regulationâ agenda, the EUâs governance system is changing significantly with a stronger role for well resourced regulated industries to write their own rules. <EM>(European Environmental Bureau/ Bread for the World/Forum Umwelt &amp; Entwicklung)</EM></P><DIV><P><STRONG>Report</STRONG></P><P>January 20, 2016</P><P>A new report by Global Justice Now demonstrates that the trend to involve business in addressing poverty and inequality is central to the priorities and funding of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

One key reason for the ineffectiveness of PPPs, writes Eurodad's MarÃ­a JosÃ© Romero, has been the scant attention paid to hidden debts run up by these partnerships. Indeed, public sector liabilities triggered by PPPs can be substantial and this has been the case for many PPPs. If this particular issue is not addressed properly, it has the potential to have long-term negative development impacts.

When combined with a grain, peas contribute complementary amino acids to form a complete protein meal. Peas can be prepared using a variety of methods, including boiling, frying, roasting, mashing, sprouting, fermenting, and milling into flours to make a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, roasted snacks and baked goods. Preparing whole peas involves overnight soaking, after which they will cook in approximately one hour. Split peas need not be soaked before cooking and will cook in 25 to 30 minutes. If split peas are soaked overnight, cooking time can be reduced to 13 to 15 minutes. Whether whole or split, cook by combining peas with double the amount of water.</P><H3>
