	Global <mark>climate change</mark> will aggravate problems such as poverty, social tensions, environmental degradation, ineffectual leadership and weak political institutions that threaten stability in a number of countries, according to a report the Defense Department sent to Congress yesterday.</P><P>
	The Senate Appropriations Committee requested the report in conjunction with the Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2015, asking that the undersecretary of defense for policy provide a report that identifies the most serious and likely <mark>climate</mark>-related security risks for each combatant command and the ways those commands integrate risk mitigation into their planning processes.</P><P><SPAN style=""font-size: 1em""><STRONG>Fragile States Vulnerable to Disruption</STRONG></SPAN></P><P>
	The report finds that <mark>climate change</mark> is a security risk, Pentagon officials said, because it degrades living conditions, human security and the ability of governments to meet the basic needs of their populations. Communities and states that already are fragile and have limited resources are significantly more vulnerable to disruption and far less likely to respond effectively and be resilient to new challenges, they added.</P><P>
	“The Department of Defense's primary responsibility is to protect national security interests around the world,” officials said in a news release announcing the report’s submission. “This involves considering all aspects of the global security environment and planning appropriately for potential contingencies and the possibility of unexpected developments both in the near and the longer terms.</P><P>
	“It is in this context,” they continued, “that the department must consider the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> -- such as sea level rise, shifting <mark>climate</mark> zones and more frequent and intense severe weather events -- and how these effects could impact national security.”</P><P><SPAN style=""font-size: 1em""><STRONG>Integrating <mark>Climate</mark>-Related Impacts Into Planning</STRONG></SPAN></P><P>
	To reduce the national security implications of <mark>climate change</mark>, combatant commands are integrating <mark>climate</mark>-related impacts into their planning cycles, officials said. The ability of the United States and other countries to cope with the risks and implications of <mark>climate change</mark> requires monitoring, analysis and integration of those risks into existing overall risk management measures, as appropriate for each combatant command, they added.</P><P>
	The report concludes the Defense Department already is observing the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> in shocks and stressors to vulnerable nations and communities, including in the United States, the Arctic, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and South America, officials said.

From this perspective of corporate social responsibility as a social contract we report the results of a survey of 1066 individuals. The aim of the survey was to assess participants’ belief in anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark>, free-market ideology, and beliefs around who is responsible for dealing with <mark>climate change</mark>. Results showed that both <mark>climate change</mark> views and free market ideology have a strong effect on beliefs that companies are responsible for dealing with <mark>climate change</mark> and on support for regulatory policy to that end. Furthermore, we found that free market ideology is a barrier in the support of corporate regulatory policy. The implications of these findings for research, policy, and practice are discussed.</P></DIV><DIV class=""sec""><STRONG class=""kwd-title"">Keywords: </STRONG><SPAN class=""kwd-text"">corporate social responsibility, environmental responsibility, <mark>climate change</mark>, pro-environmental behavior, behavior change, micro CSR</SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""__sec1"" class=""tsec sec""><H2 class=""head no_bottom_margin"" id=""__sec1title"">Introduction</H2><P id=""__p5"" class=""p p-first"">Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is based on the assumption that, at any given point in time, there is a social contract between an organization and society in which the organization has not only economic and legal responsibilities but also ethical and philanthropic responsibilities (<A href=""#B5"" rid=""B5"" class="" bibr popnode"">Carroll, 1991</A>, <A href=""#B6"" rid=""B6"" class="" bibr popnode"">1999</A>; <A href=""#B12"" rid=""B12"" class="" bibr popnode"">Donaldson and Dunfee, 1994</A>, <A href=""#B13"" rid=""B13"" class="" bibr popnode"">1999</A>, <A href=""#B14"" rid=""B14"" class="" bibr popnode"">2000</A>). Building on <A href=""#B5"" rid=""B5"" class="" bibr popnode"">Carroll’s (1991</A>, <A href=""#B6"" rid=""B6"" class="" bibr popnode"">1999</A>, <A href=""#B7"" rid=""B7"" class="" bibr popnode"">2000</A>, <A href=""#B8"" rid=""B8"" class="" bibr popnode"">2004</A>) work, <A href=""#B10"" rid=""B10"" class="" bibr popnode"">Dahlsrud (2008)</A> conducted a review of CSR definitions and suggested that the majority of definitions include at least two of the following dimensions (although they very rarely have all of them): societal concerns, interacting with stakeholders and social contract, an economic upside, environmental issues, and actions performed voluntarily. As such, we define CSR as a societal expectation, based on stakeholder perspectives (<A href=""#B8"" rid=""B8"" class="" bibr popnode"">Carroll, 2004</A>), that organizations should address economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary responsibilities. Within this research we are interested in two areas of CSR that <A href=""#B10"" rid=""B10"" class="" bibr popnode"">Dahlsrud (2008)</A> found to be less represented in current definitions – that of environmental issues and voluntary vs. forced action – and explore both what the social contract is surrounding these dimensions and how belief in anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> and free market ideology affect those societal views.</P><P id=""__p6"">Underlying our research is the need to examine the social contract on which CSR rests (<A href=""#B12"" rid=""B12"" class="" bibr popnode"">Donaldson and Dunfee, 1994</A>, <A href=""#B13"" rid=""B13"" class="" bibr popnode"">1999</A>, <A href=""#B14"" rid=""B14"" class="" bibr popnode"">2000</A>). If society’s expectations change, then CSR must as well or else it will face a perceived violation of the social contract. <A href=""#B30"" rid=""B30"" class="" bibr popnode"">Pinkston and Carroll (1996)</A> note that the demands that the public place on corporations do change; yet most of the research on CSR considers how the corporations themselves see their responsibilities or, at most, how their customers see their responsibilities (e.g., <A href=""#B28"" rid=""B28"" class="" bibr popnode"">Mohr et al., 2001</A>; <A href=""#B31"" rid=""B31"" class="" bibr popnode"">Russell et al., 2016</A>), and not how society more broadly views them. Alongside many others, we argue that because CSR is a social contract there is a need to understand not only what corporations and academics believe CSR to be, but also what society believes CSR to be and thus how it is operationalized in practice (<A href=""#B32"" rid=""B32"" class="" bibr popnode"">Sacconi, 2006</A>). We do so in the particular realm of environmental responsibility.</P><P id=""__p7""><A href=""#B10"" rid=""B10"" class="" bibr popnode"">Dahlsrud’s (2008)</A> analysis shows that the environmental dimension was the least common in definitions of CSR. This is surprising given the urgent need for organizations to address environmental issues and <mark>climate change</mark> (<A href=""#B29"" rid=""B29"" class="" bibr popnode"">Pinkse and Kolk, 2009</A>; <A href=""#B38"" rid=""B38"" class="" bibr popnode"">Winn et al., 2011</A>). Specifically, there is clear evidence that <mark>climate change</mark> and its effects are having deepening impacts across the globe and governments are contemplating the use of regulations to mitigate against further <mark>climate change</mark>. In this research we explore <mark>climate change</mark> as a CSR issue and question whether <mark>climate change</mark> should be included in the operationalization of CSR. As we are interested in the social contract, we specifically investigate whether society considers that dealing with <mark>climate change</mark> is something that a corporation should be concerned with.</P><P id=""__p8"" class=""p"">The second key focus of this research is on voluntary action. Although some have suggested that CSR must be voluntary for it to be considered CSR (<A href=""#B10"" rid=""B10"" class="" bibr popnode"">Dahlsrud, 2008</A>), it was not included in all definitions reviewed by <A href=""#B10"" rid=""B10"" class="" bibr popnode"">Dahlsrud (2008)</A> and therefore is debated rather than definitive. Instead, we follow <A href=""#B5"" rid=""B5"" class="" bibr popnode"">Carroll’s (1991)</A> framework that includes not only completely discretionary and ethical (in other words, voluntary but morally urged) CSR but also legally and economically motivated CSR, such as not polluting. Our research, therefore, allows us to explore whether <mark>climate change</mark> is seen, in the social contract, as being in the discretionary category of CSR actions, or whether the social contract around <mark>climate change</mark> action is such that it be mandated by government and thus fall in the legal category of Carroll’s framework.</P><DIV id=""__sec2"" class=""sec""><H3>Societal Expectations Regarding a Corporation’s Duty to Deal with <mark>Climate Change</mark></H3><P id=""__p9"" class=""p p-first"">The first part of our research is with the social contract itself; in other words, does the community view the social contract with corporations as encompassing <mark>climate change</mark> action and, if it is not discretionary (i.e., that they do see dealing with <mark>climate change</mark> as being the corporation’s duty), then to what extent do they believe it should be legally mandated? We argue that it is important to understand how the community views the social contract with corporations, particularly with regard to the specific concept of <mark>climate change</mark>, because only then will we have an understanding of expectations from both sides of the social contract.</P><P id=""__p10"" class=""p"">Marketing research has long looked at society’s expectations of corporations with regard to CSR, by examining consumer’s expectations. For example, <A href=""#B28"" rid=""B28"" class="" bibr popnode"">Mohr et al. (2001)</A> conducted in-depth interviews with 48 people and found that over half desired moderately high or high levels of CSR from companies. <A href=""#B25"" rid=""B25"" class="" bibr popnode"">Maignan (2001)</A> surveyed over 300 people from Germany, France, and USA; she found that consumers in France and Germany believed that companies were just as responsible for ethical and discretionary responsibilities as they were for economic outcomes. Moreover, although US consumers believed that companies had more responsibility for economic outcomes than philosophical or ethical endeavors, their scores on the latter (mean scores of 4.43 and 5.12 on a seven-point scale) indicate that they have moderately strong expectations for CSR. This previous research examined CSR more broadly than dealing with <mark>climate change</mark> and was focused on consumers rather than more general societal expectations, however, it does indicate that there are societal expectations for companies to be involved in CSR. Extrapolating from this, we propose that people in the community will also perceive that dealing with <mark>climate change</mark> is a corporation’s responsibility. In addition, rather than simply looking at mean scores, we also wanted to compare societal expectations for different loci of responsibility. To our knowledge, we are the first to compare loci of responsibility for dealing with <mark>climate change</mark> and therefore we do not have any evidence to suggest whether expectations for corporations are greater than that for other societal groups. Our first hypothesis, therefore, incorporates both our supposition that there will be high levels of expectations for corporations to deal with <mark>climate change</mark> and an exploratory examination of differences between societal groups:</P><UL class=""simple"" style=""list-style-type:none""><LI><DIV>Hypothesis 1: Community members will report strong expectations that it is a corporation’s duty to deal with <mark>climate change</mark>. We explore whether these expectations are greater than expectations that other societal groups (the international community, Federal, State and Local governments, individuals and families, and environmental groups) have a duty to deal with <mark>climate change</mark>.</DIV></LI></UL></DIV><DIV id=""__sec3"" class=""sec sec-last""><H3>Factors Affecting Expectations of Corporations to Deal with <mark>Climate Change</mark></H3><P id=""__p12"" class=""p p-first"">Although large-scale studies often measure beliefs in issues such as <mark>climate change</mark> at a societal level, there will of course be variation amongst the people within that society. Moreover, factors that are related to this variation may act as trigger points for change. Therefore, beyond a description of the current social contract, our research also explores the factors that may affect people’s perception of the social contract regarding <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P id=""__p13"">Much of the research around individual-level <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation, particularly in the workplace, has examined environmental values and beliefs that <mark>climate change</mark> is real; this research generally shows significant relationships between a person’s pro-environmental mitigation actions and his or her beliefs or values (<A href=""#B2"" rid=""B2"" class="" bibr popnode"">Bamberg and Moser, 2007</A>; <A href=""#B36"" rid=""B36"" class="" bibr popnode"">Unsworth et al., 2013</A>; <A href=""#B39"" rid=""B39"" class="" bibr popnode"">Young et al., 2013</A>). In particular, belief in anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> is a key predictor [following the <A href=""#B19"" rid=""B19"" class="" bibr popnode"">IPCC (2014)</A>], we define belief in anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> as a belief that <mark>climate change</mark> is occurring and that it is caused by human activities). Although this occurs at the individual level of action, we suggest that a similar effect could occur when considering organizational actions. In other words, when a person believes in anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> they are also likely to believe that companies should engage in mitigation actions. Our reasoning is this. First, organizations are fundamentally comprised of concentrated human activity (<A href=""#B3"" rid=""B3"" class="" bibr popnode"">Blackler, 1993</A>). Second, if a person believes that <mark>climate change</mark> is caused by human activity then, assuming they are not anthropomorphizing organizations (e.g., <A href=""#B4"" rid=""B4"" class="" bibr popnode"">Bruning and Galloway, 2003</A>), <mark>climate change</mark> should be seen as being caused by the concentrated human activity existing within organizations. Third, and finally, if they see <mark>climate change</mark> as being caused by organizations, then they are more likely to hold organizations as responsible for dealing with it (<A href=""#B16"" rid=""B16"" class="" bibr popnode"">Hamilton, 1978</A>).</P><P id=""__p14"">Moreover, research has shown that managers who see <mark>climate change</mark> as a threat to their organization are more likely to follow regulation rather than take on voluntary corporate environmental strategies (<A href=""#B33"" rid=""B33"" class="" bibr popnode"">Sharma, 2000</A>) therefore if a community member thinks that companies have a duty to deal with CSR, they may be unwilling to rely on managers engaging in it voluntarily (because if the manager sees it as a threat he or she will ignore the duty perceived by others) and instead are more likely to prefer that the company is held legally responsible. Thus, we propose that the more a person believes in anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark>, the more likely they are to view <mark>climate change</mark> as a non-discretionary part of CSR (i.e., ethical or legal) and the more it is viewed as non-discretionary, the more likely it is to be seen as something that should be legally mandated; we therefore hypothesize that:</P><UL class=""simple"" style=""list-style-type:none""><LI><DIV>Hypothesis 2: Belief in anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> will be positively related to support for corporate regulatory policy (i.e., legal responsibility), mediated by a positive relationship with beliefs that corporations have a duty to deal with <mark>climate change</mark> (i.e., non-discretionary responsibility).</DIV></LI></UL><P id=""__p16"">So far, we have followed the traditional thinking that belief in anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> (and its corollary for practical implication, changing people’s belief in anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark>) will be a panacea for changing the public expectations related to a corporation’s responsibility for dealing with <mark>climate change</mark>. But will this be enough? We propose that as well as beliefs about <mark>climate change</mark>, when we consider the social contract with corporations we also need to consider beliefs about the perceived broader role of organizations in society; in other words, we suggest that free market ideology is necessary to consider.</P><P id=""__p17"">An ideology is a worldview that is comprised of “a system of values, norms, and political preferences” (<A href=""#B9"" rid=""B9"" class="" bibr popnode"">Carvalho, 2007</A>, p. 225) and a free market ideology is defined as the “tendency to view market-based processes and outcomes not simply as efficient, but as inherently fair, legitimate, and just” (<A href=""#B20"" rid=""B20"" class="" bibr popnode"">Jost et al., 2003</A>, p. 55). It is ‘the invisible hand’ (<A href=""#B34"" rid=""B34"" class="" bibr popnode"">Smith, 1776</A>) that will take care of everything through market demand and competition.</P><P id=""__p18"">Previous research has shown a main effect for free market ideology on belief in anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark>; namely that it is significantly related to belief in anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> mediated by environmental apathy (<A href=""#B18"" rid=""B18"" class="" bibr popnode"">Heath and Gifford, 2006</A>), with stronger support for the free market corresponding to greater environmental apathy and in turn lower belief in anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark>. However, we propose that free market ideology will have an additional effect to its relationship with anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark>, and that is its effect on whether a person believes that dealing with <mark>climate change</mark> is a legal, ethical or discretionary responsibility of the organization. That is, we propose that free market ideology will affect a community member’s perception that a corporation should be held legally responsible for dealing with <mark>climate change</mark>. Logically, if an individual believes that the free market will solve the problem, that person should also hold the belief that the company is not directly responsible as the market will decide if the company needs to do anything; if consumers don’t want environmentally friendly products and services then why should the company have to provide them? Indeed, as noted earlier, <A href=""#B25"" rid=""B25"" class="" bibr popnode"">Maignan (2001)</A> found differences in consumer expectations of CSR across countries which she attributed to differing ideologies.</P><P id=""__p19"">Empirical evidence for this can be seen in studies examining political orientation. Belief in the free market is a key differentiator of political orientations; those on the right (Conservatives, Republicans, Liberals) have strong beliefs in a key role for the free market and thus a weak role for government, while those on the left (Labor, Democrats, Greens) have less strong beliefs in the ability of the free market to overcome social and environmental problems (<A href=""#B18"" rid=""B18"" class="" bibr popnode"">Heath and Gifford, 2006</A>). Research has shown that those on the right tend to not only believe less in anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> (<A href=""#B15"" rid=""B15"" class="" bibr popnode"">Dunlap and McCright, 2008</A>; <A href=""#B26"" rid=""B26"" class="" bibr popnode"">McCright, 2011</A>; <A href=""#B27"" rid=""B27"" class="" bibr popnode"">McCright and Dunlap, 2011</A>) but, importantly, they are also less likely to support policies to mitigate <mark>climate change</mark> (<A href=""#B37"" rid=""B37"" class="" bibr popnode"">Unsworth and Fielding, 2014</A>).</P><P id=""__p20"" class=""p"">In addition, we argue that these two factors, belief in anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> and free market ideology, will interact. As discussed earlier, those who believe in anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> should, rationally, believe that all humans are responsible and thus that corporates (as human collectives) are also responsible for dealing with <mark>climate change</mark>; there should therefore be a positive relationship between anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> and belief in corporate responsibility to deal with <mark>climate change</mark>. However, if one has a strong free market ideology this relationship will be stronger than if one has a weak free market ideology because of the synergistic effects of free market ideology and anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark>. In the first instance, the combination of a strong free market ideology and low belief in anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> will result in very low perceptions that a company has a duty to deal with <mark>climate change</mark> because the two beliefs reinforce each other; but having a strong free market ideology will not greatly affect the person’s perception of a corporation’s duty to deal with <mark>climate change</mark> if they have a high belief in anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark>. This is because there is a strong logical relationship between believing that humans are responsible (high belief in anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark>) and believing that companies, alongside others, are responsible for dealing with it. In the second instance, when free market ideology is weak, then a weak belief in anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> won’t be as detrimental to beliefs in corporate responsibility to deal with <mark>climate change</mark> and the resulting perception of corporate responsibility will not be as low; hence the relationship between anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> and a belief in corporate responsibility to deal with <mark>climate change</mark> will not be as strong. Overall, this means that the relationship between belief in anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> and perceptions that corporations have a duty to deal with <mark>climate change</mark> will be stronger when free market ideology is strong compared to when it is weak.

Home PCs or personal iPhones and iPads can also be connected to an environment equivalent to the office PC, allowing flexibility in working time and location, such as teleworking from home, when on the move or from outside of the office.</P><P>Furthermore, with computer processing carried out on network servers rather than individual computers, computer power consumption can be reduced. By centralizing these servers at a large-scale data center, operational efficiency can be improved and overall power consumption will be reduced.</P><P>According to estimates by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, energy consumption from the use of office automation equipment and lighting can be reduced by 43% with the introduction of telework. Even when energy consumption at the home office is factored in, it is possible to reduce energy consumption by 14%. Through the promotion of teleworking, it is possible to reduce the amount of energy consumption throughout society. It is also an important initiative from an energy conservation standpoint.</P><P>Moreover, through the use of iPhones and iPads, documents stored on servers can be accessed as necessary.

The international legal framework established in 1992 to prevent “dangerous anthropogenic interference” with the <mark>climate</mark> system has focused attention on the role of nation-states, and has led to commitments by many nation-states (particularly the Annex I or highly developed nations) to cut their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, current <mark>climate change</mark> is primarily driven by historic emissions (Allen et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR2"">2009b</A></SPAN>; Matthews et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR37"">2009</A></SPAN>; Wei et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR60"">2012</A></SPAN>; IPCC <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR26"">2013</A></SPAN>), and the parties responsible for the dominant sources of historic emissions are not necessarily the same as those responsible for the dominant share of current emissions. This paper provides an original quantitative analysis of historic emissions by tracing sources of industrial CO<SUB>2</SUB> and methane to the 90 largest corporate investor-owned and state-owned producers of fossil fuels and cement from as early as 1854 to 2010. The purpose of this analysis is to understand those historic emissions as a factual matter, to invite consideration of their possible relevance to public policy, and to lay the possible groundwork for apportioning responsibility for <mark>climate change</mark> to the entities that provided the hydro<mark>carbon</mark> products to the global economy.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""Sec2"" tabindex=""-1"" class=""Section1 RenderAsSection1""><H2 class=""Heading""><SPAN class=""HeadingNumber"">2 </SPAN>International policy and historic emissions</H2><DIV class=""content""><P class=""Para"">Cumulative historic emissions have caused persistently higher atmospheric concentration of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and other GHG emissions (Matthews et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR37"">2009</A></SPAN>; Zickfeld et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR67"">2010</A></SPAN>). While atmospheric concentrations of CO<SUB>2</SUB> can be lowered in several ways, it is generally agreed that to avoid further dangerous anthropogenic interference in the <mark>climate</mark> system, net future emissions must be reduced from business-as-usual projections. Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (UNFCCC <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR54"">1992</A></SPAN>, “Framework Convention”) agreed that developed nations “on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities … should take the lead in combating <mark>climate change</mark> and the adverse effects thereof.” By “differentiated” it was recognized that Annex I nations had produced most of the GHG emissions, and therefore were responsible for taking the first steps in reducing emissions. Numerous proposals on equitable distribution of burdens and remedies for <mark>climate change</mark> have been made. These include equal per capita allocation over time (Baer et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR3"">2000</A></SPAN>; Bode <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR5"">2004</A></SPAN>), contraction and convergence toward a common per capita emission rate at a predetermined year (Global Commons Institute <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR16"">2008</A></SPAN>), common but differentiated convergence with favorable allowances for non-Annex I countries (Höhne et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR21"">2006</A></SPAN>), multi-criteria regimes that account for historic responsibility, capability to contribute, and needs, such as poverty alleviation (Ringius et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR44"">2002</A></SPAN>), and remaining CO<SUB>2</SUB> and methane “debt” from historic emissions (Smith et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR48"">2013</A></SPAN>). Ignoring historic emissions that disadvantage poorer nations violate the principle embodied in the 1972 UN Conference on the Human Environment that nation-states’ “sovereign right to exploit their own resources” is subject to not causing “damage to the environment of other states.” (Neumayer <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR39"">2000</A></SPAN>).</P><P class=""Para"">One of the proposals that account for historic emissions is the Brazilian Proposal, analyzed by the UNFCCC Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technical Advice (SBSTA) in the run-up to Kyoto, which suggested that the burden of addressing <mark>climate change</mark> should be apportioned on the basis of the temperature response from national historic CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions (den Elzen et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR10"">2005</A></SPAN>; Rive et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR45"">2006</A></SPAN>; Baumert and Kete <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR4"">2002</A></SPAN>). Such equity-based proposals argue, in part, that wealth is closely tied to historic energy use and therefore to historic emissions and attributed radiative forcing, and it is appropriate to apportion greater responsibility for emissions reductions to the nations that became wealthy in large part by consuming, and in many cases producing, the <mark>carbon</mark> fuels for the world market (Gardiner <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR13"">2004</A></SPAN>; Jamieson <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR30"">2009</A></SPAN>).</P><P class=""Para"">Annex I countries rejected this argument on the grounds that they could not be held responsible for emissions made prior to 1990, when the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC) first warned that greenhouse gas emissions were contributing to global warming. In essence, they argued that they could not be held responsible for a problem they did not yet know existed. This argument ignores the many scientific warnings published in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s (President’s Science Advisory Committee <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR43"">1965</A></SPAN>; Matthews et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR36"">1971</A></SPAN>; Broecker <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR6"">1975</A></SPAN>; World Meteorological Organization <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR66"">1976</A></SPAN>; National Research Council <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR38"">1979</A></SPAN>; U.S. EPA <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR50"">1983</A></SPAN>; see discussion in Weart <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR59"">2003</A></SPAN>; Fleming <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR12"">2005</A></SPAN>; Oreskes and Conway <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR41"">2010</A></SPAN>). In addition, many countries, including Brazil and the United States, have laws embracing the legal principle of “objective responsibility” by which a polluter cannot escape responsibility by claiming ignorance of environmental damages (La Rovere et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR31"">2002</A></SPAN>; Gardiner <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR14"">2011</A></SPAN>).</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""Sec3"" tabindex=""-1"" class=""Section1 RenderAsSection1""><H2 class=""Heading""><SPAN class=""HeadingNumber"">3 </SPAN>A new approach: tracing emissions to producers</H2><DIV class=""content""><P class=""Para"">The question of wealth generated through the production and use of fossil fuels suggests an alternative to the nation-state approach: to analyze emissions in terms of the fossil fuels produced by incorporated entities—such as investor-owned or state-owned companies—rather than states as consumers and emitters. This perspective calls attention to the fact that substantial emissions have come from fossil fuels sourced from non-Annex I countries such as China, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Iran, Brazil, and Mexico, and from nations that are not large scale emitters, such as Nigeria, Venezuela, Kuwait, Angola, Malaysia, and Libya. The Framework Convention apportions responsibility to the wealthy Annex I nations that have benefited most from using fossil fuels. However, considerable wealth has also accumulated to nations and companies that produce the fuels sold on the international market. For this reason, the present analysis focuses on the world’s largest investor-owned and state-owned <mark>carbon</mark> producers, whether situated in Annex I or non-Annex I nations, and invites consideration of the suggestion that some degree of responsibility for both cause and remedy for <mark>climate change</mark> rests with those entities that have extracted, refined, and marketed the preponderance of the historic <mark>carbon</mark> fuels.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""Sec4"" tabindex=""-1"" class=""Section1 RenderAsSection1 SectionTypeMaterialsAndMethods""><H2 class=""Heading""><SPAN class=""HeadingNumber"">4 </SPAN>Analysis and methods</H2><DIV class=""content""><P class=""Para"">For tractability, a threshold of ≥8 million tonnes <mark>carbon</mark> per year (MtC/y) for fossil fuel production was established. This resulted in the identification of 90 entities: 50 of which are investor-owned companies, 31 are state-owned enterprises, and 9 are current or former centrally planned states. Of these 90 entities 56 are crude oil and natural gas producers, 37 are coal extractors (including subsidiaries of oil &amp; gas companies), and 7 are cement producers. Headquartered in 43 countries, these entities extract resources from every oil, natural gas, and coal province in the world, and process the fuels into marketable products that are sold to consumers in every nation on Earth.</P><P class=""Para"">Company production records were retrieved from publicly available annual reports from university and public library collections in Europe, North America, Africa, and Asia, from company websites, company reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, company histories, and other sources. The <mark>carbon</mark> content of each entity’s annual production of coal, oil and natural gas liquids, and natural gas was calculated using IPCC, United Nations, International Energy Agency (IEA), and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <mark>carbon</mark> factors to quantify the annual emissions traceable to each entity. Historically complete records were sought from the earliest records available (the earliest is from 1854) through 2010. Where mergers or acquisitions occurred, <mark>carbon</mark> production and emissions prior to the date of acquisition are attributed to the extant company.</P><P class=""Para"">Since the objective of the analysis is to estimate <mark>carbon</mark> entering the atmosphere, two important calculations are made. The first is for non-combustion uses of hydro<mark>carbon</mark> products.</P><P class=""Para"">For crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs), non-energy uses include petrochemicals, lubricants, road oil, waxes, solvents, and other industrial uses; for natural gas they include fertilizer production and pharmaceuticals; and for coal include pigments, <mark>carbon</mark> fibers, and steel making. These non-combustion uses effectively store <mark>carbon</mark>, and thus must be subtracted from the emission calculations. The net storage rates were derived from 1980 to 2010 data on non-energy uses in the United States following the IPCC inventory and <mark>carbon</mark> storage protocols (Environmental Protection Agency <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR52"">2012a</A></SPAN>, <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR53"">b</A></SPAN>; IPCC <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR24"">2006</A></SPAN>). Short-term combustion of petrochemical products such as plastics in waste-to-energy plants, synthetic tires burned in cement kilns, recycled lubricating oils used as fuel (or oxidized in normal use), wax burning, petroleum coke used in refineries, special naphthas volatilized in paints, and other uses are credited back to the oxidation column in determining the final storage and emission rates for each fuel type. The final net storage rates are 8.02 % for liquids, 1.86 % for natural gas, and 0.016 % for coal.</P><P class=""Para"">The analysis accounts for the <mark>carbon</mark> content of each fuel, and therefore the CO<SUB>2</SUB> released on combustion to the atmosphere. This is particularly important for coal, since producers report physical quantities rather than heating values (i.e., tons, barrels, or cubic feet rather than energy content). The <mark>carbon</mark> content factors for each fuel follow international guidelines. The <mark>carbon</mark> content varies most for coal—from ~33 % <mark>carbon</mark> for lignites to ~72 % <mark>carbon</mark> for anthracites—and the rank of produced coal is noted when reported. In many cases producers provided scant guidance on heating values or rank of coal mined, instead using generic labels such as “thermal coal” or “metallurgical coal,” in which cases the average IPCC values for these fuels have been applied. (See <SPAN class=""InternalRef""><A href=""#MOESM1"">Supplementary Materials</A></SPAN>).</P><P class=""Para"">Additional emission sources attributable to oil, gas, and coal operations include CO<SUB>2</SUB> vented from processing of raw (sour) natural gas, CO<SUB>2</SUB> from gas flaring (typical at oil production sites where gas is stranded), and fugitive or vented methane from oil and gas operations and coal mining. These emission rates were derived from IPCC Tier 1 factors and corroborated with EPA data on CO<SUB>2</SUB> and CH<SUB>4</SUB> leakage, flaring, and venting rates (IPCC <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR24"">2006</A></SPAN>; EPA <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR52"">2012a</A></SPAN>, <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR53"">b</A></SPAN>), flaring data from the World Bank (World Bank <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR62"">2012a</A></SPAN>), and coal mine methane venting rates using data from U.S. and international sources (EPA <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR51"">2011</A></SPAN>, <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR53"">2012b</A></SPAN>; Stern and Kaufmann <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR49"">1998</A></SPAN>; European Commission <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR11"">2011</A></SPAN>). Operational emission rates vary across the global oil, gas, and coal industries by country, company, field location, offshore vs. onshore, surface vs. underground coal mining, and decade of production. In all cases, the factors applied to each producing entity are within the ranges proscribed by credible international sources.</P><P class=""Para"">The emission factors, methodology, and results are compared to the <mark>Carbon</mark> Dioxide Information Analysis Center’s (CDIAC) database of global CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from 1751 to the present (Marland and Rotty <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR34"">1984</A></SPAN>; Marland et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR35"">2011</A></SPAN>). Methane emission rates are compared to the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre’s <SPAN class=""EmphasisTypeSmallCaps "">edgar</SPAN> database of global CH<SUB>4</SUB> emissions by source from 1970 to 2008 (extrapolated to 2010; Stern &amp; Kaufmann methane data for 1860–1969). (See <SPAN class=""InternalRef""><A href=""#MOESM1"">Supplementary Materials</A></SPAN>, and Heede <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR19"">2013</A></SPAN>). A global warming potential for methane of 21 × CO<SUB>2</SUB> (100-year time horizon) is used (IPCC <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR23"">1996</A></SPAN>).</P><P class=""Para"">Seven cement manufacturers—six investor-owned companies in Japan, Switzerland, France, Germany, Italy, and Mexico, plus China—contributed process emissions from the calcining of limestone (CaCO<SUB>3</SUB> → CaO + CO<SUB>2</SUB>). Emissions of CO<SUB>2</SUB> from energy inputs to kilns and power plants are excluded. The data is for 1990 to 2010, except China (from 1928). Calcining emissions are from industry data submitted to the World Business Council for <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development’s Cement Sustainability Initiative (WBCSD <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR64"">2011</A></SPAN>).</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""Sec5"" tabindex=""-1"" class=""Section1 RenderAsSection1""><H2 class=""Heading""><SPAN class=""HeadingNumber"">5 </SPAN>Conservatisms, caveats, and uncertainties</H2><DIV class=""content""><P class=""Para"">Production data and thus attributed emissions are generally conservative. Early production records are not always available, emission factors are typically at or below international values, non-energy uses were far lower in the early decades than the applied sequestration factor of 8 % for petroleum products (thus emissions would have been commensurately higher), natural gas production was often not reported by producers prior to 1930 (gas was a low-value fuel in the early 20th century, and often flared or vented to the atmosphere); accidental spills, “upset conditions,” and emissions from acts of sabotage or war have been excluded from this analysis. CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions by the cement industry do not cover production prior to 1990 (except for China). Consequently, this study underreports fossil fuel and cement production compared to the actual history of production by nearly all of the <mark>carbon</mark> major entities. Unpublished company records (if released) may fill in these reporting gaps in the future.</P><P class=""Para"">Potential sources of double-counting of oil and gas production have been minimized. Many oil majors only reported gross rather than net or equity production in the 1950s to mid-1970s; this analysis estimates net production by applying a net-to-gross ratio to those companies that reported only gross production for selected years, based on each entity’s reporting of both net and gross production in later years. Many state-owned oil companies report production in part attributable to their international joint venture or production-sharing partners, or is otherwise ambiguous or incomplete and often report total oil and gas production within the nation’s territory or territorial waters. The details of production-sharing agreements, concessions, and joint ventures are not publicly available, but each state-owned entity has been analyzed in terms of dates of nationalization, equity buy-outs or asset seizures, and fractional shares of national production to the extent this is publicly available (Victor et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR58"">2012</A></SPAN>; Marcel <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR33"">2006</A></SPAN>; World Bank <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR61"">2008</A></SPAN>). Complete reporting by both investor-owned and state-owned companies on equity or working interest production will remove any remaining inaccuracies. (See <SPAN class=""InternalRef""><A href=""#MOESM1"">Supplementary Materials</A></SPAN> and Heede <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR19"">2013</A></SPAN>).</P><P class=""Para"">Attributed methane emissions are conservative relative to global coal industry methane emissions (38 % of coal-related methane versus 51 % of global coal production). IPCC default methane emission rates (which are 16 times higher for underground mining than for opencast) are applied to all <mark>carbon</mark> major coal entities; this factor is scaled to the proportion of production by mining method (60 % underground, and 40 % opencast) (IPCC <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR24"">2006</A></SPAN>; World Coal Association <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR65"">2005</A></SPAN>). However, coal operators often do not specify opencast or underground production, and <mark>carbon</mark> major entities may be attributed methane emissions that are substantially lower than their actual emissions, or vice-versa. In addition, operators differ on direct venting versus flaring or utilizing the methane, and company reporting on methane generation, venting, and disposition is generally poor.</P><P class=""Para"">Factors for non-energy uses and direct emission of CO<SUB>2</SUB> from flaring and venting and fugitive methane are based on international standards and data (IPCC <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR24"">2006</A></SPAN>; U.S. EPA <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR53"">2012b</A></SPAN>; European Commission <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR11"">2011</A></SPAN>; United Nations <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR55"">2012</A></SPAN>; see Heede <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR19"">2013</A></SPAN>). These are applied to each entity, for each fuel, and for each year, but the operations of individual companies often vary from international norms. Attributed methane, vented CO<SUB>2</SUB>, and flaring emissions are conservative relative to international data on emission rates (IPCC <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR24"">2006</A></SPAN>; Marland et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR35"">2011</A></SPAN>; European Commission <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR11"">2011</A></SPAN>).</P><P class=""Para"">This study includes energy consumption and emissions from the oil and gas industry’s use of its own fuels at a rate of 5.9 % of natural gas production, less than the 9.5 to 10 % of combined oil and natural gas production estimated for the oil and gas supply chain by the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR29"">2011</A></SPAN>).</P><P class=""Para"">Uncertainty ranges are difficult to estimate given the variety of producing entities, reporting quality and completeness, and the additional emission sources applied to entities with differing operating characteristics. Overall, however, the total emissions attributed to the fossil fuel producers in this study are in close agreement with CDIAC estimates in proportion to fuel production data for 1980–2010 (−2.3 % for crude oil &amp; NGLs, +1.0 % for natural gas, and +3.3 % for coal). The uncertainties are mainly a result of incomplete or unclear reporting by the fossil fuel and cement producers.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""Sec6"" tabindex=""-1"" class=""Section1 RenderAsSection1 SectionTypeResults""><H2 class=""Heading""><SPAN class=""HeadingNumber"">6 </SPAN>Results: “<mark>carbon</mark> majors”</H2><DIV class=""content""><DIV class=""Para"">A total of 914 billion tonnes of CO<SUB>2</SUB>-equivalent (GtCO<SUB>2</SUB>e) has been traced to 90 international entities based on analysis of historic production records dating from 1854 to 2010.

This regime has so far failed to reduce global GHG emissions (Olivier et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR40"">2012</A></SPAN>; Peters et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR42"">2012</A></SPAN>; IEA <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR27"">2012a</A></SPAN>; Victor <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR56"">2009</A></SPAN>; Höhne et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR22"">2011</A></SPAN>), and some observers have concluded that the process is at an impasse (Victor <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR57"">2011</A></SPAN>; Schiermeier <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR47"">2012</A></SPAN>; Rogelj et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR46"">2010</A></SPAN>).</P><P class=""Para"">While not disputing the logic of the UNFCCC, the analysis presented here suggests a somewhat different, and perhaps useful, way to consider responsibility for <mark>climate change</mark>. The analysis highlights the fact that major producers of fossil fuels are not all located in Annex I nations: Saudi Arabia, Iran, China, India, Venezuela, Mexico, Kuwait, Abu Dhabi, and Algeria appear on the list of top twenty producers (Table <SPAN class=""InternalRef""><A href=""#Tab3"">3</A></SPAN>). Of the 85 extant entities, 54 are headquartered in Annex I countries, and 31 in non-Annex I nations. Considerable benefits have accrued to these <mark>carbon</mark> majors, and to their state-sponsors and investors. Given this, it seems reasonable to argue that they have an ethical obligation to help address <mark>climate</mark> destabilization (Gardiner et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR15"">2010</A></SPAN>; Gardiner <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR14"">2011</A></SPAN>). Moreover, many of these entities—both state- and investor-owned—possess the financial resources and technical capabilities to develop and contribute to <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation and adaptation.</P><P class=""Para"">The full menu or analysis of mitigation, adaptation, and <mark>climate</mark> amelioration options available to the global <mark>carbon</mark> industry is beyond the scope of this paper. A partial list includes developing <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage capacity (Allen et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR1"">2009a</A></SPAN>), funding adaptation programs (such as the UNFCCC Adaptation Fund), investing in or developing technologies and programs to realize the enormous global potential for efficient use of <mark>carbon</mark> fuels (Lovins <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR32"">2011</A></SPAN>), developing low- or zero-<mark>carbon</mark> alternative fuels and power generation systems, funding geo-engineering research, publicly committing to capture and store or remove <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide from the atmosphere commensurate with their historic emissions, supporting international <mark>climate</mark> diplomacy and domestic <mark>climate</mark> legislation (as leading multinational oil and gas companies have begun to do), and, in the event liability for historic and/or future emissions is not averted, setting aside financial reserves to cover potential <mark>climate</mark> liability claims. Greater transparency, including comprehensive reporting of all direct and product-related emissions, and full disclosure to investors of potential liabilities stemming from company operations or products, material risks to company assets, or material threats to future profits from <mark>climate change</mark> is warranted (Hancock <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR18"">2005</A></SPAN>; Coburn et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR9"">2011</A></SPAN>).</P><P class=""Para"">Focusing, for a moment, on the possibility of future efforts to capture and store <mark>carbon</mark>, note that most of the entities highlighted in this analysis have the technical and institutional capabilities necessary to lead research and development in <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage or to participate in other proactive <mark>climate</mark> mitigation programs. This analysis could provide a basis for calculating the amounts of <mark>carbon</mark> that would have to be captured and stored by various entities to compensate for their contributions to <mark>climate change</mark> to date, thus providing a factual basis for thinking through what a fair proposal might look like.</P><P class=""Para"">Finally, and perhaps most important, the extant <mark>carbon</mark> major entities discussed in this paper possess proven recoverable <mark>carbon</mark> reserves that will, if produced and emitted, intensify anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> and greatly exacerbate the social, political, and economic challenges related to it (<mark>Carbon</mark> Tracker <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR8"">2011</A></SPAN>). Analysis based on historic emissions can also be applied to each entity’s own <mark>carbon</mark> reserves and shares of its future <mark>carbon</mark> production that would need to be captured and stored (or offset by other means) in increasing percentages per annum (Allen et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR1"">2009a</A></SPAN>).</P><P class=""Para"">Indeed, the entities identified in this analysis hold two important assets—production capacity and proven recoverable reserves—that, together with profit motives and tax and regulatory incentives to discover and produce new fossil fuel reserves, hold the key to future fossil fuel production and emissions (Allen et al. <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR2"">2009b</A></SPAN>), and thus, arguably, the future of the planetary <mark>climate</mark> system. The International Energy Agency has concluded that “no more than one-third of proven reserves of fossil fuels can be consumed prior to 2050 if the world is to achieve the 2 °C goal” (IEA <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR28"">2012b</A></SPAN>); most of these reserves are in the hands of <mark>carbon</mark> majors. Redoubling international efforts to secure an effective <mark>climate</mark> agreement will likely prove insufficient unless some means can be found to involve the <mark>carbon</mark> majors in the effort to keep their reserves in the ground or commensurate efforts to prevent or offset their emission to the atmosphere.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""Sec8"" tabindex=""-1"" class=""Section1 RenderAsSection1 SectionTypeConclusion""><H2 class=""Heading""><SPAN class=""HeadingNumber"">8 </SPAN>Conclusion</H2><DIV class=""content""><P class=""Para"">The analysis presented here focuses attention on the commercial and state-owned entities responsible for producing the fossil fuels and cement that are the primary sources of anthropogenic greenhouse gases that are driving and will continue to drive <mark>climate change</mark>. The results show that nearly two-thirds of historic <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and methane emissions can be attributed to 90 entities.</P><P class=""Para"">This analysis offers a somewhat different perspective on the causes of and responsibility for dangerous anthropogenic interference in the <mark>climate</mark> system. Without minimizing the responsibility of Annex I nations, nor of China and India, often discussed, this analysis highlights the role of some non-Annex I nations, such Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Mexico, Iran, Kuwait, Abu Dhabi, Libya, Nigeria, Indonesia, Brazil, and other countries that have not been at the center of discussions regarding responsibility for controlling emissions. Some of these nations are, in their role as <mark>carbon</mark> producers, as important contributors to <mark>climate change</mark> as the Annex I nations who until now have been the focus of attention.</P><P class=""Para"">Most analyses to date, as well as the UNFCCC structure, consider responsibility for <mark>climate change</mark> in terms of nation-states. Such analyses fit the framework of international law, insofar as treaties and conventions are based on agreements between nation-states. However, responsibility can be understood in other ways as well, as done in the present analysis tracing emissions to major <mark>carbon</mark> producers. Shifting the perspective from nation-states to corporate entities—both investor-owned and state-owned companies—opens new opportunities for those entities to become part of the solution rather than passive (and profitable) bystanders to continued <mark>climate</mark> disruption. Future work (Heede and Oreskes, in prep.) will examine the question of ethical, political, and legal arguments to enlist or require these <mark>carbon</mark> majors in limiting further dangerous anthropogenic interference with the <mark>climate</mark> system. Social pressures may be brought to bear on investor-owned entities, which could work as an additional lever to push action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or removing CO<SUB>2</SUB> from the atmosphere. Regulation, litigation, and shareholder actions targeted at the private entities responsible for tobacco-related diseases played a significant role in the history of tobacco control; one could imagine comparable actions aimed at the private entities involved in the production of fossil fuels, particularly insofar as some of the entities included in this analysis have played a role in efforts to impede legislation that might slow the production and sale of <mark>carbon</mark> fuels. Energy companies have strong financial incentives to produce and market their booked reserves and oppose efforts to leave their valuable assets in the ground (Grantham <SPAN class=""CitationRef""><A href=""#CR17"">2012</A></SPAN>), but social and legal pressures may shift these incentives. Identifying who the major <mark>carbon</mark> producers are, and have been historically, may provide a useful basis for future social and legal pressure.</P></DIV></SECTION></DIV><SECTION id=""Notes"" class=""Section1 RenderAsSection1""><H2 class=""Heading"">Notes</H2><DIV class=""content""><SECTION><H3 class=""Heading"">Acknowledgments</H3><P class=""SimplePara"">I am very grateful to Naomi Oreskes, Brenda Ekwurzel, Peter Frumhoff, and Carroll Muffett for their insightful comments on this manuscript.

The report stated, &quot;<mark>Climate change</mark> and energy are two key issues that will play a significant role in shaping the future security environment,&quot; noting that &quot;<mark>climate change</mark>, energy security, and economic stability are inextricably linked.&quot; The report goes on to describe the vast geopolitical impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> anticipated by the intelligence community, including sea level rise, increasing temperatures, food and water scarcity, the proliferation of disease vectors, and the risk of mass migration by vulnerable populations to escape these impacts. These risks led DOD to declare that &quot;while <mark>climate change</mark> alone does not cause conflict, it may act as an accelerant of instability or conflict, placing a burden to respond on civilian institutions and militaries around the world.&quot; The department's leaders recognized that the United States' existing role in responding to extreme weather events, delivering humanitarian assistance, and preserving national security would be made all the more difficult by <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Since DOD's public call to action, the department has worked to better integrate <mark>climate</mark> risk across its operations and long-term planning. DOD has also pursued <mark>climate</mark> mitigation and adaptation measures in accordance with a broad set of Executive Branch initiatives designed to move the entire U.S. government towards a lower <mark>carbon</mark> footprint, more efficient resource consumption, and improved resilience against extreme weather events. The institutionalization of <mark>climate</mark> adaptation and mitigation measures has transformed how the department does business and has resulted in a more <mark>sustainable</mark> and agile military. Responsibilities for these measures have been distributed across the Pentagon for development and implementation and have been outlined in numerous memos, reports, and other official guidance. In addition, each of the five service branches has established its own clean energy goals to be achieved through physical infrastructure upgrades, as well as training to adjust behaviors and risk perception among its personnel.</P><P>This issue brief will cover the ways the U.S. military defines <mark>climate change</mark> risks and the subsequent challenges DOD will likely face going forward. Specific examples of global and domestic impacts and consequences are also explored. In addition, a high-level accounting of DOD and Congressional actions on <mark>climate</mark> and security is provided.</P><P> </P><H3><SPAN style=""color:#008080;"">Risks and Challenges</SPAN></H3><H4><SPAN style=""color:#008080;"">Department of Defense Considerations</SPAN></H4><TABLE cellpadding=""8"" cellspacing=""2"" frame=""void"" height=""169"" style=""border-top: 5px solid #008080; border-bottom: 5px solid #008080; text-align: left; margin-left: 5px; float: right;"" width=""272""><TBODY><TR><TD><P><I><mark>Climate change</mark> is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today.

For example, U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM) has cited future humanitarian crises tied to drought and disease as potential destabilizing events in that region. A region faced with severe water and food shortages may become more susceptible to having contributing elements of extremism and violence take root. The degradation or outright loss of land due to drought, erosion, and/or sea level rise can contribute to the threat multiplier equation through the displacement of people and the subsequent loss of a population's livelihood, housing, and agricultural capabilities. Warmer temperatures can also exacerbate the introduction and proliferation of heat-related illnesses and disease vectors, such as mosquitoes, into vulnerable regions. Humanitarian aid has the power to bring additional stability to impoverished nations, buffering them against natural disasters and political forces that may instigate conflict. Foreign investment in resilient infrastructure can allow vulnerable nations to better stand on their own and recover more quickly when disaster strikes.</P><P>Extreme weather events are projected to increase in severity and frequency over the next several decades and will place a greater burden on DOD units, personnel, and assets tasked with responding to such events and delivering humanitarian and disaster relief, both in the United States and abroad. For instance, DOD was a major player in responding to Typhoon Haiyan in 2015, providing substantial airlift support to deliver 750,000 pounds of supplies and 1,200 first responders, while extracting 5,640 storm victims to safety. Typical operations can also include the delivery of medical care, supplemental communications capabilities, electric grid repairs, water purification, and re-opening of shipping ports. At home, DOD mobilized 14,000 DOD personnel in direct response to Super Storm Sandy in 2012, with another 10,000 personnel providing additional assistance on infrastructure repair, debris removal, power restoration, and other services. Humanitarian assistance and disaster relief already poses a high fiscal cost for DOD and is primarily funded through the Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid (OHDACA) appropriation, which allows the GCCs to provide a rapid response to countries in need.</P><P>The consequences of <mark>climate change</mark> will likely heighten the risk DOD infrastructure already faces from severe weather events. DOD has expressed concern about how future conditions will affect the department's &quot;ability to maintain both its built and natural infrastructure and to ensure military readiness in the future.&quot; Beyond infrastructure damages, sea level rise and extreme weather could be particularly disruptive to training operations that rely on reliable access to land, air, and sea-based training facilities. To better understand these vulnerabilities, DOD has taken on a comprehensive internal assessment of <mark>climate</mark> impacts on its installations. DOD retains one of the largest real estate portfolios in the U.S. government, encompassing 562,000 buildings and structures distributed across 4,800 sites worldwide. This includes 293 active installations across the Army, Navy, and Air Force, in addition to numerous Coast Guard installations under the Department of Homeland Security. Extreme weather events could also hinder acquisition and supply chain operations that maintain these facilities, potentially influencing the types of equipment DOD acquires and the ways goods are transported, distributed, and stored.</P><P>The U.S. military will have to face the fallout of these impacts, given its operations in vulnerable and potentially volatile parts of the world. As these challenges manifest and worsen, DOD’s ability to meet its mission objectives will be strained, both at home and abroad. To succeed in the long-term, DOD must continue to adapt its operations, strategies, and physical infrastructure to a global environment shaped by <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><H4><SPAN style=""color:#008080;"">Risk Perception by Other Government Entities</SPAN></H4><P>DOD is not the only national security-oriented agency to be vocal about the multitude of risks <mark>climate change</mark> poses to its operations and assets. Leading voices within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) have repeatedly stressed the importance of responding and adapting to <mark>climate change</mark>, both in testimony before Congress and public speeches. In addition, numerous reports have been funded, commissioned, and published by these agencies that detail the security implications of <mark>climate change</mark>. These include CIA-backed reports from the National Research Council and Harvard University’s Center for the Environment, and the 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review, which covered <mark>climate</mark>-related threats in several sections.</P><P>In 2013, outgoing Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano warned that her successor would need to be prepared for more severe weather-related events as a result of <mark>climate change</mark>. This view was reaffirmed in a 2015 hearing for the House Committee on Homeland Security in which three senior DHS representatives, including the acting assistant secretary, described <mark>climate change</mark> as a threat multiplier and warned against disregarding its potential impact. Several former CIA directors have also highlighted the threat of <mark>climate change</mark>. Several former CIA directors have focused on the threat of <mark>climate change</mark> while in office, including John Brennan and Leon Panetta. Director Panetta in particular was a strong advocate of furthering <mark>climate</mark> research and oversaw the formation of the Center for <mark>Climate</mark> Security and the restart of Medea, a program where intelligence operatives and civilian scientists collaborated to better understand the impacts of environmental change, in 2010. The program gave scientists access to numerous classified intelligence assets, including observation satellites, sensors, and ocean and tidal readings from Navy submarines. Medea enabled scientists to better track and document <mark>climate change</mark> around the world and allowed for closer collaboration with national security agencies, but the program ended in 2015 when lawmakers, arguing that CIA assets should focus on more immediate security concerns, criticized it.</P><P>Both the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Government Accountability Office (GAO) have issued reports that detail the wide range of impacts <mark>climate change</mark> will likely have in the next several decades. A 2016 OMB report titled, “<mark>Climate Change</mark>: The Fiscal Risks Facing the Federal Government,” outlined five major fiscal risks for the United States that are directly related to <mark>climate change</mark>. These risks are crop insurance, health care, wildfire suppression, hurricane-related disaster relief, and federal facility flood risk, all of which are anticipated to cost billions of dollars more by the end of the century due to the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>. The GAO has issued numerous reports that identify potential <mark>climate</mark>-related threats to government assets, with just a sampling of potentially affected areas being public health, energy, defense, water infrastructure, federal and private insurers, federal supply chains, and federal fisheries. Furthermore, the 2017 edition of GAO's “High Risk List” included several government agencies and programs threatened by the direct or indirect effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, including the National Flood Insurance Program, the Nation’s Surface Transportation System, and gaps in weather satellite data.</P><P> </P><H3><SPAN style=""color:#008080;"">International Threats</SPAN></H3><H4><SPAN style=""color:#008080;"">Environmental Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons</SPAN></H4><P>One of the biggest risks posed by <mark>climate change</mark> is the potential for massive population displacement. This possibility is particularly concerning because people who are forced to migrate due to the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> do not currently meet the definition of a refugee, meaning they are left without the rights and legal protections conferred by such a classification. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has since proposed three classifications of “environmental migrants” to differentiate this unique subset: emergency migrants (people who temporarily flee a sudden environmental disaster), forced migrants (people who are currently directly impacted by long-term environmental factors), and motivated migrants (people who seek to avoid future environmental hazards). <mark>Climate change</mark> threatens to dramatically increase the number of both refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), creating additional strains on the humanitarian and economic capabilities of the United States and other countries around the world. <mark>Climate change</mark> is also unique in that the losses inflicted upon a population's homeland (whether from sea level rise, desertification, flooding, or a surge in deadly heat conditions) is most likely permanent. While refugees of war may one day be able to return, environmental refugees could face permanent displacement.</P><P>Joseph Cassidy, the former Director for Policy, Regional, and Functional Organizations at the U.S. Department of State, identified three categories of risk associated with <mark>climate</mark>-induced migration and displacement and how governments respond: <B>direct risks</B>, <B>indirect risks</B>, and <B>third-order risks</B>. <B>Direct risks</B> would include an increased need for border security and global humanitarian assistance, the latter being of particular concern to DOD given the large role it plays in such efforts. <B>Indirect risks</B>, such as disruptions to the global economy brought on by mass migration, would also have significant ramifications for the United States. <B>Third-order risks</B> would primarily be conflicts sparked or worsened by an influx of <mark>climate</mark> migrants, exemplifying <mark>climate change</mark> as a threat multiplier.</P><P>Examples of the devastating impacts <mark>climate</mark>-related migration could have on the social, economic, and political stability of countries are abundant today. Perhaps one of the most well-known examples is the conflict beginning in 2003 in Sudan's Darfur region, which has been partly attributed to <mark>climate</mark>- and drought-related migration that led to competition for scarce resources before escalating into a full-scale war. Syria's ongoing civil war emerged in 2011 and holds parallels to Darfur. Syria's historically severe drought stretching from 2006 to 2010 acted as one of multiple contributing factors that led to migration, civil unrest, and ultimately armed conflict. Scientists concluded that a prolonged drought of this severity became more than twice as likely to strike Syria due to impacts from anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><H4><SPAN style=""color:#008080;"">Water Conflict</SPAN></H4><P>Another major impact of <mark>climate change</mark> on the international stage will be on water supply and the increased likelihood of intra- and inter-state conflict over this finite resource. Beyond being a basic life necessity, water is also crucial for enabling agriculture and energy generation. Although struggles over water resources are not a new occurrence, <mark>climate change</mark> will only intensify and increase the frequency of such issues—similar to migration. A 2012 report from the Office of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence warned that when water problems combine with “poverty, social tensions, environmental degradation, ineffectual leadership, and weak political institutions,” social disruptions and the threat of a failed state may emerge.</P><P>The report notes that North Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia are all likely to face major challenges coping with water-related issues such as water shortages, poor water quality, and floods by 2040. This is primarily due to water management concerns regarding key river basins in these regions, such as the Nile, Tigris-Euphrates, and Indus. A number of threats could materialize, including degraded food security, reduced flood resilience, and greater public health risks, if these issues were to go unaddressed. In rating the management capacity for seven different river basins in these hot spots based on the “strength and resilience&quot; of their governance mechanisms, the report cautioned that &quot;even well-prepared river basins are likely to be challenged by increased water demand and impacts from <mark>climate change</mark>.&quot; Only two of the seven river basins received favorable ratings for their ability to avoid and manage future crises, with the other five receiving capacity ratings of “limited” or “inadequate.&quot;</P><P>Severe water scarcity could also lead to the “weaponization of water.” According to a report on water issues by the Center for <mark>Climate</mark> and Security, the Middle East and Africa are particularly susceptible to sub-national and trans-national conflicts when groups use water resources to further their own interests. The report identifies three types of weaponization: strategic, tactical, and coercive, all of which are already underpinning conflicts today. The Islamic State used both strategic and tactical weaponization when it threatened to destroy a major dam in Mosul and diverted water to stop the advancement of the Iraqi Army, respectively. A notable example of coercive weaponization comes from Al-Shabaab, which cut off water to cities in Somalia to demonstrate its power. As water weaponization tactics continue to be used by groups the U.S. military is actively opposing, policies to bolster weakened governments and strengthen national water policies could prove to be a valuable toolkit for implementing American foreign policy.</P><H4><SPAN style=""color:#008080;"">Arctic Access</SPAN></H4><P>The Arctic Ocean presents one of the most distinct connections between the way global warming is simultaneously changing the natural environment and long-standing geo-political relationships. In 2016, the annually-averaged ocean surface temperature for the world was 1.35 degrees Fahrenheit (0.75 degrees Celsius) higher than the 20th century average, continuing a steady climb in ocean surface temperatures over the past three decades. Record ocean temperatures have contributed to a decline in sea ice levels. In 2017, scientists observed the lowest combined levels of Arctic and Antarctic sea ice levels since satellite observations began nearly 40 years ago, with the Arctic's minimum sea ice extent decreasing 13.5 percent per decade since 1979. The absence of ice will unlock previously inaccessible navigation routes and will open the possibility for oil and natural gas extraction. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, 30 percent of the world's undiscovered natural gas and 13 percent of its undiscovered oil may be located north of the Arctic Circle, most of it offshore. The opportunity to engage in commerce through new trade routes and to stake old territorial claims on portions of the sea bed for mineral, oil, and natural gas extraction has drawn the attention of many competing nations, including those without a historical presence in the Arctic region.</P><P>According to a 2014 assessment by the U.S. Navy, there is a low chance these nations will come into armed conflict over Arctic claims. Indeed, the U.S. Navy has characterized the Arctic as a &quot;challenging operating environment, with a harsh <mark>climate</mark>, vast distances, and little infrastructure.&quot; However, the report advises that the United States maintain a watchful presence in the region due to the possible tensions that could flare up given the value of the resources being contested. International collaborative bodies, such as the eight-nation Arctic Council, provide a forum to discuss how to adapt to regional <mark>climate</mark> impacts, coordinate with stakeholders, and bring together national ministers to discuss common goals, helping to ensure cooperation and transparency will continue to be a part of Arctic development in the future. Yet, the United States could be at a disadvantage in keeping up with the shifting balance of power in an increasingly ice-free Arctic. Despite being an Arctic nation, the United States currently lacks the operational assets that will be needed to deal with the surge in commercial (and possibly military) vessels traversing northern waters. While naval submarine units are experienced in Arctic operations, the U.S. military's surface and air forces are not as seasoned. The United States has only a single, aged icebreaker in operation, compared to 27 ocean-going icebreakers under the Russian flag.</P><TABLE cellpadding=""8"" cellspacing=""2"" frame=""void"" height=""250"" style=""border-top: 5px solid rgb(0, 128, 128); border-bottom: 5px solid rgb(0, 128, 128); text-align: left; margin-right: 15px; margin-left: 5px; float: left;"" width=""291""><TBODY><TR><TD><P><I>If we fail to act upon <mark>climate change</mark>, instability around the globe will inevitably intensify, and even our bases will risk being lost.

			Ray Mabus</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>Due to the rapid environmental changes occurring across the Arctic, DOD anticipates having to take a more active role in managing future risks and ensuring their facilities and personnel are resilient to those changes. The development of Arctic shipping and extraction, for instance, will likely increase the need for rescue operations, which is of particular concern to DOD. Other federal, state, local, and tribal entities, as well as allied nations, are also involved in responding to disasters in conjunction with DOD given their geographic proximity and capabilities. The U.S. Navy's 2009 Arctic Roadmap, updated in 2014, is one of the major guiding documents behind the military's efforts to integrate <mark>climate</mark> impacts on the Arctic Ocean into DOD's operations, procurement, and strategic planning. Additional analysis, such as a 2016 report to Congress on strategies for protecting national security interests in the Arctic, offers insight into how DOD perceives its limitations and projected challenges in this remote region. Extreme cold and adverse weather conditions, constrained mobility and navigation capabilities, limited communication tools, and insufficient mapping for terrain and waterways conspire to make basic operations in the Arctic a challenge for military units. Personnel would also require specialized training and equipment to adapt to and successfully operate in the harsh conditions.</P><P> </P><H3><SPAN style=""color:#008080;"">Threats to U.S. Military Facilities</SPAN></H3><P>
DOD has been working to better understand and prepare for the risks <mark>climate change</mark> poses to its facilities and built infrastructure around the world. The vast geographic distribution of these facilities, their often advanced age, and the less severe environmental conditions they were originally built to withstand has been a cause for grave concern among base commanders. Extreme weather events—flooding, drought, and wildfire—all pose a real threat to DOD's assets. Damage inflicted upon defense facilities and the interdependent assets they host (such as aircraft, hangars, and radar equipment) can cripple the military's ability to respond to a crisis, in addition to costing taxpayers millions of dollars to repair and replace these resources. Changes to installation landscapes can compromise military training grounds meant to simulate realistic field conditions, such as deserts or amphibious landing zones. Hazardous temperatures and storms can also disrupt scheduled training activities and put personnel at risk.</P><P>DOD leaders have advocated for greater <mark>climate</mark> resilience across the service branches through updated emergency planning, the hardening of infrastructure, and commonsense solutions to avoid loss and damage. Considering DOD's global real-estate portfolio has an estimated replacement value of roughly $850 billion, spread across 555,000 buildings, on 28 million acres of land, the potential cost of <mark>climate change</mark> impacts would likely be severe if left unaddressed. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requested all federal agencies to account for <mark>climate change</mark> when preparing their budget requests for Fiscal Year 2017, including building and infrastructure proposals. DOD has begun accounting for <mark>climate change</mark> threats in its short- and long-term installation planning, supply chain management, and training, as documented in its 2014 <mark>Climate Change</mark> Adaptation Roadmap. DOD also has undertaken a baseline assessment of its facilities to better understand which sites are the most vulnerable and may require additional protections or even relocation in order to sustain operations as <mark>climate</mark> impacts begin to exact a steady toll in the future.</P><P>The discussion on national security and <mark>climate</mark> resilience should also involve local officials and residents who live near military bases. These communities often house many active-duty and civilian personnel who work on-base and have strong economic ties with the military's presence. Vital infrastructure, such as roads, electricity, and water, are often shared between towns and bases. There is a strong connection between bases across America and the adjacent communities found &quot;beyond the gate.&quot; These relationships foster deep economic benefits across the local economy, but also present underlying challenges in the event of a natural disaster or other disruption. In the same way a company's productivity suffers when its employees are unable to make it to the office, DOD operations can be severely hindered if staff are unable to safely and reliably travel from their homes to the base. These facilities rely upon more than just uniformed personnel to operate at full capacity. Support services ranging from security to food service to information technology may be carried out by civilian employees, who number 742,000 (compared to 1.3 million active duty personnel). Given the shared risks posed by <mark>climate</mark> impacts, future partnerships between base managers and local government leaders could be mutually beneficial. The joint-development of natural disaster response plans could improve public safety, while investment in <mark>climate</mark>-resilient infrastructure projects could stimulate the local economy and improve assets used on a daily basis by residents and base personnel alike.</P><P>Members of Congress who have previously sought to decouple <mark>climate change</mark> considerations from national security planning are beginning to show a greater openness toward backing institutional solutions to these challenges. In June 2017, the House Armed Services Committee passed an amendment to DOD's annual appropriations bill that would require each of the service branches to report to Congress their ten military facilities deemed most vulnerable to <mark>climate change</mark> over the next 20 years. The amendment, which passed by a voice vote, also stated in clear terms that “<mark>climate change</mark> is a direct threat to the national security of the United States and is impacting stability in areas of the world both where the United States Armed Forces are operating today, and where strategic implications for future conflict exist.” A proposal to strip the amendment language from the bill was later struck down by a recorded vote of 185-234 on the House floor.</P><P> </P><H4><SPAN style=""color:#008080;"">DOD Service Branch Actions and Proposals</SPAN></H4><H5><SPAN style=""color:#008080;"">The Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard</SPAN></H5><TABLE cellpadding=""8"" cellspacing=""2"" frame=""void"" height=""108"" style=""border-top: 5px solid #008080; border-bottom: 5px solid #008080; text-align: left; margin-left: 5px; float: right;"" width=""408""><TBODY><TR><TD><P><I>The largest growing demand on the battlefield today is for electricity and how we create that.

Conway</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>The Navy has long been at the forefront of <mark>climate change</mark> awareness and integrated <mark>climate</mark> considerations into its strategic planning years before DOD-wide policies were enacted. The Navy established Task Force <mark>Climate Change</mark> (TFCC) in 2009 in response to changing conditions in the Arctic and other regions due to <mark>climate change</mark>. TFCC would go on to publish the Navy’s 2009 Arctic Roadmap, which served as the key operating guide for the far north until the publication of a DOD-wide Arctic Roadmap in 2014. TFCC also published a broader <mark>Climate Change</mark> Roadmap in 2010, two years before the first DOD-wide edition was released, which outlined three phases of <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation. The phases called for improved climatic prediction capabilities, the integration of <mark>climate</mark> impacts into academic training exercises and strategic guidance documents, investments in resilient infrastructure, and partnerships to position the military to better respond to <mark>climate change</mark>. The Navy’s “Energy Vision for the 21st Century,” released in 2010, laid out numerous alternative energy-related goals, including drawing half its energy consumption afloat from non-petroleum sources by 2020. Among these goals was a significant push by the Navy to develop, test, and deploy drop-in biofuels for its supply chain to lessen DOD's reliance on petroleum. After a series of smaller-scale field tests beginning in 2012, the &quot;Great Green Fleet&quot; deployed for a year in 2016 and featured a Carrier Strike Group and other naval platforms running on a 10 percent biodiesel blend derived from waste beef fat. Ships participating in the tests also used a variety of energy-efficient technologies and modifications, allowing them to stay deployed longer than conventional vessels by cutting their refueling frequency.</P><P>The other two members of the United States’“sea services,” the Marine Corps and Coast Guard, are also actively working to address the operational challenges of <mark>climate change</mark>. Although the Coast Guard operates under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), it remains a key partner of DOD. Like the Navy, the Coast Guard has published an Arctic Strategy and has concentrated most of its efforts on increasing its operational capacity in the Arctic as the region continues to open up due to reductions in sea ice cover.</P><P>The Marine Corps has been particularly focused on energy efficiency and supply chain vulnerabilities. The USMC Expeditionary Energy Office (E2O) was established in 2009 to develop and help implement guidance to reduce the service's dependence on fossil fuels for both expeditionary forces and permanent installations. Drawing upon lessons from Afghanistan, Marine Corps leadership recognized the high rate of fuel consumption for its expeditionary forces and the life-threatening risks faced by supply convoys tasked with meeting energy needs in remote areas. To better understand these challenges, the Marines conducted the first-ever energy audit in a combat zone in 2009. The results of the audit informed later efforts to reduce electricity and liquid fuel demand through the use of energy efficient structures and renewable energy technologies. In 2009, an annual Expeditionary Energy Concepts (E2C) exercise was initiated to further reduce energy and water demand for units in the field, thus extending their operational capabilities. The week-long event allows Marines to field test new technologies alongside engineers, who collect feedback and data.</P><P> </P><H5><SPAN style=""color:#008080;"">The Army</SPAN></H5><P>The Army also has taken an active stance on addressing <mark>climate change</mark>, with many of these actions originating in broader DOD directives or presidential executive orders. The Net Zero Initiative was launched in 2011 as a pilot program to encourage a number of installations to create as much energy as they use by 2020, with the goal of having 25 such installations by 2030. As of 2015, there were nine facilities participating in the energy program, in addition to eight Net Zero waste and eight Net Zero water bases, located in the United States and abroad. In setting up the initiatives, the Army cited the environmental and security benefits of having its facilities consume fewer resources, while recognizing the importance of allowing each base to tailor its own distinct approach to achieving its sustainability goals.</P><P>A major force behind the Army's pursuit of cleaner energy sources is the Office of Energy Initiatives (OEI). Established in 2014 by the Secretary of the Army, OEI is the department's primary management office for renewable and alternative energy projects, which must have a minimum generating capacity of 10 megawatts. The office leverages the Army's vast acquisition network and private sector financing to build new renewable energy projects both on and adjacent to Army facilities. OEI's mission seeks to preserve base operational capabilities during a potential grid disruption, while also working toward the Army's mandate to draw 25 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025, in accordance with the 2007 <I>National Defense Authorization Act</I>. As of 2017, there are 17 facilities across the country hosting OEI-backed projects in various stages of development, including 60 MW of biomass generation at Ft. Drum, NY; 50 MW of wind at Ft. Hood, TX; 30 MW of solar at Ft. Benning, GA; and 14 MW of solar at Camp Shelby, MS. Several of the projects are classified as &quot;islandable,&quot; meaning they feature electricity generation, energy storage, and controls all onsite. The Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) first issued a <mark>Climate Change</mark> Adaptation Plan in 2011 and has updated the document four times in accordance with executive orders calling for the development of a comprehensive <mark>climate change</mark> strategy for federal agencies. USACE's adaptation guidance largely focuses on preparing the agency's water management practices, built infrastructure, and other services to better withstand anticipated <mark>climate</mark> impacts.</P><P> </P><H5><SPAN style=""color:#008080;"">The Air Force</SPAN></H5><P>The Air Force, meanwhile, is mostly in the assessment and planning stage of addressing <mark>climate change</mark>. The Air Force Special Operations Command noted the effect <mark>climate change</mark> may have in amplifying global conflicts and natural resource pressures, thus making strategic environments more challenging for special forces to operate in. A 2014 order from the Secretary of the Air Force directed the Air Force Encroachment Management Program (AFEM) to account for short- and long-term &quot;natural factors and <mark>climate</mark> effects&quot; that may impact the operational capacity of installations and the quality of life of the surrounding communities. The order cites <mark>climate</mark>-related water restrictions, coastal flooding, wildfires, severe weather, and an influx of invasive species as examples of <mark>climate</mark> impacts program managers may have to consider. The Air Force has also included <mark>climate change</mark> vulnerability metrics in its comprehensive planning guidelines for installations. Coastal erosion accelerated by melting permafrost and extreme weather prompted the Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC) to conduct coastal erosion studies to determine the risks to Air Force airfields and radar stations located in Alaska. The study could help inform future land use planning for the Air Force's vulnerable early-warning infrastructure in the region. Cape Canaveral Air Force Station has partnered with NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida to identify vulnerable infrastructure across the two facilities and develop a set of <mark>climate</mark> adaptation strategies. The effort examined how future hurricanes and storm surges may be amplified by <mark>climate change</mark> and the risks these events could pose to resources relied upon by the Air Force's 45th Space Wing.</P><H4><SPAN style=""color:#008080;"">Past Congressional Actions and Proposals</SPAN></H4><P>Despite widespread agreement among the scientific, and more recently military, communities on the grave and growing risk of <mark>climate change</mark>, Congressional action has resulted in relatively few concrete policy proposals and even fewer successfully-passed bills. Although the concept of <mark>climate change</mark> as a threat multiplier has been common operating knowledge for over a decade now, some of the more enduring <mark>climate</mark>-security policies have come in the form of budget authorizations housed within broader fiscal authorization acts for the defense and intelligence communities.</P><TABLE cellpadding=""8"" cellspacing=""2"" frame=""void"" height=""147"" style=""border-top: 5px solid #008080; border-bottom: 5px solid #008080; text-align: left; margin-left: 5px; float: right;"" width=""325""><TBODY><TR><TD><P><I>In my 30 years in the U.S. Senate, I have not seen an issue as complicated as the challenges posed by national security, energy, and <mark>climate change</mark>.</I></P><P style=""text-align: right;"">̶  former Senate Armed Services Committee Chair
			John Warner</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>The <I>National Defense Authorization Act</I> (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2008 was among the first bills to include specific directives to study the security implications of <mark>climate change</mark>. Its passage into law resulted in the landmark inclusion of <mark>climate</mark>-related concerns in the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review, which has since served as a key guidance document for DOD's <mark>climate</mark> mitigation and adaptation policies. As part of the DOD Appropriations Bill for FY2015, the Senate Appropriations Committee ordered the department to deliver a report to Congress identifying the most significant <mark>climate</mark>-related security risks for the Geographic Combatant Commands, resulting in the July 2015 report, &quot;National Security Implications of <mark>Climate</mark>-Related Risks and a Changing <mark>Climate</mark>.&quot; However, the House version of the NDAA for FY2017 expressly forbids any of its appropriated funds from being used to implement <mark>climate</mark> adaptation measures, which the Pentagon had previously outlined in an official directive. Tensions arising from the military's desire to insulate its operations from <mark>climate</mark> risks and the fiscal priorities of influential groups within Congress will likely color future national security budget negotiations. Notably, the NDAA for FY2018 was signed into law with language ordering the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to Congress within a year detailing the ten most <mark>climate</mark>-vulnerable installations for each service branch.</P><P>Congress has also issued resolutions recognizing the national security risks of <mark>climate change</mark>. Since at least 2005, there have been numerous congressional resolutions that have either acknowledged the threat, expressed a commitment to addressing it, or proposed solutions. However, none of these resolutions has garnered enough support in either chamber to gain passage, despite the bipartisan nature of the proposals.</P><P>Bills are among the most frequently used vehicles for <mark>climate</mark>-related policy proposals. Major legislation that has sought to act on the idea of <mark>climate change</mark> as a threat multiplier in recent years includes the <I>Global <mark>Climate Change</mark> Security Oversight Act</I> of 2007, the <I>Lieberman-Warner <mark>Climate</mark> Security Act</I> of 2007, and the <I>American Clean Energy and Security Act</I> of 2009.

That reporting ignited investigations by state attorneys general that are still in litigation.</P><P>&quot;On the question of whether ExxonMobil misled non-scientific audiences about <mark>climate</mark> science, our analysis supports the conclusion that it did,&quot; Geoffrey Supran and Naomi Oreskes of Harvard University wrote in the study, published today in the scientific journal <EM>Environmental Research Letters</EM>.</P><P>Across the board, the paper found &quot;a systematic discrepancy between what ExxonMobil's scientists and executives discussed about <mark>climate change</mark> privately and in academic circles and what it presented to the general public,&quot; the authors said.</P><P>&quot;ExxonMobil contributed quietly to the science and loudly to raising doubts about it,&quot; they wrote.</P><P>The authors explicitly rejected Exxon's main defense, which was to claim that journalists were &quot;cherry picking&quot; the company's record and that its positions had always been in step with the state of the science. The company often said that anyone who read the full documentary record would see matters Exxon's way.</P><P>The Harvard researchers said their task was to accept Exxon's challenge to review the full record. Among the documents they examined were dozens cited in ICN's work, as well as more than 50 scientific papers Exxon frequently mentioned in its own defense and its issue advertising.</P><P>Supran and Oreskes called their conclusions &quot;an expansive, quantitative, independent corroboration of the findings of investigative journalists.&quot;</P><P>In an interview, Supran said the evidence was unambiguous.</P><P>The authors reviewed 187 public and internal Exxon documents over the past four decades, including many that were brought to light by ICN's reporting.</P><P>In one finding, they judged that 83 percent of peer-reviewed papers written by company scientists and 80 percent of the company's internal communications acknowledged that <mark>climate change</mark> is real and caused by humans.

In February 2002, President Bush committed the United States to a comprehensive strategy to reduce
the greenhouse gas emission intensity of the American economy by 18 percent by 2012. Meeting this
commitment will prevent more than 500 million metric tons of <mark>carbon</mark>-equivalent emissions through
2012, the equivalent of taking 70 million cars off the road. This step will set America on a path to slow
the growth of our greenhouse gas emissions and, as science justifies, to stop and then reverse the
growth of emissions.
<H3><A name=""3"">Cabinet Committee on <mark>Climate Change</mark> Science and Technology Integration</A></H3>

Recognizing the importance of the <mark>climate change</mark> issue, President Bush has created an interagency,
Cabinet-level committee, co-chaired by the Secretaries of Commerce and Energy, to coordinate and
prioritize Federal research on global <mark>climate</mark> science and advance cleaner energy technologies. This
Committee develops policy recommendations for the President and oversees the sub-cabinet
interagency programs on <mark>climate</mark> science and energy technologies.
<H3><A name=""4"">Federal <mark>Climate</mark> Science Program</A></H3>

The President requests nearly $2 billion in his FY 2005 budget for <mark>climate</mark> science research, with $238
million for the <mark>Climate Change</mark> Research Initiative (CCRI), a 42 percent increase over the FY 2004
enacted level. Energy Secretary Abraham, Commerce Secretary Evans, and White House Science
Adviser Marburger released a 10-Year comprehensive Strategic Plan for the U.S. <mark>Climate Change</mark>


<P>Science Program in July 2003. The plan describes a strategy for developing
knowledge of variability and change in <mark>climate</mark> and related environmental and
human systems, and for encouraging the application of this knowledge.
Secretary Evans also announced a $103 million two-year Federal initiative to
accelerate the deployment of new global observation technologies, focused on
oceans, atmospheric aerosols, and the <mark>carbon</mark> cycle. After reviewing the
Strategic Plan, the National Research Council commended its scope and
content, stating that [t]he plan articulates a guiding vision, is appropriately
ambitious, and is broad in scope. It encompasses activities related to areas of
longstanding importance as well as new or enhanced cross disciplinary efforts.
Advancing science on all fronts identified by the program will be of vital
importance to the nation.</P><H3><A name=""5"">Greenhouse Gas Reduction Initiatives</A></H3>

The Federal Government administers many different voluntary programs on energy efficiency,
agricultural practices, and greenhouse gas reductions. Major initiatives announced by the Bush
Administration include:

<P><STRONG><mark>Climate</mark> VISION Partnership</STRONG>: In February 2003, President Bush announced that
companies from twelve major industrial sectors and the membership of the Business
Roundtable had committed to work with four of his Cabinet agencies (DOE, EPA,
DOT, and USDA) to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in the next decade.
Participating industries included Americas electric utilities; petroleum refiners and
natural gas producers; automobile, iron and steel, chemical and magnesium
manufacturers; forest and paper producers; railroads; and the cement, mining,
aluminum, and semiconductor industries. In December 2003, the Department of Energy established
an official <mark>Climate</mark> VISION Web site (www.<mark>climate</mark>vision.gov) to serve as an information clearinghouse
for the program.</P><P><STRONG><mark>Climate</mark> Leaders:</STRONG> Announced in 2002, <mark>Climate</mark> Leaders is an EPA
partnership encouraging individual companies to develop long-term,
comprehensive <mark>climate change</mark> strategies. Partners set corporate-wide
GHG reduction goals and inventory their emissions to measure progress. Fifty major companies are
now participating, including General Motors, Alcoa, BP, Pfizer, Staples, International Paper, IBM,
Miller Brewing, Eastman Kodak, and Target.</P><H3><A name=""6"">Targeted Incentives for Greenhouse Gas Sequestration</A></H3><P>In June 2003, Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman announced that consideration will be given to
conservation practices that store <mark>carbon</mark> when implementing USDAs forest and agriculture
conservation programs, such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and
Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). USDA would provide financial incentives, technical assistance,
demonstrations, pilot programs, education and capacity building, along with measurements to assess the
success of these efforts.</P><H3><A name=""7"">Proposed Guidelines for Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions</A></H3>

In December 2003, DOE proposed guidelines for the voluntary reporting of greenhouse gas emissions
and reduction efforts under the program established by section 1605(b) of the Energy Policy Act of
1992. By encouraging complete reports on the greenhouse gas emissions of all participants in the
program, these guidelines would improve the accuracy and verifiability of greenhouse gas emission data
reported under the registry. In addition, the revised guidelines will provide a means for entities that are
able to meet these additional requirements to register greenhouse gas emissions reductions, and gain
recognition for their efforts to help meet the President's goal for reducing U.S. emissions intensity by
18 percent between 2002 and 2012. Through this program, major U.S. companies and institutions will
be encouraged to comprehensively review and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. This proposal is
another key component of the Bush Administrations efforts to address the complex, important issue
of global <mark>climate change</mark>.

both through multilateral and bilateral activities. Multilaterally, the United States is by far the largest
financial provider for the activities of the UN Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark> and the
Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>. The United States also leads R &amp; D projects through the
Generation IV International Forum, which is developing the next generation nuclear systems to
produce electricity without emitting greenhouse gases. Bilaterally, the United States has developed a
number of agreements with major international partners to pursue research on global <mark>climate change</mark>
and deploy <mark>climate</mark> observation systems, collaborate on energy and sequestration technologies, and
explore methodologies for monitoring and measuring GHG emissions. To date, new bilateral
agreements have been established with countries representing over 70 percent of global greenhouse gas
emissions: Australia, Japan, China, India, Italy, Canada, Russia, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand,
Mexico, the European Union, Brazil, CONCAUSA, an organization of seven Central American
countries, and South Africa.

<P><STRONG>Earth Observation Summit:</STRONG> The first-ever Earth
Observation Summit was held July 31, 2003, to generate
strong, international support to link thousands of individual
technological assets into a coordinated, sustained, and
comprehensive global Earth observation system. The
purpose of the system is to provide the observations needed
to substantially improve our ability to identify and address
critical environmental, economic, and societal concerns. Throughout the world, individual systems
have already demonstrated their value, from
estimating crop yields to monitoring water and
air quality to improving airline safety. We have
limited knowledge, however, of how to address
concerns such as drought, disease outbreaks,
stronger agricultural production, and energy
and transportation challenges. International
cooperation can provide the tools needed to
address these scientific uncertainties. More
than 30 countries and 20 international organizations participated in the Summit. Participants adopted a Summit Declaration recognizing the
need to minimize data gaps and maximize the utility of the observations, and established an
intergovernmental group to develop the implementation plan.</P><P>The second Earth Observation Summit was held in Tokyo in April 2004. NOAA administrator
Admiral Conrad Lautenbacher and EPA administrator Michael Leavitt both represented the United

      <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""mailto:scarignan@bna.com"">Sylvia Carignan</A></I></P><P>EPA cleanup policies may not be enough to protect human health as contaminants from
   Superfund sites threaten to spread in Hurricane Harvey’s aftermath, community advocates
   and <mark>climate change</mark> groups say.
</P><P>Environmental Protection Agency plans have cut <mark>climate change</mark> preparedness efforts,
   years after acknowledging the threats that <mark>climate change</mark> and severe weather pose
   to Superfund sites in a 2014 agency report. Meanwhile, community advocates at two
   Superfund sites hit by Hurricane Harvey say floodwaters likely have swept contaminants
   outside secured perimeters, into communities and bodies of water, as a result of insufficient
   remedies. 
</P><P>At the San Jacinto River Waste Pits Superfund site outside Houston, Lois Gibbs, founder
   of the Center for Health, Environment and Justice, suspects a protective “temporary”
   cover placed over contaminated waste may not be holding up.
</P><P>On-site inspections won’t be possible until the water recedes, but the cap “has been
   effective in safeguarding the site,” according to a statement from International Paper,
   McGinnes Industrial Maintenance Corp., and Waste Management, Inc., all companies involved
   in the cleanup efforts.
</P><P>The EPA started assessing storm damage at affected Superfund sites Aug. 30, but has
   not specified which properties it has reviewed. According to an agency spokesperson,
   the EPA plans to assess 31 sites that may have been affected by the hurricane.
</P><P>There are 13 federal Superfund

</P><H5><mark>Climate Change</mark></H5><P>Superfund sites in Region 6, which covers New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma,
   and Arkansas, could face flooding from more intense, more frequent storms that may
   lead to contaminant releases, according to a 2014 EPA report.
</P><P>“With hurricanes affecting the Gulf of Mexico coast perhaps being more powerful, coupled
   with an expected increase in extreme precipitation events, emergency response in Region
   6 will be further challenged,” the

</P><P>The agency hasn’t been able to fully implement its plans to deal with those threats
   at Superfund sites. 
</P><P>“Most cleanup plans haven’t addressed <mark>climate change</mark>,” Barbara Maco, vice president
   of the U.S. <mark>Sustainable</mark> Remediation Forum Board of Trustees said. And the EPA’s five-year
   reviews of Superfund sites on whether the chosen remedy still protects human and environmental
   health “don’t specifically address <mark>climate change</mark>.” 
</P><P>Maco said it’s “not surprising” that hurricane-affected sites in the Houston area
   may need further remediation as a result of storm damage.
</P><P>Under Administrator Scott Pruitt, the EPA Office of Land and Emergency Management
   omitted the plan from a 2017 draft guidance 
   <A class=""bluenobold"" href=""https://www.epa.gov/planandbudget/draft-fy-2018-2019-office-land-and-emergency-management-olem-npm-guidance"">document</A> for national program managers, proposing to cut it altogether.
</P><P>“There’s a general concern that <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation will be neglected going
   forward,” John Simon, president of the forum’s board, told Bloomberg BNA.
</P><P>Regarding the EPA’s <mark>climate change</mark> plan, an EPA spokesperson said “the agency is refocusing
   its efforts on a comprehensive back-to-basics strategy that maintains core environmental
   protection with respect to statutory and regulatory obligations.”
</P><P>The agency plans to release the final version of that draft guidance document at the
   end of September.
</P><H5>San Jacinto River</H5><P>The San Jacinto River Waste Pits Superfund site outside Houston has impounded paper-mill
   waste. In the early 2000s, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality found dioxins
   and furans in sediment, fish, and crabs.
</P><P>“The original way they found out the pits were leaking was through a similar storm
   many years ago,” Gibbs told Bloomberg BNA, “and the dioxin washed up into the properties
   there.” 
</P><P>The EPA’s proposed remediation plan for the San Jacinto River site acknowledges the
   potential for flooding and changes in the river’s path to make containment options
   unreliable. An armored cap placed on some of the waste in 2011 has needed periodic
   repairs.
</P><P>Removing the waste would “eliminate the possibility of a catastrophic release that
   could result in a much more severe impact to the environment,” the proposed plan said.
   “The possibility of long-term and extensive flooding, even permanent submersion, could
   affect the integrity of engineered remedies at some sites where waste has been consolidated
   and remains in place.” 
</P><P>The proposed plan to remove the contaminants from the site would cost nearly $100
   million. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality opposes EPA’s proposed plan,
   particularly the cost and what it views as inadequate short-term risk evaluations.
</P><P>The San Jacinto River site is one of nine where Pruitt will have the final word on
   the remedial plan.
</P><H5>Many Diversified Interests, Inc</H5><P>The EPA is also working to remediate the Many Diversified Interests, Inc. Superfund
   site in Houston, but Hurricane Harvey has inundated the property.
</P><P>“There are these massive pools of water sitting on the actual site,” said Yvette Arellano,
   spokesperson for Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services, which is tracking
   progress of remediation at the site.
</P><P>The agency divided the remediation process to separately address groundwater contamination
   and the site’s soil contamination, and determined that groundwater cleanup was complete
   and deleted that portion of the site from the National Priorities List.
</P><P>The EPA did remove lead-contaminated soil from about 150 homes, according to agency
   records. But Arellano said homes are sitting on cinderblocks in the nearby community
   and the EPA did not test for lead underneath them. 
</P><P>“Even though they sat low to the ground, it still means there’s contamination under
   those homes,” she said.
</P><P>The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality will start inspecting affected sites
   when they’re able to enter them, according to a statement.

This guidance replaces current guidance which requires tax benefits that exceed compensation costs (windfalls) to be recognized in equity. The new guidance will also change the cash flow presentation of excess tax benefits, classifying them as operating inflows rather than financing activities as they are currently classified. In addition, the new guidance will allow companies to provide net settlement of stock-based compensation to cover tax withholding as long as the net settlement doesn't exceed the maximum individual statutory tax rate in the employee's tax jurisdiction. Amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements, forfeitures, and intrinsic value should be applied using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted. Amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares to meet the minimum statutory withholding requirement should be applied retrospectively. Amendments requiring recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement and the practical expedient for estimating expected term should be applied prospectively.

That was definitely the case for leading pulp and paper supplier <STRONG>International Paper </STRONG><SPAN class=""ticker"" data-id=""204041"">(<A href=""https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/international-paper/ip"">NYSE:IP</A>)</SPAN> last year, which showered investors total returns of 47% -- several times greater than the gains delivered by the <STRONG>S&amp;P 500</STRONG>. Then again, the incredible run-up in stock price followed an epic collapse at the end of 2015; yet another reminder to investors that volatility and uncertainty are mainstays in the inherently low-margin paper industry. </P><P>In all fairness, while selling corrugated packaging and specialty paper products isn't that exciting, International Paper has done its best to combat headwinds and return value to shareholders, as evidenced by a 3.5% dividend yield and consistently strong operating cash flow. With the stock now within hollering distance of all-time highs, is there any growth left in 2017?</P><DIV class=""image""><P class=""caption"">Image source: Getty Images.</P></DIV><H2>Looking in the rear-view mirror</H2><P>Last year presented several challenges. All four operating segments -- industrial packaging, global cellulose fibers, printing papers, and consumer packaging -- exited 2016 posting operating profits below those set in the final quarter of 2015. The reason was simple: lower average selling prices and higher costs of products sold. </P><P>Consider these highlighted financial metrics from the full-year 2016 compared to the previous year: </P><DIV dir=""ltr""><DIV class=""table-responsive""><TABLE><THEAD><TR><TH><P>Metric</P></TH></TR></THEAD><TBODY><TR><TD><P>Operating profit, global cellulose fibers</P></TD><TD><P>($180 million)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>(1.8%)</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></DIV><P class=""caption"">Data source: International Paper. YOY = year over year.</P><P>How do the results in the table above justify a 47% increase in stock price? They don't. But analysts and investors were encouraged by progress toward long-term goals and steady cash flow from operations, rather than worried about changes in near-term operations.</P><P>Cash flow from operations came in at $2.48 billion last year. While that's slightly below the $2.58 billion and $3.08 billion from the previous two years, respectively, International Paper had a net cash burn of just $17 million in 2016. The pulp and paper leader would have actually generated cash if it didn't increase the dividend by 7%, but the net difference isn't significant for a $20 billion company. Furthermore, much of the dividend increase was offset by a reduction in annual interest expense after refinancing debt.  </P><P>Investors are betting that strategic moves completed in 2015 and 2016 -- such as selling unprofitable businesses, swallowing up asset impairment charges, and purchasing <STRONG>Weyerhaeuser</STRONG>'s pulp operations for $2.2 billion -- will prove beneficial in the long run. Indeed, chairman and CEO Mark Sutton provided encouragement to shareholders on a conference call earlier this month:   </P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>While we experienced margin pressure in 2016, we enter the new year with an improving economic <mark>climate</mark> and several catalysts which we expect to improve profitability across International Paper. We are focused on serving our customers, strong operations and margin improvement, along with integrating the newly acquired pulp business and driving synergies. We remain confident in our ability to create shareholder value through thoughtful capital allocation with a near-term focus on debt reduction.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>All of this begs the question: Can International Paper stock continue its incredible run this year?</P><H2>Looking ahead</H2><P>In addition to maximizing margins, which is out of the company's control to some extent, the most significant event of 2017 will be the integration of Weyerhaeuser's pulp business. The $2.2 billion transaction -- which drops to $1.9 billion when tax benefits are included -- saw International Paper take control of five pulp mills, two converting facilities, and a healthy portfolio of intellectual property and research and development facilities.  </P><P>Here's the exciting part related to near-term value creation: Four of the five pulp mills reside in the American Southeast, which doubles International Paper's footprint in the region. That's not particularly riveting, but hear me out. The acquisition positions the company to take advantage of fluff pulp and softwood pulp inherent to the region. Both types of pulp are well-suited for consumer applications -- diapers, personal hygiene, tissue products -- that are higher-margin and generally considered recession-proof. Moreover, the pulp mills will be able to sell directly to consumer paper product mills in the Southeast, which is home to some of the industry's newest infrastructure in the United States.  </P><P>After spending $85 million to integrate the assets and 1,900 employees, International Paper expects to realize annual synergies of $175 million by 2018 and achieve returns greater than its cost of capital. Enabling the production of diapers and hygiene products may sound like a boring business to be in, but dividend-loving investors shouldn't overlook the acquisition's short- and long-term significance. </P><P>Indeed, analysts expect the company's profitability to rise. International Paper stock trades at less than 14 times future earnings estimates -- a steep discount compared to a trailing earnings ratio of 23. Optimism among analysts certainly played a significant role in pushing the stock higher in 2016, which could hint that shares aren't done rising yet. </P><P class=""caption""><A href=""http://ycharts.com/companies/IP/pe_ratio"" target=""_blank"">IP PE Ratio (TTM)</A> data by <A href=""http://ycharts.com"" target=""_blank"">YCharts</A>.</P><H2>What does it mean for investors?</H2><P>Recent strategic moves by management, including asset sales and the major acquisition of Weyerhaeuser's pulp business, should encourage investors that International Paper is well-positioned to continue returning value to shareholders. Will the stock continue forging ahead in 2017? Well, 2016 will be a difficult act to follow. While I don't think investors should necessarily expect an encore performance, especially considering the pulp and paper industry is accompanied by low margins, I do think the stock will continue rising in the long term.</P></SPAN><SPAN class=""article-disclosure""><P><EM><A href=""http://my.fool.com/profile/TMFBlacknGold/info.aspx"">Maxx Chatsko</A> has no position in any stocks mentioned.

But new reports suggest an even more complex legacy—that Raymond, while he was leading the charge to undermine near-consensus <mark>climate</mark> science, had access to pioneering, Exxon-produced studies that meticulously documented the potential perils of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Beginning in 1977, Exxon scientists began to produce a decade of papers that described a general scientific consensus that the burning of fossil fuels was changing global <mark>climate</mark>. It was not yet knowable whether the planet was undergoing a heating trend, but if it was, temperatures could rise by three to 10 degrees Celsius, <A href=""http://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/15092015/Exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming"">one early paper</A> said. In the late 1980s, however, Exxon abruptly embraced a message that scientists were exaggerating how much they knew, and that the risk was that they were utterly wrong. In full-throated public statements, Raymond himself said he did not believe the planet was warming.</P><P>The possible legal ramifications of the Exxon paper trail are that the company could potentially be shown in a court to have deliberately squelched scientifically based evidence that effectively accepted the consensus view. Science is rarely incontrovertible, but, as the <A href=""http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2014/08/20/tobacco-fines-dwarf-bank-payouts-for-shoddy-mortgage-lending/"">tobacco industry was fined</A> a decade ago for having lied about the dangers of cigarettes, Exxon could be liable for stiff penalties should it be shown to have purposely misled the public for corporate gain.</P><P>This presents Exxon with a tougher task than merely distancing itself from Raymond’s most extreme policies: It includes simultaneously discrediting the new reports of its <mark>climate</mark>-change knowledge, both stomping on and embracing Raymond’s history, and meanwhile burnishing its <mark>climate</mark>-change credentials.</P><FIGURE id=""image-532239"" class=""progressive-image inline-image  alignright zoomable size-small""><FIGCAPTION class=""inline-image-caption"">Current CEO Rex Tillerson<SPAN class=""inline-image-credit has-space""> (AP/Michael Probst)</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>If it looks like a mess, if not a corporate crisis, ExxonMobil appears to think it is, too, judging by how it is responding.</P><P>The reason seems simple: The reports—produced in recent weeks by <A href=""http://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/content/Exxon-The-Road-Not-Taken"">Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News</A>, a Pulitzer Prize-winning, digital newsletter, and by a <A href=""http://graphics.latimes.com/exxon-arctic/"">combined team</A> from the Columbia University Journalism School and the Los Angeles Times—are attracting uncomfortable national attention.</P><P>Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley <A href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-exxon-investigation_5626a0cce4b08589ef496854"">have separately urged a US government probe</A> to investigate if ExxonMobil deliberately concealed internal conclusions that <mark>climate change</mark> could cause cataclysmic global damage.</P><P>A former prosecutor in the successful 2006 US racketeering case against tobacco companies has <A href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/10/20/1436078/-Former-DOJ-atty-who-beat-Big-Tobacco-wants-probe-of-Exxon-and-others-who-buried-<mark>climate</mark>-change-info"">asserted that similar charges</A> might be warranted against ExxonMobil.</P><P><SPAN class=""pull-quote""><SPAN class=""quote-line""> </SPAN><SPAN>The allegations suggest a self-interested coverup involving global warming</SPAN><SPAN class=""quote-line""> </SPAN></SPAN>The fierce political reaction isn’t surprising, given the heated presidential race. Neither is ExxonMobil’s <A href=""http://news.exxonmobil.com/press-release/exxonmobil-says-<mark>climate</mark>-research-stories-inaccurate-and-deliberately-misleading"">ferocious defense</A>: at least since the 1969 <A href=""http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/~jeff/sb_69oilspill/69oilspill_articles2.html"">Santa Barbara oil spill</A> by Unocal, a considerable segment of the American public has reserved outsized suspicion for Big Oil. In this case, polls show that a majority of Americans would like to see global warming addressed (<A href=""http://polling.clearpath.org/docs/clearpath_survey_report.pdf"">pdf slides 21 and 25</A>).</P><P>There is no use speculating as to the probability or not of actual charges, but ExxonMobil, judging by its response to date, wishes to head off this potential risk (and if so, its strategy aligns with a corporate trend of using the <A href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/1762f650-78ad-11e5-933d-efcdc3c11c89.html#axzz3pM9WjpaD"">same social media-tools</A> that are shaking up conventional media, the FT writes.).</P><P>Company spokesman Alan Jeffers dismissed the Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News report as biased work.</P><P>“Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News is funded by anti-oil and gas foundations and activists and based on the inaccurate and biased reporting we’ve seen can be considered anti-oil and gas activists,” Jeffers said in <A href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2487075-jeffers-statement.html"">an e-mail responding</A> to a query from Quartz. “I would challenge to you find a single story on their site that you’d consider a fair and balanced treatment of the industry, the benefits it provides to society and its importance to modern life.”</P><P>“Exxon in essence denies that it ever tried to deny <mark>climate change</mark>, though there is a large record of its efforts,” Neela Banerjee, lead reporter for the Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News series, told Quartz. “We asked many detailed questions of Exxon and the company went silent in our private communications pretty early. Instead, it has resorted to name-calling in public.”</P><H2>Raymond simply did not believe the <mark>climate</mark> science</H2><P>Raymond was a Ph.D chemist who was equally respected and reviled on Wall Street—he was widely regarded as the sharpest business mind in Big Oil, and also one of its least-tolerant, politically incorrect executives. If you displeased him, watch out.</P><FIGURE id=""image-532149"" class=""progressive-image inline-image  alignleft zoomable size-small""><FIGCAPTION class=""inline-image-caption"">Raymond, 1999.<SPAN class=""inline-image-credit has-space""> (AP/Richard Drew)</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>This portrait spills out on the pages of <EM>Private Empire</EM>, a history of ExxonMobil published in 2012 by Steve Coll, a double-Pulitzer Prize-winning staff writer at The New Yorker, and now the dean of the Columbia University School of Journalism. Coll sums up Raymond this way: “He delivered profits; he ignored criticism.”</P><P>One subject that particularly riled Raymond was the evolving science of <mark>climate change</mark>—he simply did not believe the increasing number of forecasts of a heating planet, less a human role in any such ongoing phenomenon. The most <A href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/exxon-chairman-calls-poverty-most-pressing-environmental-problem-in-developing-countries-77530627.html"">pressing environmental problem</A> on the planet is “poverty, not global <mark>climate change</mark>,” he said in 1997.</P><P>But he went further than mere skepticism. Numerous reports detail Raymond’s expenditure of millions of corporate dollars on a campaign, sometimes surruptitiously through front groups, to discredit <mark>climate</mark> researchers, including <A href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/global_warming/exxon_report.pdf"">this 2007 study</A> by the Union of Concerned Scientists.</P><P>With the campaign, Coll wrote, the company “self-consciously invested in the dissemination of doubt about <mark>climate change</mark>,” in a pattern that “crossed into disinformation.” (In response, company spokesman Jeffers told Quartz: “We reject long-discredited conspiracy theories that labeled legitimate scientific observations as <mark>climate</mark> denial.”)</P><P>In 2005, Raymond retired, and Exxon’s board chose as his successor Rex Tillerson—a polished, <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/30/business/worldbusiness/30iht-exxon.html?pagewanted=all"">much less grouchy</A> CEO, who remains in the post today. Tillerson especially quieted down the company’s anti-<mark>climate change</mark> rhetoric. While at first that did not mean an actual change in policy, since 2009—with the election of president Barack Obama—Tillerson <A href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123146091530566335"">has advocated action</A> (paywall) on <mark>climate change</mark> through the imposition of a <mark>carbon</mark> tax.</P><H2>What Exxon knew and when it knew it</H2><P>Raymond’s attitude and his politics—while repulsive to his critics, especially since much of it was stealthy guerrilla warfare conducted from behind a curtain—did not appear to cross any legal boundaries.</P><P>Proof that tobacco companies knew cigarettes were unhealthy, yet financed studies and gave testimony saying the opposite, was the smoking gun that doomed the industry. But Exxon under Raymond had not previously been seen to have “maliciously distorted in-house scientific research,” Coll wrote.</P><P>But now, the news reports, relying on previously little-known papers and documents, many of them housed in an ExxonMobil archive at the University of Texas, allege that the company knew much more than it owned up to.</P><P>As far as mainstream outside researchers knew, there had been no ExxonMobil examination of <mark>climate change</mark> prior to Raymond himself initiating it. But in an eight-month investigation, Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News reporters studied a trove of serious internal Exxon studies of <mark>climate change</mark> <A href=""http://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/16092015/exxon-believed-deep-dive-into-<mark>climate</mark>-research-would-protect-its-business"">going back as early as 1977</A>, long before the subject had surfaced in national public or political discourse. There is no immediately apparent record of anyone previously examining the studies, which are archived at the university’s Briscoe Center for American History.</P><P><A href=""http://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/15092015/Exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming"">The lead piece</A> in the website’s <mark>climate</mark> series describes a senior Exxon scientist named James F. Black standing before the company’s all-powerful Management Committee, a small group that, going back to John D. Rockefeller in the late 19th century, decided all corporate matters. To gain admission to the Management Committee was no easy matter.</P><P><SPAN class=""pull-quote""><SPAN class=""quote-line""> </SPAN><SPAN>Exxon’s <mark>climate</mark> scientists were proud of themselves–in their view they were on par with Bell Laboratories in terms of being on the cutting edge of an important subject.</SPAN><SPAN class=""quote-line""> </SPAN></SPAN>“There is general scientific agreement that the most likely manner in which mankind is influencing the global <mark>climate</mark> is through <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide release from the burning of fossil fuels,” Black told Exxon’s most senior executives. He went on to say, “some countries would benefit but others would have their agricultural output reduced or destroyed.”</P><P>The series documents the subsequent decade-long corporate study of the impact of fossil fuels on the <mark>climate</mark>, relying on interviews with those involved, in addition to <A href=""http://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/search_documents?field_related_project=41124"">papers from the archive</A>. The Exxon scientists conducting the studies were proud of their work—they judged themselves on par with Bell Laboratories as private researchers on the cutting edge of an important scientific subject.</P><P>That’s also the way it was seen by US government officials privy to the work. One, from the Department of Energy, wrote to Exxon in 1979, “We are very pleased with Exxon’s research intentions related to the CO<SUB>2</SUB> question. This represents very responsible action, which we hope will serve as a model for research contributions from the corporate sector. This is truly a national and international service.”</P><P>Along the way, a consensus developed that the ramifications of <mark>climate change</mark> were perilous. As far as a response, one option was to keep measuring to see whether warming was really happening. The only trouble with that course, one scientist said, was that by the time you had incontrovertible evidence, it might be too late to do anything.</P><P>In 1990, according to a piece <A href=""http://graphics.latimes.com/exxon-research/"">published Oct. 23</A> in the LA Times, Exxon made a choice—in terms of its public policy, it would ignore the nuances of the <mark>climate</mark> science and emphasize the uncertainties.</P><P>Exxon’s manager of science and strategy development told fellow executives that acting against <mark>climate change</mark> would entail curtailing the use of fossil fuels, or draconian regulation of emissions, that would would “alter profoundly the strategic direction of the energy industry.” The impact on Exxon itself “will come sooner … than from <mark>climate change</mark> itself,” he said. The best course to avoid damaging the company’s prospects was to urge more study of the science, and emphasize how much <mark>climate</mark> action would cost the economy.</P><P>Thus Exxon policy on <mark>climate change</mark> was set in motion, with a philosophy that runs through its pronouncements on the subject to this day.</P><H2>Does this mean the Management Committee really <EM>knew</EM>?</H2><P>ExxonMobil has responded to all this reporting in a fury. Company vice president Ken Cohen, who ran Raymond’s anti-<mark>climate change</mark> campaign in the 1990s, is front and center in a powerful salvo against both publications. An <A href=""http://news.exxonmobil.com/press-release/exxonmobil-says-<mark>climate</mark>-research-stories-inaccurate-and-deliberately-misleading"">Oct. 21 company statement</A> carries this headline: “ExxonMobil says <mark>Climate</mark> Research Stories Inaccurate and Deliberately Misleading.” Cohen is quoted:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Activists deliberately cherry-picked statements attributed to various company employees to wrongly suggest definitive conclusions were reached decades ago by company researchers. These activists took those statements out of context and ignored other readily available statements demonstrating that our researchers recognized the developing nature of <mark>climate</mark> science at the time which, in fact, mirrored global understanding.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Though Cohen does not say so in his statements, ExxonMobil, under Tillerson, is far more embracing of the mainstream science. In a <A href=""http://www.exxonmobilperspectives.com/2015/05/06/exxonmobil-paris-and-<mark>carbon</mark>-policy/"">May blog post</A> on the company website, Cohen himself wrote that “the risks of <mark>climate change</mark> are real and the risks warrant action.”</P><P>But critics say the company remains conflicted. Greenpeace and the Union of Concerned Scientists say ExxonMobil continues to spend <A href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/07/ExxonMobil-<mark>Climate</mark>-Denial-Funding-1998-2014.pdf"">tens of thousands of dollars a year</A> (pdf) to fund lobbying and research that challenge the science of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Asked for examples of cherry-picking and statements taken out of context, spokesman Jeffers <A href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2487075-jeffers-statement.html"">responded at length</A>. On material taken out of context, he referenced another <A href=""http://www.exxonmobilperspectives.com/2015/10/21/when-it-comes-to-<mark>climate</mark>-change-read-the-documents/"">blog post</A> by Cohen, who asked his readers to read the <A href=""http://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/search_documents?field_related_project=41124"">list of Exxon documents</A> posted at the Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News website, in order to understand that they “completely undercut the allegations made by Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News.”</P><P>Both Cohen’s and Jeffers’ statements call Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News an anti-oil and gas activist organization. Asked whether the company regards the reporters themselves as activists, Jeffers replied that yes he does (the complete quote is at the top of this story and in the <A href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2487075-jeffers-statement.html"">pdf of his response</A>).</P><P>Two of the project’s three reporters—Lisa Song and David Hasemyer—shared the Pulitzer Prize for national reporting in 2013 for a series at Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News, and Banerjee, the lead reporter, was formerly a foreign correspondent for the Wall Street Journal and later a US-based reporter for the New York Times.</P><P>The Columbia-LAT team declined to comment. Banerjee sent <A href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2487076-neela.html"">a lengthy statement</A>. In part, she said,</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>We never said Exxon stopped its research, nor suppressed the results. We did, however, raise questions about why Exxon began pulling away from mainstream <mark>climate</mark> science starting in the late 1980s. It worked instead to stall action on emissions reductions, a campaign we documented in detail in the story that ran <SPAN class=""aBn""><SPAN class=""aQJ"">Thursday</SPAN></SPAN>. Inside<mark>Climate</mark> never got a satisfactory answer from Exxon about the pivot from science to stalling.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>In addition to the pair of Democratic presidential candidates, two California congressmen—Ted Lieu and Mark DeSaulnier—<A href=""http://www.chem.info/news/2015/10/lawmakers-accuses-exxonmobil-downplaying-<mark>climate</mark>-data"">have called for</A> an investigation by the US Justice Department. Yet prosecutors could decide that in fact no crime occurred—that Raymond’s Exxon did choose to embrace the uncertainty of <mark>climate change</mark> rather than the potential peril, but that, while perhaps short-sighted, the decision does not rise to the malfeasance of the tobacco industry. Raymond was disagreeable, but so what?</P><P>But there is something to the subtext of Banerjee’s question: Why, given the early uncertainty, did Raymond with such absolute confidence scorn and dismiss those raising the alarm, including the evidential points raised by his own scientists? When the potential stakes were so high, why did he manufacture the industry of doubt that continues to weigh down a resolution of the <mark>climate</mark> issue?</P><P>Turned around, at an inflection point, ExxonMobil pivoted away from attacking <mark>climate change</mark> to attacking <mark>climate</mark> science. In doing so, it took extremely certain action, anchored by uncertain evidence.</P><DIV class=""article-aside""><ASIDE class=""popular-stories-module""><ARTICLE><H4 class=""module-title"">Most Popular</H4></ARTICLE></ASIDE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The war in the Pacific was guided by War Plan Orange, a secret strategy the U.S. military had been developing, refining, and updating since 1906. </P></DIV><DIV class=""full-article"" id=""togg""><DIV class=""article-body""><P> Evolving through many iterations, War Plan Orange described the major phases anticipated in a war in the Pacific. The plan identified required capabilities, informed force structure planning, and justified budget submissions. In general, the war played out as expected, and War Plan Orange proved a blueprint for victory. </P><P> Planning for the long-term implications of <mark>climate change</mark> today is as important as planning for a major Pacific conflict was in the last century. To address <mark>climate change</mark>, the Department of Defense (DoD) and Pacific Command (PaCom) in particular need a 21st-century War Plan Orange. </P><H4> <mark>Climate Change</mark> and Conflict </H4><P> A rapidly growing body of research links <mark>climate change</mark> to unrest and conflict around the world. While <mark>climate change</mark> is rarely seen as the only cause, it is frequently considered a “threat multiplier” that exacerbates preexisting issues and contributes to both intra- and interstate conflict. Its far-reaching effects are summarized in the “2014 DoD <mark>Climate Change</mark> Adaptation Roadmap”: </P><P> Rising global temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, climbing sea levels, and more extreme weather events will intensify the challenges of global instability, hunger, poverty, and conflict. They will likely lead to food and water shortages, pandemic disease, disputes over refugees and resources, and destruction by natural disasters in regions across the globe. </P><P> Some of the most profound effects will be felt in the Asia-Pacific. In 2013, then-PaCom Commander Admiral Samuel Locklear identified <mark>climate change</mark> as the biggest long-term security threat in his area of responsibility. He explained that the associated upheaval “is probably the most likely thing that is going to happen . . . that will cripple the security environment, probably more likely than the other scenarios we all often talk about.”<A href=""#footnotes""><SUP> 1 </SUP></A></P><H4> Rising Temperatures, Rising Threats </H4><P> The planet is warming. According to the World Meteorological Organization, 16 of the 17 hottest years on record have occurred since 2000. <A href=""#footnotes""><SUP> 2 </SUP></A>  Increasing temperatures affect human health through heat stress, decreased agricultural yields, and expanded geographic ranges of disease vectors (rodents and insects). <A href=""#footnotes""><SUP> 3  </SUP></A> Rising temperatures also will take an economic toll on the Asia-Pacific. By 2030, India and China could see annual gross domestic product losses totaling $450 billion resulting from the impact of summertime heat on human work capacity. <A href=""#footnotes""><SUP> 4  </SUP></A> The heat also will increase the demand for cooling and air conditioning, challenging fragile, overworked power grids and stressing energy supplies. <A href=""#footnotes""><SUP> 5 </SUP></A></P><P> In 2016, the National Academy of Sciences released a report titled “Attribution of Extreme Weather Events in the Context of <mark>Climate Change</mark>,” which not only linked episodes of extreme temperature to <mark>climate change</mark>, but also extremes in precipitation. Precipitation patterns likely will continue to change temporally and spatially, with more pronounced and longer-lasting droughts in some locations and more intense highly localized precipitation in other areas, leading to significant flooding. <A href=""#footnotes""><SUP> 6 </SUP></A>  Besides threatening life and property, these events threaten agriculture and food security. <A href=""#footnotes""><SUP> 7 </SUP></A></P><P> <mark>Climate change</mark> also drives slower-acting threats like sea level rise. <A href=""#footnotes""><SUP> 8  </SUP></A> Melting polar ice sheets, thermal expansion of seawater, and other dynamic changes will increase water levels around the world, inundating low-lying coastal areas. <A href=""#footnotes""><SUP> 9 </SUP></A>  Even if these areas remain above the high-water line, they will be more susceptible to abnormally high tides and storm surges. Across the Asia-Pacific, populations are shifting from rural to urban areas, many of which lie along the water. As of 2014, almost 48 percent of the Asia-Pacific population was living in cities (compared to 26 percent in 1970), and many of the poorest settle in the most vulnerable areas like flood plains, raising the potential for acute humanitarian crises. <A href=""#footnotes""><SUP> 10 </SUP></A></P><P> In addition, there are less obvious effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, such as retreating glaciers, which decrease the availability of freshwater downstream. Follow-on effects include reduced water to irrigate agriculture and decreased river flow at dams for hydroelectric power generation. <A href=""#footnotes""><SUP> 11 </SUP></A>  Offshore, rising temperatures bleach coral reefs (coral mortality has reached 50 percent in northern parts of the Great Barrier Reef) and oceanic uptake of <mark>CO2</mark> is making the seawater more acidic, affecting the fisheries many nations rely on for food and livelihoods. <A href=""#footnotes""><SUP> 12 </SUP></A></P><P> PaCom already faces the full range of natural disasters in the Asia-Pacific. Between 1970 and 2014, natural disasters accounted for more than 2 million deaths in the Asia-Pacific, 57 percent of the global total. <A href=""#footnotes""><SUP> 13 </SUP></A>  Admiral Locklear routinely told his subordinate commanders, “While you’re here you may not have a conflict with another military, but you will have a natural disaster that you have to either assist in or be prepared to manage the consequences on the other side.” The vastness of PaCom’s area of responsibility coupled with the increased frequency of natural disasters may spread thin PaCom’s forces as they execute humanitarian assistance/disaster relief (HADR) operations. These response operations are critical, as the emergent needs of domestic populations and/or migration of displaced persons can stress fragile governments beyond their ability to cope. This breakdown of the social contract sets conditions that lead to instability, which can quickly spread across national boundaries and lead to wider conflict. PaCom has a vested interest in maintaining stability: five of the seven U.S. collective defense treaties apply to nations in the region. </P><P> These <mark>climate change</mark> effects are not part of a distant future; they are happening now. Current PaCom issues include: </P><P>• Displaced people. In 2015 (the latest year with complete data), 19.2 million people were displaced by weather, water, <mark>climate</mark>, and geophysical hazards in 113 countries, more than twice as many as for conflict and violence. The majority were in South and East Asia. <A href=""#footnotes""><SUP> 14 </SUP></A></P><P>• Water rights. Water rights associated with the rivers fed by shrinking Himalayan glaciers are coming into question as China dams the upper Mekong, which feeds Cambodia and Vietnam downstream. <A href=""#footnotes""><SUP> 15 </SUP></A></P><P>• Water access. In September 2016, India threatened to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty over violence in Kashmir. If India suspends the treaty, which specifies how India and Pakistan (both nuclear powers) manage the Indus River Basin’s rivers and tributaries, it will cut off the flow to Pakistan and deny entire provinces already stressed by prolonged drought their sole water source. <A href=""#footnotes""><SUP> 16 </SUP></A></P><P>• Food security. Warming western Pacific waters are driving vital fish stocks northward. In the South China Sea, this is bringing Vietnamese fishermen into Chinese-claimed waters. <A href=""#footnotes""><SUP> 17 </SUP></A>  In the Yellow Sea, this is bringing Chinese fishermen into contact with South Koreans, resulting in the October 2016 ramming and sinking of a South Korean Coast Guard boat by a 100-ton Chinese fishing vessel. <A href=""#footnotes""><SUP> 18 </SUP></A></P><P>• Mass migration. From the Maldives in the Indian Ocean to Vanuatu in the Pacific, island nations are being threatened and populations are beginning to be displaced by rising sea levels. <A href=""#footnotes""><SUP> 19 </SUP></A></P><P> While PaCom cannot address the root causes of <mark>climate change</mark>, it can posture itself to actively mitigate its effects and assist partners. There is sufficient guidance already in force to do so. </P><H4> Opportunities for Power Projection </H4><P> While <mark>climate change</mark> is divisive in U.S. politics, it is a unifying international theme. By stressing local governments beyond their capability and/or capacity to respond, it provides a new opportunity for PaCom’s international engagement and assistance. This will give PaCom access, which over time can become influence. </P><P> Even with a “whole of government” approach led by the U.S. Agency for International Development, the face of operations likely will be PaCom forces. Only the military has the logistics, manpower, command and control, and overall organization to execute major operations. This military visibility provides a messaging opportunity that can boost PaCom’s image as the trusted partner of choice, while at the same time provide presence and increase stability during times of crisis. </P><P> <mark>Climate change</mark> also is a challenge against which the United States can partner with other nations where it is in search of common ground, like China. Opportunities for engagement and cooperation open dialog and build relationships and understanding that can help avoid future miscalculation. </P><P> PaCom should seize this opportunity for power projection. Per the “2015 Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower,” HADR is power projection, and hospital ships like the USNS Comfort (T-AH-20) and Mercy (T-AH-19) executing medical aid missions can have as large an effect as kinetic operations. China has taken note and launched the Peace Ark with similar tasking. If PaCom does not respond to <mark>climate</mark>-related challenges in the Pacific, China will fill the vacuum, gaining prestige and influence at U.S. expense. </P><H4> A <mark>Climate Change</mark> War Plan </H4><P> PaCom should consider the following responses to prepare for <mark>climate change</mark> effects: </P><P>• Build flexible partnerships, agreements, and contingency plans to deal with the spectrum of <mark>climate</mark>-related disasters. This will avoid delays in responding to events, particularly in the early stages when critical infrastructure and communications may be unavailable. By preparing in advance, PaCom can establish regional logistics hubs, preposition supplies, create and rehearse rapid distribution plans, and reach agreements regarding the logistics of refugee movement and sustainment. </P><P>• Build partner resilience to the longer-term, slower-acting effects of <mark>climate change</mark>. PaCom should assist partner nations in building their capacity for “self-help” and mutual assistance. PaCom experts can work with partner nations to identify critical infrastructure at risk to sea level rise. Expanded assistance could include assisting partners in developing strategies to mitigate these vulnerabilities or even assisting in the construction of levees, breakwaters, or relocation to higher ground. </P><P>• Expand collective HADR expertise. The best way to prepare for HADR, as a unilateral force or as part of a coalition, is to train. Existing PaCom exercises like Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) and Cooperative Afloat Readiness Training are venues where HADR missions can be rehearsed. This will confirm interoperability of communications protocols, tactics, techniques, and procedures before the crisis. PaCom should seek inclusion of smaller nations, even those with modest capabilities. These overtures may increase U.S. access and these nations’ receptiveness to hosting temporary basing or logistics hubs in support of future military operations. </P><P>• Focus on the “enablers.” PaCom should advocate for investments that target HADR capability gaps. This should extend to nontraditional logistics and distribution capabilities. Recognizing the worldwide shortfall of amphibious combatants, PaCom should advocate for capabilities such as the expeditionary fast transport or expeditionary transfer dock that can deliver aid without tying up traditional amphibious ships, which are needed to meet global force management requirements elsewhere. <A href=""#footnotes""><SUP> 20 </SUP></A>  Likewise, PaCom should pursue enhanced environmental monitoring and prediction capabilities, to include long-range seasonal forecasting capabilities to identify hazardous environmental conditions in advance, giving longer lead times to stage equipment and forces for prompt response. </P><P>• Develop new concepts of operations (ConOps). Through iterative war gaming and experimentation, PaCom should develop ConOps to respond to the range of <mark>climate</mark> threats, including evaluating vulnerability and mitigating risk to PaCom bases, installations, supply chains, and training ranges. Responses should be customized, necessitating the creation, deployment, and employment of adaptive force packages (AFPs—tailored detachments made up of specific capabilities). AFPs ensure appropriate resources for the situation and allow husbanding of other capabilities for deployment elsewhere. <A href=""#footnotes""><SUP> 21 </SUP></A></P><H4> An Opportunity </H4><P> <mark>Climate change</mark> effects will play an ever-increasing role in shaping the security environment. On 7 September 2016, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper offered his assessment at the Intelligence and National Security Summit: </P><P> In the coming decades, an underlying meta-driver of unpredictable instability will be, I believe, <mark>climate change</mark>. Major population centers will compete for ever-diminishing food and water resources and governments will have an increasingly difficult time controlling their territories. </P><P> Neither DoD nor PaCom can negotiate with, deter, or preemptively attack a changing environment. They can, however, anticipate changes, posture forces, and develop capabilities to mitigate threats and seize emerging opportunities. War Plan Orange was successful because it bounded the problem and provided focus to prepare for war with Japan. Likewise, DoD and PaCom need a coherent and comprehensive planning effort both to prepare for the upheaval caused by <mark>climate change</mark> and to seek competitive advantages the situation may present.

He holds a PhD in physical oceanography and has served with the CNO Strategic Studies Group, CNO Strategic Actions Group, and Task Force <mark>Climate Change</mark>. </DIV><DIV class=""bio""> </DIV><H4> </H4><H4> The Political Cimate </H4><P> The federal government has no shortage of security assessments and high-level guidance that acknowledge <mark>climate change</mark> threats, including the “2014 Quadrennial Defense Review,”“2015 National Security Strategy,” and the Director of National Intelligence’s “2016 Worldwide Threat Assessment.” The 2015 defense appropriations bill contained a request that the Department of Defense (DoD) identify the most serious and likely <mark>climate</mark>-related security risks for each combatant command and how mitigation of these risks was integrated into planning processes. In 2016, DoD “mainstreamed” <mark>climate change</mark> with directive 4715.21, “<mark>Climate Change</mark> Adaptation and Resilience,” which required subordinate organizations to identify and assess the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> on the DoD mission, consider those effects when developing plans and implementing procedures, and anticipate and manage the associated risks. </P><P> Concern over <mark>climate change</mark> is not solely a U.S. military issue. For example, the United Kingdom’s “2015 National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence Security Review,” Australia’s “2016 Defence White Paper,” and NATO’s “Resolution 427 on <mark>Climate Change</mark> and International Security” all acknowledge <mark>climate change</mark>-related threats. With such widespread concern, <mark>climate change</mark> should be a dispassionate apolitical issue, but it has become emotionally charged and politicized. Varying degrees of buy-in and support across DoD and Congress have turned <mark>climate change</mark> planning efforts into a disjointed patchwork of taskers, data calls, and reports, lacking a comprehensive overall plan and framework for addressing the challenges. </P><P><STRONG> Pushback against Uncertainty </STRONG></P><P> Much of the pushback against <mark>climate change</mark> focuses on the uncertainty associated with future <mark>climate</mark> projections. However, most critics don’t understand that the major source of uncertainty is in how to quantify the effects of future human behavior, not that “the science isn’t settled.” How the world population will act (and emit the greenhouse gases driving <mark>climate change</mark>) is based on a complex interplay of individual beliefs, lifestyles, economic considerations, domestic policies, and international agreements. Future <mark>innovation</mark> in alternative energy sources may shift emissions onto a lower trajectory, while advances in the efficient extraction of traditional fossil fuels (like hydraulic fracking) may do the opposite. <mark>Climate</mark> models provide a range of outcomes to account for these future variations. In doing so, they provide a valuable window to the future. </P><P> Unfortunately, any uncertainty with <mark>climate</mark> models often is used as an excuse to completely discredit them as planning tools. This is a double standard when compared to DoD’s other long-range planning efforts. The Joint Staff’s 2016 planning document, “Joint Operational Environment (JOE) 2035,” states: </P><P> JOE 2035 does not predict the future or attempt to forecast specific scenarios or events. Instead, it develops a range of possibilities about future conflict by re-imagining the set of factors and circumstances shaping the future security environment. Thinking about the future through the lens of various trends, conditions, contexts, and implications encourages an expanded understanding of the scope of the problems facing the Joint Force as well as promising avenues to pursue solutions, and supports a broader appreciation of the implications of change that will confront the future Joint Force. </P><P> No military plan is executed with perfect foreknowledge. The uncertainty associated with <mark>climate change</mark> projections is well within the bounds for useful long-range planning. In fact, using just the primitive models available at the time, a 1983 National Academy of Sciences report described several expected <mark>climate change</mark> effects, including melting sea ice, thawing permafrost, rising sea levels, extreme temperatures, changing disease vectors, and a more accessible Arctic ocean with military implications, all of which have come to pass. <A href=""#footnotes""><SUP> 1 </SUP></A></P><P> 1.

Focusing on the largest gas, oil and coal producers and cement manufacturers, the study calculated the amount of sea level rise and global temperature increase resulting from the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and methane emissions from their products as well as their extraction and production processes.</P><P class=""paragraph"">The study quantified <mark>climate change</mark> impacts of each company’s <mark>carbon</mark> and methane emissions during two time periods: 1880 to 2010 and 1980 to 2010. By 1980, investor-owned fossil fuel companies were aware of the threat posed by their products and could have taken steps to reduce their risks and share them with their shareholders and the general public.</P><P class=""paragraph"">“We’ve known for a long time that fossil fuels are the largest contributor to <mark>climate change</mark>,” said Brenda Ekwurzel, lead author and director of <mark>climate</mark> science at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). “What’s new here is that we’ve verified just how much specific companies’ products have caused the Earth to warm and the seas to rise.”</P><P class=""paragraph"">The study builds on a landmark <A href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-013-0986-y"">2014 study</A> by Richard Heede of the <mark>Climate</mark> Accountability Institute, one of the co-authors of the study published today. Heede’s study, which also was published in <EM>Climatic Change</EM>, determined the amount of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and methane emissions that resulted from the burning of products sold by the 90 largest investor- and state-owned fossil fuel companies and cement manufacturers.</P><P class=""paragraph"">Ekwurzel and her co-authors inputted Heede’s 2014 data into a simple, well-established <mark>climate</mark> model that captures how the concentration of <mark>carbon</mark> emissions increases in the atmosphere, trapping heat and driving up global surface temperature and sea level. The model allowed Ekwurzel et al. to ascertain what happens when natural and human contributions to <mark>climate change</mark>, including those linked to the companies’ products, are included or excluded.</P><P class=""paragraph"">The study found that:</P><UL><LI>Emissions traced to the 90 largest <mark>carbon</mark> producers contributed approximately 57 percent of the observed rise in atmospheric <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, nearly 50 percent of the rise in global average temperature, and around 30 percent of global sea level rise since 1880.</LI><LI>Emissions linked to 50 investor-owned <mark>carbon</mark> producers, including BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Peabody, Shell and Total, were responsible for roughly 16 percent of the global average temperature increase from 1880 to 2010, and around 11 percent of the global sea level rise during the same time frame.</LI><LI>Emissions tied to the same 50 companies from 1980 to 2010, a time when fossil fuel companies were aware their products were causing global warming, contributed approximately 10 percent of the global average temperature increase and about 4 percent sea level rise.</LI><LI>Emissions traced to 31 majority state-owned companies, including Coal India, Gazprom, Kuwait Petroleum, Pemex, Petroleos de Venezuela, National Iranian Oil Company and Saudi Aramco, were responsible for about 15 percent of the global temperature increase and approximately 7 percent of the sea level rise between 1880 and 2010.</LI></UL><P class=""paragraph"">“Until a decade or two ago, no corporation could be held accountable for the consequences of their products’ emissions because we simply didn’t know enough about what their impacts were,” said Myles Allen, a study co-author and professor of geosystem science at the University of Oxford in England. “This study provides a framework for linking fossil fuel companies’ product-related emissions to a range of impacts, including increases in ocean acidification and deaths caused by heat waves, wildfires and other extreme weather-related events. We hope that the results of this study will inform policy and civil society debates over how best to hold major <mark>carbon</mark> producers accountable for their contributions to the problem.”</P><P class=""paragraph"">The question of who is responsible for <mark>climate change</mark> and who should pay for its related costs has taken on growing urgency as <mark>climate</mark> impacts worsen and become costlier. In New York City alone, officials <A href=""http://www.nyc.gov/html/sirr/html/report/report.shtml"">estimate</A> that it will cost more than $19 billion to adapt to <mark>climate change</mark>. Globally, adaptation cost projections are equally astronomical. The <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>analytics.org/latest/cost-of-adapting-to-<mark>climate</mark>-change-could-hit-500-billion-per-year-by-2050-report"">U.N. Environment Programme</A> estimates that developing countries will need $140 billion to $300 billion annually by 2030 and $280 billion to $500 billion annually by 2050 to adapt.</P><P class=""paragraph"">The debate over responsibility for <mark>climate</mark> mitigation and adaptation has long focused on the “common but differentiated responsibilities” of nations, a framework used for the Paris <mark>climate</mark> negotiations. Attention has increasingly turned to non-state actors, particularly the major fossil fuel producers.</P><P class=""paragraph"">“At the start of the Industrial Revolution, very few people understood that <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions progressively undermine the stability of the <mark>climate</mark> as they accumulate in the atmosphere, so there was nothing blameworthy about selling fossil fuels to those who wanted to buy them,” said Henry Shue, professor of politics and international relations at the University of Oxford and author of a <A href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-017-2042-9"">commentary</A> on the ethical implications of the Ekwurzel et al. paper that was published simultaneously in <EM>Climatic Change</EM>. “But circumstances have changed radically in light of evidence that a number of investor-owned companies have long understood the harm of their products, yet carried out a decades-long campaign to sow doubts about those harms in order to ensure fossil fuels would remain central to global energy production. Companies knowingly violated the most basic moral principle of ‘do no harm,’ and now they must remedy the harm they caused by paying damages and their proportion of adaptation costs.”</P><P class=""paragraph"">Had ExxonMobil, for example, acted on its own scientists’ research about the risks of its products, <mark>climate change</mark> likely would be far more manageable today.</P><P class=""paragraph"">“Fossil fuel companies could have taken any number of steps, such as investing in clean energy or <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage, but many chose instead to spend millions of dollars to try to deceive the public about <mark>climate</mark> science to block sensible limits on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions,” said Peter Frumhoff, a study co-author and director of science and policy at UCS. “Taxpayers, especially those living in vulnerable coastal communities, should not have to bear the high costs of these companies’ irresponsible decisions by themselves.”</P><P class=""paragraph"">Ekwurzel et al.’s study may inform approaches for juries and judges to calculate damages in such lawsuits as ones filed by two California counties and the city of Imperial Beach in July against 37 oil, gas and coal companies, claiming they should pay for damages from sea level rise. Likewise, the study should bolster investor campaigns to force fossil fuel companies to disclose their legal vulnerabilities and the risks that <mark>climate change</mark> poses to their finances and material assets.</P><P class=""paragraph""> </P><P><STRONG> </STRONG></P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></SECTION><DIV class=""region region-content-aside""><DIV class=""region-inner clearfix""><DIV id=""block-nodeblock-4683"" class=""block block-nodeblock no-title odd first last block-count-5 block-region-content-aside block-4683""><DIV class=""block-inner clearfix""><DIV class=""block-content content""><ARTICLE about=""/content-block/press-release-boilerplate-content-block"" typeof=""sioc:Item foaf:Document"" role=""article"" class=""ds-1col node node-content-block article even node-full view-mode-full  clearfix""><DIV class=""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-full""><DIV class=""field-items""><DIV class=""field-item even"" property=""content:encoded""><P><SPAN style=""color: #999999; font-size: small;"">The Union of Concerned Scientists puts rigorous, independent science to work to solve our planet's most pressing problems.

The so-called ‘diesel dupe’ made headlines around the globe in September when the EPA found defeat devices, designed to game the system and ensure that theirs were among the cleanest cars on the market, installed in VW vehicles.</P><P>The findings resulted in fines of epic proportions and, more pertinently, the exposure of one of the world’s foremost brands’ attempts to pedal a dishonest product under the guise of sustainability. The ugly saga has some way to go before the full truth of it is known. However, the fact of it up to this point is that over 11 million vehicles were fitted with the device, while millions of consumers – not to mention regulators – were misled about the group’s sustainability credentials.</P><P>Even with a new chief executive in tow, plus a revised and revved-up commitment to sustainability, disaffected consumers are eyeing Europe’s leading automaker with suspicion (<EM>see Fig. 1</EM>) – and deservedly so. “We need a culture of openness and cooperation”, the group’s Chairman of the Board of Management, Matthias Müller, said in a statement following the crisis. “We have to look beyond the current situation and create the conditions for Volkswagen’s successful further development.” However, there is a long way to go before it can hope to reclaim the consumer trust that was lost.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>In the cold, hard light of the emissions scandal, we’ve entered into a period where consumers would be wise to question corporate promises on <mark>climate change</mark></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>“VW, in pursuit of increased sales, showed flagrant disregard for environmental regulation and lost its customers’ trust”, Frances Way, Co-Chief Operating Officer at CDP (formerly the <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project), said in an interview with <EM>World Finance</EM>. “As the need for transparent disclosure on <mark>climate</mark> impacts has entered the mainstream, companies are more accountable to all their stakeholders.”</P><P>Today, having long ago declared itself a leading light on the hot button topic of <mark>climate change</mark>, Volkswagen has joined a long and growing list of companies to have promised and ultimately failed to uphold their sustainability pledges. And while companies are acknowledging the significance of <mark>climate change</mark> – more so by the day – the VW scandal is a reminder that these commitments are not always genuine.</P><P>In the cold, hard light of the emissions scandal, we’ve entered into a period where consumers would be wise to question corporate promises on <mark>climate change</mark>. The risks posed by rising emissions are well documented, though it seems that many companies are all too willing to set aside the risks in sight of immediate profits.</P><P><STRONG>The <mark>climate change</mark> question</STRONG>
For the most part, companies recognise that sustainability is not a choice, but a fact of the market. Nowhere else can this commitment be better seen than on the issue of <mark>climate change</mark>. “Companies understand first-hand the disruption that <mark>climate change</mark>, unabated, will cause to their supply chains, markets and operations”, said Kevin Moss, Global Director of WRI’s Business Centre, in an interview with <EM>European CEO</EM>.</P><P>Many businesses recognise that <mark>climate change</mark> could derail their operations, from the physical risks that could threaten their processes, to regulatory challenges that could impact their bottom line. On the flipside, according to Way, tackling <mark>climate change</mark> is a significant business opportunity: the low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy was valued at $5.5trn in 2011-12 and is growing at an over three percent clip every year.</P><P>This sentiment was echoed last year by a Ceres initiative, known as the Business for Innovative <mark>Climate</mark> and Energy Policy, or BICEP, when over 1,000 companies signed on to a “coordinated effort to combat <mark>climate change</mark>”. With Apple, Intel, GM, Nike, Unilever and hundreds of others on board, the <mark>climate</mark> declaration is proof enough that businesses are beginning to pay attention to the issues at hand.</P><P>Farid Baddache, Managing Director for Europe, Middle East and Africa at BSR, has stated that more and more companies are now focusing on <mark>climate change</mark>. The We Mean Business Coalition, of which BSR is a co-founder, already includes 329 companies and investors who have made more than 500 commitments to reduce their <mark>carbon</mark> footprints. The supporters so far include major European brands such as IKEA, BT Group, Commerzbank, H&amp;M, Unilever and Marks &amp; Spencer, and each has committed to procuring 100 percent of their electricity from renewable sources.</P><P>“After decades of debate, the scientific community is agreed on the science that shows that human activity is causing dangerous <mark>climate change</mark>”, said Way. “Just as importantly, this is now an established fact for leading businesses who understand that there is no greater threat to the global economy than <mark>climate change</mark>.”</P><P>Speaking about the role of business leaders in facilitating this transformation, Baddache told<EM> European CEO</EM>: “CEOs must state a vision enabling the transformational changes needed for their company to mitigate risks, capture opportunities and demonstrate leadership, creating value for the long-term.”</P><P>Where much of the emphasis in years gone by has fallen on governments, communities and the third sector in shouldering the costs, multinationals are being urged – increasingly so, in fact – to engage with the issue at hand.</P><FIGURE id=""attachment_35052"" style=""width: 300px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">Volkswagen’s new Chief Executive, Matthias Müller</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>“More and more companies are understanding that it is in their own business interest to take action to address <mark>climate change</mark>. CDP’s 2015 <mark>climate change</mark> report reveals that compared to 2010, when just under half of companies said they had activities in place to reduce emissions, now nine in 10 engage in these activities”, said Way. “We see that corporations are clearly shifting their strategies to become part of the solution to the <mark>climate</mark> challenge. The momentous and global nature of <mark>climate change</mark> means that, ultimately, we need everyone on board to take action.”</P><P><STRONG>Playing its part</STRONG>
According to a working paper authored jointly by the Centre for <mark>Climate Change</mark> Economics and Policy and the Grantham Research Institute on <mark>Climate Change</mark> and the Environment, “failure of adaptation measures” by business and governments ranked fifth among the global risks with the highest impact. “Yet, the role and impact of the private sector in delivering adaptation and, more generally, <mark>climate</mark>-resilient development, is poorly understood, perhaps with the exception of certain sectors – such as insurance, tourism, energy and utilities or the food and beverage sector – which have been more visible in terms of their response to <mark>climate</mark> risks.”</P><P>Internal factors, such as supply chain disruption and company culture, are the most important issues in driving private sector adaptation. External factors will play a much greater part in the near future, however, as extreme weather events, rising temperatures and rising sea levels enter into the mix. Regulatory changes, together with sustained stakeholder and shareholder pressure, will likewise have a bearing on private sector engagement, as companies look to incorporate <mark>climate change</mark> in their day-to-day decisions.</P><P>According to the latest GlobeScan/SustainAbility Survey, 86 percent of over 600 expert stakeholders representing business, governments, NGOs and academia feel that the private sector will play an ‘important’ or ‘very important’ role in advancing <mark>climate change</mark> solutions.</P><P>However, while a commitment to <mark>climate change</mark> is commendable, wavering from these commitments can breed mistrust among consumers, and doing so serves only to depress public opinion. A survey of 1,500 US citizens, conducted by the Pew Research Centre, shows that 43 percent of Americans view corporations unfavourably. This figure, up from 31 percent in 1985 (<EM>see Fig. 2</EM>), shows that scandals like the VW diesel dupe threaten to ratchet up the pressures facing corporations. Recognising that action on <mark>climate change</mark> brings with it valuable brand points and a much-needed competitive edge means that companies have been quick to get in on the act.</P><P><STRONG>The Exxon scandal</STRONG>
As if the situation for corporations wasn’t hard enough, it was made worse recently when the news emerged that ExxonMobil may have been knowingly misrepresenting the evidence for man-made <mark>climate change</mark>. New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has called for company documents that may prove that the world’s largest oil major has been knowingly downplaying the risks. If true, the oil major could face legal charges for failing to adequately inform investors about the risks to its bottom line.</P><P>To briefly cast an eye over the tenure of Exxon’s former CEO Lee Raymond, the company veteran of more than 40 years expressed doubts about whether the planet was warming at all. Not only were his views on the matter at odds with the scientific community at large; they conflicted with scientific studies commissioned by Exxon itself from 1977 onwards.</P><P>“In the first place, there is general scientific agreement that the most likely manner in which mankind is influencing the global <mark>climate</mark> is through <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide release from the burning of fossil fuels”, wrote James Black, a top expert in the company’s research and engineering division, in 1977. Expanding on his research the following year, Black warned Exxon’s managers that a doubling of <mark>CO2</mark> could increase average global temperatures by as much as three degrees Celsius, and as much as 10 degrees at the poles. “Present thinking”, he wrote, “holds that man has a time window of five to 10 years before the need for hard decisions regarding changes in energy strategies might become critical.” In order to prosecute, the state must find false statements concerning <mark>climate</mark>-related costs, and sources say that the investigation will likely extend to rival oil majors should the results prove fruitful. In short, the message to energy companies is that they can no longer afford to ignore the <mark>climate</mark> question, and, more than that, doing so risks legal repercussions.</P><P>Research conducted by Yale’s Dr Justin Farrell shows that the Exxon scandal is not the only case of a corporation influencing the public’s perception of <mark>climate change</mark>, with 20 years of data on the subject showing that there’s a relationship between corporate funding and <mark>climate change</mark> denial. In the study, Farrell went so far as to conclude that corporate funding actually influenced the specific content and language used by <mark>climate change</mark> sceptics.</P><P>Drawing on two sets of data – the first being a network of 4,556 individuals with ties to 164 <mark>climate</mark> sceptic organisations, and the second being 40,785 <mark>climate change</mark>-centred texts produced by those organisations in the period spanning 1993 to 2013 – Farrell said that “the text analysis is entirely computational, and it shows an ecosystem of influence”. He continued, writing in the online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences: “They were writing things that were different from the contrarian organisations that did not receive corporate funding… Over time, it brought them into a more cohesive social movement and aligned their messages.”</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Where many corporations are happy to make a pledge on the issue of <mark>climate change</mark>, few are willing to carry these promises through to fruition</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><STRONG>Painting it green</STRONG>
While there are signs that corporations are beginning to pay heed to the issue of <mark>climate change</mark>, cases much like VW, ExxonMobil and those discussed in Farrell’s analysis show that for every success, there is usually a failure. The fear is that the solution to <mark>climate change</mark> will not come voluntarily from companies, and so those who feel that it might may need to reduce their expectations. For years, corporate promises on <mark>climate change</mark> have been met with little in the way of scepticism, but this trust has been gradually eroded over time.</P><P>“Risks abound for companies who choose to be bystanders or to defend business-as-usual instead of proactively shaping the future of their industries”, said Moss. “They’ll find that the proactive and innovative competitors who look for market opportunities to serve the needs of society in a resource-constrained planet will be the ones to gain an advantage.” And while Moss’ opinion here is very much the general consensus, it has done little to deter companies from skirting their responsibilities.</P><P>“In our regular public opinion research on <mark>sustainable</mark> consumption across 18 countries with <EM>National Geographic</EM>, statistical modelling shows that greatest barriers to <mark>sustainable</mark> consumer behaviour were the lack of trust that consumers have in the claims companies make about the environmental performance of their products, and a lack of demonstrated sustainability leadership from both governments and companies (<EM>see Fig. 3</EM>)”, Stacy Rowland, Director of Public Relations and Communications at GlobeScan, told <EM>World Finance</EM>.</P><P>Ultimately, those misrepresenting the facts about <mark>climate change</mark> risk seriously damaging consumer trust. “While companies are seen as a big part of the problem, our research with both consumers and stakeholders consistently shows that they are expected to be a big part of the solution. Failing to deliver on this will only drive down trust, and it’s already at historically low levels”, said Rowland.</P><P>Those perpetuating green-based environmental initiatives while participating in nothing of the sort – a process more popularly known as ‘greenwashing’ – have polluted the <mark>climate</mark> question. Similar to whitewashing, where a company might make a coordinated attempt to obscure an otherwise unpleasant truth, greenwashing operates on the same principle, but in an environmental context.</P><P>The most often-cited example is a fossil fuel company that might profess to be green, though in reality this ‘greenness’ is only a very minor part of what is, in essence, a not-so-green business. Aside from ExxonMobil, Shell has been on the receiving end of greenwashing accusations perhaps more than any other energy company, and critics have taken pains to bring the company’s environmental commitments into focus.</P><P>The examples mentioned here, together with hundreds – if not thousands – of others, have complicated the question of whether corporations are doing enough to combat <mark>climate change</mark>. Well-intentioned statements often do little to rectify the real issues at hand, as where many corporations are happy to make a pledge on the issue of <mark>climate change</mark>, few are willing to carry these promises through to fruition. And while there is a growing consensus that meaningful action on <mark>climate change</mark> from the private sector won’t come without encouragement, there are a few exceptions where <mark>climate</mark> action takes priority.</P><P><STRONG>A brighter <mark>climate</mark></STRONG>
When the White House announced a commitment to the American Business Act on <mark>Climate Change</mark> in October, environmentalists rejoiced to see that some of the nation’s leading names had set their commitments to <mark>climate change</mark> out on paper. Apple, which runs the entirety of its US operations on renewable energy, pledged to bring an estimated 280mW of additional renewable capacity online before the end of 2016. Facebook, meanwhile, committed to 100 percent clean and renewable energy, and doubled its previous renewables target to 50 percent, by the year 2018.</P><P>Aiste Brackley, Research Manager at SustainAbility, said of these efforts in a recent GlobeScan press release: “The landscape of corporate leadership is dominated by technology and consumer companies that have been at the forefront of investing in renewable energy and low <mark>carbon</mark> solutions, and being vocal about their initiatives on the global stage.” While the commitments themselves are commendable, there were few in the group for whom the changes amounted to a cultural overhaul.</P><FIGURE id=""attachment_35076"" style=""width: 300px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">Members of the public form the slogan ‘100% renewable’ outside the COP21 proceedings in Paris</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>In terms of scope, surely no other initiative rivals Unilever’s <mark>Sustainable</mark> Living Plan. Seen in the latest GlobeScan/SustainAbility Survey as having made the greatest contribution to advancing <mark>climate change</mark> in the last five years, Unilever’s contributions stem from its origins as a purpose-driven company. According to the group, “Today our purpose is to make <mark>sustainable</mark> living commonplace”. The aim is to decouple growth from environmental impact, all while making a positive social difference, driving profitable growth, saving costs and fuelling <mark>innovation</mark>.</P><P>The consumer goods company was held up as a shining example to competitors at COP21 on account of its commitment to zero net deforestation by 2020, and again when it revealed that the next phase of its plan was to expand its <mark>sustainable</mark> supply chain initiative. Working alongside Dutch NGO Solidaridad, Unilever has pledged to reach deeper into its supply chain and deliver environmental benefits to the over one million people working, either directly or not, for the company.</P><P>Other notable examples include IKEA, whose commitment to sustainability was clear for all to see last year when the Swedish furniture maker pledged €1bn towards renewables and <mark>climate change</mark> adaptation in poorer nations; that’s on top of the €1.5bn spent since 2009. IKEA’s 23 wind farms and 700,000 solar panels will also go some way towards protecting the company from any price swings in the energy market. Special mention should go also to Tesla, whose recent achievements include advancing battery technology and emissions-free refuelling infrastructure across the globe, and to Patagonia, for repurposing its operational strategy time and again in order to reflect the <mark>climate</mark> question.</P><P>The aforementioned examples, as with many others, are living proof that a commitment to <mark>climate change</mark> need not come at the expense of profitability. More than that, they show that the private sector has some valuable answers on the <mark>climate</mark> question. “Consumers vote with their feet – and their wallets – if they feel companies are not transparent and trustworthy. So corporate reputations matter to the bottom line”, said Way.</P><P>Granted, there may be some business models that are ill-equipped to make quite the same stand. However, the fact remains that businesses have a responsibility to acknowledge what many consider to be the defining challenge of our time.</P><NAV class=""navigation post-navigation"" role=""navigation""><H2 class=""screen-reader-text"">Post navigation</H2></NAV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

Yet several prominent global warming skeptic organizations are actively working to sow doubt about the facts of global warming.</P><P>These organizations play a key role in the fossil fuel industry's &quot;disinformation playbook,&quot; a strategy designed to confuse the public about global warming and delay action on <mark>climate change</mark>. Why? Because the fossil fuel industry wants to sell more coal, oil, and gas — even though the science clearly shows that the resulting <mark>carbon</mark> emissions threaten our planet.</P><P>Who are these groups? And what is the evidence linking them to the fossil fuel industry?</P><P>Here's a quick primer on several prominent global warming skeptic organizations, including examples of their disinformation efforts and funding sources from the fossil fuel industry. Many have received large donations from foundations established, and supported, by the fossil fuel billionaire Koch brothers.</P><H3>American Enterprise Institute</H3><P>The American Enterprise Institute (AEI) has routinely tried to undermine the credibility of <mark>climate</mark> science, despite at times affirming that the “weight of the evidence” justifies “prudent action” on <mark>climate change</mark>. [1]</P><P>For years, AEI played a role in propagating misinformation about a manufactured controversy over emails stolen from <mark>climate</mark> scientists [2], with one AEI research fellow even claiming, “There was no consensus about the extent and causes of global warming.” [3] A resident scholar at AEI went so far as to state that the profession of <mark>climate</mark> scientist “threatens to overtake all” on the list of “most distrusted occupations.” [4]</P><P>AEI received $3,615,000 from ExxonMobil from 1998-2012 [5], and more than $1 million in funding from Koch foundations from 2004-2011. [6]</P><H3>Americans for Prosperity</H3><P>Americans for Prosperity (AFP) frequently provides a platform for <mark>climate</mark> contrarian statements, such as “How much information refutes <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide-caused global warming? Let me count the ways.” [7]</P><P>While claiming to be a grassroots organization, AFP has bolstered its list of “activists” by hosting “$1.84 Gas” events, where consumers who receive discounts on gasoline are asked to provide their name and email address on a “petition” form. [8] These events are billed as raising awareness about “failing energy policies” and high gasoline prices, but consumers are not told about AFP’s ties to oil interests, namely Koch Industries.</P><P>AFP has its origins in a group founded in 1984 by fossil fuel billionaires Charles and David Koch [9], and the latter Koch still serves on AFP Foundation’s board of directors [10]. Richard Fink, executive vice president of Koch Industries, also serves as a director for both AFP and AFP Foundation. [11]</P><P>Koch foundations donated $3,609,281 to AFP Foundation from 2007-2011. [12]</P><H3>American Legislative Exchange Council</H3><P>The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) maintains that “global <mark>climate change</mark> is inevitable” [13] and since the 1990s has pushed various forms of model legislation aimed at obstructing policies intended to reduce global warming emissions.</P><P>ALEC purports to “support the use of sound science to guide policy,” but routinely provides a one-sided platform for <mark>climate</mark> contrarians. State legislators attending one ALEC meeting were offered a workshop touting a report by a fossil fuel-funded group that declared “like love, <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide's many splendors are seemingly endless.&quot; [14, 15] Another ALEC meeting featured a Fox News contributor who has claimed on the air that <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide “literally cannot cause global warming.” [16, 17]</P><P>ALEC received more than $1.6 million from ExxonMobil from 1998-2012 [18], and more than $850,000 from Koch foundations from 1997-2011. [19]</P><H3>Beacon Hill Institute at Suffolk University</H3><P>From its position as the research arm of the Department of Economics at Suffolk University, the Beacon Hill Institute (BHI) has published misleading analyses of clean energy and <mark>climate change</mark> policies in more than three dozen states. </P><P>These economic analyses are at times accompanied by a dose of <mark>climate</mark> contrarianism. For example, BHI Director David Tuerck has claimed that “the very question of whether the <mark>climate</mark> is warming is in doubt…” [20] Claims such as “wind power actually increases <mark>pollution</mark>” can be found in many of BHI’s reports.</P><P>BHI has publicly acknowledged its Koch funding [21], which likely includes at least some of the approximately $725,000 the Charles G. Koch foundation contributed to Suffolk University from 2008-2011. [22]</P><H3>Cato Institute</H3><P>Cato acknowledges that “Global warming is indeed real…” But when it comes to the causes of global warming, Cato has sent mixed messages over the years. Cato's website, for instance, reports that “… human activity has been a contributor [to global warming] since 1975.” [23] Yet, on the same topic of whether human activity is responsible for global warming, Cato’s vice president has written: “We don’t know.” [24]</P><P>Patrick Michaels, Director of Cato’s Center for the Study of Science, has referred to the latest <A href=""https://www.ucsusa.org/testfolder/aa-migration-to-be-deleted/global-warming-delete-me/gw-science-and-impacts-delete-me/science-1/us-global-change-nca.html"" target=""_blank"">Draft National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment Report</A> as “the stuff of fantasy.” [25] The most recent edition of Cato’s “Handbook for Policymakers” advises that Congress should “pass no legislation restricting emissions of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide.” [26]</P><P>Charles Koch co-founded Cato in 1977. Both Charles and David Koch were among the four “shareholders” who “owned” Cato until 2011 [27], and the latter Koch remains a member of Cato’s Board of Directors. [28] Koch foundations contributed more than $5 million to Cato from 1997-2011. [29]</P><H3>Competitive Enterprise Institute</H3><P>The Competitive Enterprise Institute has at times acknowledged that “Global warming is a reality.” [30] But CEI has also routinely disputed that global warming is a problem, contending that “There is no ‘scientific consensus’ that global warming will cause damaging <mark>climate change</mark>.”  [31]</P><P>These kinds of claims are nothing new for CEI. Back in 1991, CEI was claiming that “The greatest challenge we face is not warming, but cooling.” [32] More recently, CEI produced an ad calling for higher levels of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide. [33] One CEI scholar even publicly compared a prominent <mark>climate</mark> scientist to convicted child molester Jerry Sandusky. [34]</P><P>CEI received around $2 million in funding from ExxonMobil from 1995-2005 [35], though ExxonMobil made a public break with CEI in 2007 after coming under scrutiny from UCS and other groups for its funding of <mark>climate</mark> contrarian organizations. CEI has also received funding from Koch foundations, dating back to the 1980s. [36]</P><H3>Heartland Institute</H3><P>While claiming to stand up for “sound science,” the Heartland Institute has routinely spread misinformation about <mark>climate</mark> science, including deliberate attacks on <mark>climate</mark> scientists. [37]</P><P>Popular outcry forced the Heartland Institute to pull down a controversial billboard that compared supporters of global warming facts to Unabomber Ted Kaczynski [38], bringing an early end to a planned campaign first announced in an essay by Heartland President Joseph Bast, which claimed “… the most prominent advocates of global warming aren’t scientists. They are murderers, tyrants, and madmen.” [39]</P><P>Heartland even once marked Earth Day by mailing out 100,000 free copies of a book claiming that “<mark>climate</mark> science has been corrupted” [40] – despite acknowledging that “…all major scientific organizations of the world have taken the official position that humankind is causing global warming.”</P><P>Heartland received more than $675,000 from ExxonMobil from 1997-2006 [41]. Heartland also raked in millions from the Koch-funded organization Donors Trust through 2011.

Additionally, we evaluated how proactive adaptation influenced economic impacts on select infrastructure types and developed first-order estimates of potential land losses associated with coastal erosion and lengthening of the coastal ice-free season for 12 communities. Cumulative estimated expenses from <mark>climate</mark>-related damage to infrastructure without adaptation measures (hereafter damages) from 2015 to 2099 totaled $5.5 billion (2015 dollars, 3% discount) for RCP8.5 and $4.2 billion for RCP4.5, suggesting that reducing greenhouse gas emissions could lessen damages by $1.3 billion this century. The distribution of damages varied across the state, with the largest damages projected for the interior and southcentral Alaska. The largest source of damages was road flooding caused by increased precipitation followed by damages to buildings associated with near-surface permafrost thaw. Smaller damages were observed for airports, railroads, and pipelines. Proactive adaptation reduced total projected cumulative expenditures to $2.9 billion for RCP8.5 and $2.3 billion for RCP4.5. For road flooding, adaptation provided an annual savings of 80–100% across four study eras. For nearly all infrastructure types and time periods evaluated, damages and adaptation costs were larger for RCP8.5 than RCP4.5. Estimated coastal erosion losses were also larger for RCP8.5.</P></DIV><UL class=""kwd-group""><LI class=""kwd""><A href=""/keyword/infrastructure"" class=""hw-term hw-article-keyword hw-article-keyword-infrastructure"" rel=""nofollow"">infrastructure</A></LI></UL><P id=""p-6"" class=""flushleft""><mark>Climate change</mark> at high latitudes is causing rapid and unprecedented environmental change.

In recent years, the analysis by Larsen et al. (<A id=""xref-ref-35-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-35"">35</A>) has served as a guide for considering damage to infrastructure in Alaska and the broader Arctic under different <mark>climate</mark> futures. Although this study has provided valuable insights, the authors noted that estimates could be improved considerably with a more comprehensive inventory of public infrastructure and the use of nonlinear damage functions that better capture relationships among environmental stressors, infrastructure lifespan, and the associated incremental change in capital and operation and maintenance costs (<A id=""xref-ref-35-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-35"">35</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-36-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-36"">36</A>).</P><P id=""p-10"">We addressed the recommendations made by Larsen et al.

Using high and low <mark>climate</mark> forcing scenarios [representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) and RCP4.5, respectively, from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)] (<A id=""xref-ref-37-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-37"">37</A>) for five general circulation models (GCMs), we evaluated the <mark>climate</mark>-related change in incurred costs (hereafter damages) required to maintain infrastructure. We estimated the benefits (or avoided damages) to infrastructure of global reductions in GHG emissions and identified where proactive adaptation measures may reduce <mark>climate change</mark>-related expenses. <mark>Climate</mark> model projections were incorporated into a reconfigured version of the Infrastructure Planning Support System (IPSS) software tool (<A id=""xref-ref-38-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-38"">38</A><A id=""xref-ref-39-1"" class=""xref-down-link"" href=""#ref-39""><SPAN>⇓</SPAN></A>–<A id=""xref-ref-40-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-40"">40</A>) that accounts for <mark>climate change</mark> impacts unique to northern latitudes, including near-surface permafrost thaw and extreme freeze–thaw dynamics. This model also considers damages from precipitation and precipitation-caused flooding. Independently, we developed an approach to generate first-order estimates of projected coastal erosion rates and evaluated how GHG mitigation may influence erosion in 12 coastal communities where immediate actions to manage erosion or relocate have been recommended (<A id=""xref-ref-33-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-33"">33</A>).

Costs incurred as a result of operation and maintenance or infrastructure replacement required irrespective of <mark>climate change</mark> are not included in the damage values. For precipitation, flooding, and freeze–thaw stressors, damages represent the expenditures required to maintain current levels of service, enabling the infrastructure to remain functional through the intended design lifespan. In the case of near-surface permafrost thaw, where repair approaches are limited, damages represent the cost of infrastructure replacement. Damage estimates reflect expenditures incurred when no adaptation measures are taken. Adaptation costs are quantified separately and explained in <A id=""xref-sec-5-1"" class=""xref-sec"" href=""#sec-5""><EM>Adaptation</EM></A>. Reported damages (and adaptation costs) reflect the difference between projected values and a historic baseline period (1986–2005) (detailed in <A id=""xref-sec-9-1"" class=""xref-sec"" href=""#sec-9""><EM>Methods</EM></A> and <A id=""xref-sec-27-1"" class=""xref-sec"" href=""#sec-27""><EM>SI Text</EM></A>) to isolate <mark>climate change</mark> impacts from weather variability not attributed to <mark>climate change</mark>. When the IPSS determines that infrastructure is in need of replacement, the model tabulates expenditures based on historical building standards and construction costs.

This pattern was observed across nearly all infrastructure types and environmental stressors considered in this analysis. The one exception was the negative values observed for freeze–thaw damages, which indicate that warming associated with unmitigated <mark>climate change</mark> may reduce future damages from this environmental stressor, especially to roads, to levels below those reported historically. However, this benefit provided little offset against total projected damages caused by other stressors.</P><P id=""p-26"">Mean annual projected damages (undiscounted; summed for all evaluated environmental stressors) varied by infrastructure type and RCP across study eras (<A id=""xref-fig-2-1"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">Fig. 2</A>). Roads exhibited increased annual damages over time that were consistently higher for RCP8.5, with the largest differences observed in the 2090 era ($212 million y<SUP>−1</SUP> vs. $109 million y<SUP>−1</SUP> for RCP8.5 and RCP4.5, respectively) (<A id=""xref-fig-2-2"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">Fig. 2<EM>A</EM></A>). This pattern was driven primarily by increased flood-related damages, which totaled about $58 million y<SUP>−1</SUP> in the 2030 era and reached $165 million y<SUP>−1</SUP> in 2090 for RCP8.5. In contrast, annual building damages were projected to be largest in the 2030 era ($84 million for RCP8.5) (<A id=""xref-fig-2-3"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">Fig. 2<EM>B</EM></A>) and decrease over time, with smaller relative differences between RCPs than observed for roads. For buildings, annual changes over time were driven primarily by near-surface permafrost thaw. Some of the GCMs projected complete loss of near-surface permafrost from much of interior Alaska by the end of the century (<A id=""xref-fig-3-1"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F3"">Fig. S1</A>), suggesting that no additional damages from this environmental stressor would occur in some areas and therefore, total statewide damages in later eras would decrease. It is possible that deeper, ice-rich permafrost could cause subsidence at the local scale and result in future damages, even if near-surface permafrost is lost; however, these impacts were not evaluated in this analysis. Additionally, our model included the assumption that, if a building was damaged to the point that replacement was required, the new building would (when possible) not be built on permafrost or that additional measures would be taken to reduce the likelihood of future damages from this stressor. For airports, the 2090 era incurred the largest annual damages for RCP8.5 ($22 million y<SUP>−1</SUP>) and the smallest damages for RCP4.5 (11 million y<SUP>−1</SUP>) (<A id=""xref-fig-2-4"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">Fig. 2<EM>C</EM></A>). Airport runway damages from flooding and precipitation as well as near-surface permafrost thaw impacts on airport buildings contributed to the observed pattern in damages across eras for this infrastructure type. For railroads and pipelines, near-surface permafrost thaw was the only environmental stressor modeled. Both these infrastructure types showed the largest damages in the 2070 era for RCP8.5 (<A id=""xref-fig-2-5"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F2"">Fig. 2 <EM>D</EM> and <EM>E</EM></A>), which is likely because of a large change in near-surface permafrost during this timeframe. However, railroads tended toward larger damages in earlier eras, whereas pipeline damages increased over time, especially for RCP8.5.

Generally, this initiation of adaptation resulted in larger annual adaptation costs (and smaller relative adaptation benefits compared with damages) during the 2030 era.

Using this approach, they projected a 10–45% reduction in economic impacts from 2006 to 2080 under a moderate GHG emissions scenario. Our analysis suggests a much larger benefit of adaptation, indicating a 45–47% reduction in expenditures compared with damages when no adaptation measures are taken. We attribute this difference to our proactive adaptation method, where action is taken before deterioration of structures, to maintain the full lifespan. This approach can result in upfront investments that are lower than replacement costs and reduced future vulnerability, which led to the observed increase in benefits over time for many of the infrastructure type–<mark>climate</mark> stressor relationships that we modeled.</P><P id=""p-44"">Estimated annual damages to infrastructure stemming from the added environmental stresses (above normal “wear and tear”) caused by <mark>climate change</mark> could have large financial implications if our projections translate to realized damages and adaptation costs. For the 2030 era, mean annual damages were approximately $181 and $142 million for RCP8.5 and RCP4.5, respectively (sum of all infrastructure types is in <A id=""xref-fig-1-3"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F1"">Fig. 1</A>) and are projected to increase over time. These values represent 14–18% of the fiscal year 2017 capital budget request for the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities (<A id=""xref-ref-45-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-45"">45</A>). In this budget, $8 million was requested specifically for “Deferred Maintenance, Renewal, Repair and Equipment,” which is a decrease from recent years, where enacted appropriations totaled $25–27 million to address this need (<A href=""https://www.omb.alaska.gov/html/budget-report/fy-2016-budget.html"" class=""in-nw"">https://www.omb.alaska.gov/html/budget-report/fy-2016-budget.html</A>). Collectively, this information suggests that <mark>climate</mark>-related damages could place an additional strain on state finances. We are aware of only one other study that has estimated annual <mark>climate change</mark> damages for Alaska’s public infrastructure. Relying on a limited number of examples, Cole et al. (<A id=""xref-ref-34-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-34"">34</A>) suggested that <mark>climate</mark> damages could reach about $50 million y<SUP>−1</SUP> (converted to 2015 dollars using the Consumer Price Index) in the near term. The large difference between these findings and our results is likely driven by our more comprehensive inventory, which includes more than just state-owned public infrastructure, and thorough evaluation of dominant <mark>climate</mark> stressors, especially inclusion of projected flooding damages.</P><P id=""p-45"">Multiple factors contributed to our estimated extent, timing, and distribution of damages. For each infrastructure type, the quantity of infrastructure included in our inventory, the unique engineering-based stressor–response functions developed for that infrastructure, and the price of maintenance and repair of that type of structure affected projected damages. The timing of damages was impacted by the rate of change of each environmental stressor and the sensitivity of each type of infrastructure to the change. Distribution of damages across the state and individual boroughs was affected by the quantity and location of infrastructure and the impact of the environmental stressors at any given location. For instance, the southcentral borough of Valdez-Cordova includes among the highest total road area in our inventory and is in a region projected to have a relatively large increase in precipitation for many of the GCMs (<A id=""xref-fig-7-3"" class=""xref-fig"" href=""#F7"">Fig. S2<EM>B</EM></A>), which strongly influenced the projected cumulative flooding damages for that borough.</P><P id=""p-46"">We did not estimate <mark>climate</mark> damages associated with coastal erosion in the IPSS analysis; however, our infrastructure inventory included assets in coastal communities, and therefore, damages from modeled environmental stressors are reflected in the reported damages and adaptation costs. We excluded coastal erosion from the economic analysis because our approach represents a first-order approximation of rates that relied heavily on the assumption that the projected lengthening of the coastal ice-free season is proportional to changes in coastal erosion. Although this relationship has been noted (<A id=""xref-ref-46-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-46"">46</A>), we determined that improved understanding of this linkage is needed to appropriately project <mark>climate</mark>-related erosion damages. Also, many of the coastal communities experiencing erosion problems are affected by both river and ocean processes (<A id=""xref-ref-33-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-33"">33</A>), making <mark>climate</mark> and source attribution more challenging. Despite these limitations, the underlying literature indicates a strong likelihood of a lengthening of the coastal ice-free season throughout this century, and our projections show that, for many communities, global GHG emissions reduction could reduce erosion, thereby lessening impacts.</P><P id=""p-47"">This study describes an improved approach to quantifying <mark>climate</mark> damages to public infrastructure, but these estimates could be further strengthened. Additional modeling capabilities that build on the stressor–response relationships developed here along with creation of new functions that capture damages to ports, telecommunications, and other infrastructure types would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of potential vulnerabilities and associated damages. Improved knowledge of the influence of a lengthening coastal ice-free season on coastal infrastructure would further refine our ability to estimate potential damages from <mark>climate change</mark>. Continued updates and expansion of our infrastructure inventory, which includes counts and more detailed location information of infrastructure, would also better inform damage estimates and adaptation costs. Additionally, analysis at a finer resolution would allow for community-level evaluation and reduce assumptions about infrastructure distribution, which could be especially important for accurately projecting damages from near-surface permafrost thaw. Projections of deep, ice-rich permafrost thaw could also improve estimates of damages from this stressor. Quantification of loss of use impacts would also inform potential damages and could be particularly meaningful in Alaska, where there is a lack of infrastructure redundancy across much of the state. Within the <mark>climate</mark> modeling framework, inclusion of additional GCMs, <mark>climate</mark> scenarios, and <mark>climate</mark> sensitivities could provide a more robust evaluation of the range and variability of projected damages and adaptation costs. Finally, new economic opportunities will be made possible by <mark>climate change</mark>, including longer ice-free seasons for ports. Future research combining our analytical approach with projections of future socioeconomics, demand, technology, and new infrastructure siting could provide a more comprehensive estimate of future impacts.</P><P id=""p-48"">This study provides new estimates of the potential damages from <mark>climate change</mark> to Alaska public infrastructure and suggests that taking proactive action to adapt infrastructure in the near term could dramatically reduce damages across the state throughout this century. Variation and general trends in the timing of damages and relative adaptation benefits to different infrastructure types may help to inform decisions about prioritizing investments. Together with global reductions in GHG emissions, these efforts may reduce damages to infrastructure and the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on Alaskan communities.</P></DIV><DIV class=""section methods"" id=""sec-9""><H2 class="""">Methods</H2><P id=""p-49"" class=""flushleft"">Estimated damages to public infrastructure from <mark>climate change</mark> and costs when adaptation measures are used were evaluated using downscaled <mark>climate</mark> model projections and the IPSS software tool (<A id=""xref-ref-38-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-38"">38</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-39-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-39"">39</A>).

Stressor–response relationships are specific to each environmental stressor and infrastructure combination. Damages are quantified using engineering- and material science-based relationships between each environmental stressor and the extent of damages associated with the projected amount of change in the stressor after an empirically determined threshold is crossed. For precipitation, flooding, and freeze–thaw stressors, damages reflect the expenditures required to maintain current levels of service and allow infrastructure to remain functional through the intended design lifespan. In the case of permafrost, where repair approaches are limited, damages represent only the expenditures required for infrastructure replacement. Damages are calculated by first determining the extent of damage caused by each environmental stressor and then applying a monetary value of those damages based on known construction and maintenance costs. These calculations are unique to each stressor–response relationship and detailed in the following sections. Modeled damages represent only those costs attributed to the incremental change in expenditures caused by the projected <mark>climate change</mark>. Estimates presented here do not include operation and maintenance costs from normal wear and tear, damages caused by factors other than the evaluated <mark>climate</mark> variables, or replacement costs of structures resulting from infrastructure reaching the end of its design lifespan.</P></DIV><DIV id=""sec-14"" class=""subsection""><H4>Modeling adaptation costs.</H4><P id=""p-54"">The IPSS models proactive adaptation for infrastructure type–<mark>climate</mark> stressor combinations where effective adaptation methods exist and costs are quantifiable. Adaptation is applied in the form of upgrades to units of infrastructure when structures are determined to be vulnerable to a <mark>climate change</mark> stressor. In some cases, adaptation is determined to be cost-effective (i.e., adaptation costs &lt; estimated damages), but in other instances, adaptation costs may be more than estimated damages. For instance, for permafrost thaw, no adaptation measures were identified that were less expensive than infrastructure reconstruction. Generally, the extent of adaptation required for a given unit of infrastructure is determined by the projected change in each individual stressor through the design lifespan of the infrastructure. After a unit of infrastructure is adapted, it is assumed that future vulnerability to <mark>climate</mark> damages is minimal and no additional <mark>climate</mark>-related costs or damages are incurred in the model through the end of the intended design lifespan.</P></DIV><DIV id=""sec-15"" class=""subsection""><H4>Historical baseline.</H4><P id=""p-55"">We calculated the difference between our estimated damages (and adaptation costs) and damages that would have been incurred in a historical baseline period (1986–2005).

By reporting the difference between these values, the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> are isolated from historical baseline maintenance costs. Detailed methods for generating the historical baseline are outlined in <A id=""xref-sec-27-6"" class=""xref-sec"" href=""#sec-27""><EM>SI Text</EM></A>.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""sec-16"" class=""subsection""><H3>IPSS Considerations for Northern Latitudes.</H3><P id=""p-56"">Assessing potential infrastructure damages at high latitudes requires specific considerations and model modifications for extreme low temperatures. This study incorporated these cold weather conditions in three specific stressor categories: pavement temperature, FTCs, and near-surface permafrost thaw. Weather conditions in Alaska can lead to costs that are two to three times the typical construction, operations, and maintenance costs found in the contiguous United States across infrastructure types (RSMeans 2015; <A href=""https://rsmeansonline.com/"" class=""in-nw"">https://rsmeansonline.com/</A>), and consideration of these higher costs was incorporated into the damage estimates. However, design standards modeled here are assumed to be comparable with those used in the contiguous United States.</P><DIV id=""sec-17"" class=""subsection""><H4>Pavement temperature impacts on roads.</H4><P id=""p-57"">An important factor in determining whether pavement damage will occur with <mark>climate change</mark> is the ability of the pavement to withstand changes in temperature. Pavements are designed for specific minimum and maximum temperature limits, and environmental changes beyond these limits have the potential to damage pavement surfaces. For this study, when <mark>climate</mark> projections indicated a potential threshold change from the baseline <mark>climate</mark> temperature range, it was assumed that pavement was more likely to be damaged, and a cost was applied at the time that the threshold was crossed to account for pavement binder reconstruction expenditures. Specific road surface temperature and binder thresholds were determined from changes in minimum (1 d) and maximum (7-d average) temperatures using equations and research reported in the work by Mills et al. (<A id=""xref-ref-52-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-52"">52</A>).

We used two methods to calculate FTC impacts on road and runway maintenance costs and damages. We determined whether changes in precipitation and temperature placed the infrastructure within a given <mark>climate</mark> grid cell in a new pavement performance zone. These zones were characterized by the Freezing Degree Index and mean annual precipitation, which were combined to place the grid cells in wet or dry zones and high or low FTC environmental zones (<A id=""xref-ref-31-2"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-31"">31</A>) (detailed in <A id=""xref-sec-27-7"" class=""xref-sec"" href=""#sec-27""><EM>SI Text</EM></A>). When projected <mark>climate change</mark> indicated that a geographic area crossed into a new zone, specific increases were applied to the maintenance costs for the affected road and runway segments. We used a second method when <mark>climate change</mark> did not cause a threshold crossing into a different zone, but increased FTC could still result in damages. For this approach, we quantified climatic changes based on the percentage increase in frequency of FTC for a rolling 5-y period relative to the historic baseline. Costs were estimated based on corresponding increases in routine maintenance to repair freeze–thaw-related road and runway damages (<A id=""xref-ref-31-3"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-31"">31</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-53-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-53"">53</A>).</P></DIV><DIV id=""sec-19"" class=""subsection""><H4>Near-surface permafrost thaw.</H4><P id=""p-59"">Near-surface permafrost thaw affects all types of infrastructure but in different ways depending on whether the infrastructure is located above or below the ground and the potential for underlying permafrost to thaw if permafrost is present (<A id=""xref-ref-20-5"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-20"">20</A>, <A id=""xref-ref-54-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-54"">54</A>). Permafrost thaw impacts the soil bearing underneath structures and may weaken foundations, creating risks directly related to the capacity of the soil to bear the weight of the support structures for the infrastructure. The broad foundations of buildings may be affected differently than linear elements, like rail and pipelines, which have specific support points that hold the infrastructure in place. If near-surface permafrost thaws and GIC is reduced, soil will subside, and infrastructure failure will occur when the subsidence amount exceeds the allowance of the construction materials to bend to the stresses (<A id=""xref-ref-55-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-55"">55</A>).</P><P id=""p-60"">We assessed changing vulnerability from near-surface permafrost thaw for roads, buildings, rail, and pipelines. First, we overlaid the infrastructure inventory with current and projected ALT and GIC maps. For buildings, we developed a risk assessment that assigns potential risk because of near-surface permafrost thaw based on a spatially centered value in each <mark>climate</mark> grid cell. Second, we implemented a threshold approach based on permafrost distribution, GIC, and projected change in MAGT to determine when critical foundation damage was likely to occur (detailed in <A id=""xref-sec-27-8"" class=""xref-sec"" href=""#sec-27""><EM>SI Text</EM></A> and <A id=""xref-table-wrap-6-1"" class=""xref-table"" href=""#T6"">Tables S4</A> and <A id=""xref-table-wrap-7-1"" class=""xref-table"" href=""#T7"">S5</A>) that would require rebuilding or retrofit of the entire building. For roads, railroads, and pipelines, we determined where thaw settlement was likely to cause asset failure and the lengths of pipe and rail where replacement would be required, thereby incurring costs (<A id=""xref-ref-56-1"" class=""xref-bibr"" href=""#ref-56"">56</A>). Costs were applied based on total estimated cost of replacement using specific inventory data and RSMeans cost estimates (2016; <A href=""https://rsmeansonline.com/"" class=""in-nw"">https://rsmeansonline.com/</A>), with customized adjustments made for the Arctic conditions based on available data. When near-surface permafrost was lost for a given location, no additional damages to infrastructure were incurred from this environmental stressor. Methods for adapting infrastructure to near-surface permafrost thaw are limited and costly. Approaches modeled in the IPSS after the damage threshold was crossed included modifying the base of the infrastructure and installing thermosyphons to maintain lower soil temperatures.</P><DIV id=""T6"" class=""table pos-float type-supplementary-material""><DIV class=""table-inline table-callout-links""><DIV class=""callout""><SPAN>View this table:</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Gen. Gerald Galloway, who is now a University of Maryland engineering professor.</P><P>U.S. military operations, personnel and installations are already being affected by the increased risk of instability overseas as a result of <mark>climate change</mark>, and dealing with it will require international cooperation, he said.</P><P>Trump's decision, which he dramatically announced in the White House Rose Garden, will have &quot;an immediate effect&quot; on the relationship with U.S. allies, Galloway said.</P><P>&quot;We need our allies to be dealing with this the same way we are, so the concern is that pulling out of the existing treaty sends a message that we don't really care about the issue,&quot; he said. &quot;Mattis has already said, 'I am going to be worried about this,' but it's the concern that [Trump's announcement] will be taken as the definitive statement.&quot;</P><P>It was a concern echoed on Wednesday by Secretary-General of the United Nations Antonio Guterres.</P><P>He warned the U.S. that &quot;if one country decides to leave a void, I can guarantee someone else will occupy it.&quot; The only other countries not in the accord are Syria and Nicaragua.</P><P>&quot;Around the world, military strategists view <mark>climate change</mark> as a threat to global peace and security,&quot; he said in a speech at New York University. &quot;We are all aware of the political turmoil and societal tensions that have been generated by the mass movement of refugees.&quot;</P><P>On a more basic level, extreme weather patterns and rising sea levels are already having an effect on U.S. military facilities.</P><P><A href=""http://www.military.com/base-guide/naval-base-ventura-county"" target=""_blank"">Naval Base Ventura County</A> in southern California has lost about 400 feet of beach since the 1940s.

The report calculated that a three-foot sea level rise would threaten at least 128 U.S. military bases, which are valued at $100 billion. Nine of those are major hubs for the U.S. Navy.</P><P>Earlier this month, a group of 17 retired military officers sent letters to Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urging them to remain firm in their commitment to combat <mark>climate change</mark> as the White House weighed leaving the accord.</P><P>&quot;<mark>Climate change</mark> poses strategically significant risks to U.S. national security, directly impacting our critical infrastructure and increasing the likelihood of humanitarian disasters, state failure and conflict,&quot; they wrote.</P><P>___</P><P><EM>This article is written by Vera Bergengruen from Special to McClatchy Washington Bureau and was legally licensed via the Tribune Content Agency through the <A href=""https://www.newscred.com/"" target=""_blank"">NewsCred</A> publisher network.

As part of Mars’ legacy <mark>Sustainable</mark> in a Generation plan, we set a goal to eliminate 100% of the GHG emissions from our direct operations by 2040.  On the way to that, we set and delivered a 2015 goal of a 25% reduction.  We’re now resetting our baseline to 2015 as part of the larger <mark>Sustainable</mark> in a Generation Plan.  From this 2015 base we will still deliver a 100% reduction by 2040 and a 20% reduction by 2020 on top of our progress to date. This goal covers the energy use from about 420 sites in more than 80 countries.</P></DIV><DIV class=""right""><H3>HEALTHY PLANET</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></FORM></BODY></HTML>"
