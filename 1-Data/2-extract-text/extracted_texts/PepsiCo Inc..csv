The tool, called <STRONG>WaterLoupe</STRONG>, tracks data on social, economic and <mark>climate</mark> factors impacting water availability within river basins and displays the information on a highly visual dashboard.</P><P>Deltares developed the dashboard based on a study of the Aburrá and Cauca Valley catchment areas in Colombia, where Kimberly-Clark operates manufacturing facilities. Kimberly-Clark plans to use the WaterLoupe tool in the high-risk river basins where it operates manufacturing facilities by 2022. In the meantime, the companies are sharing the dashboard with their NGO partners and other manufacturers to get feedback and make improvements. To integrate stakeholder input, the WaterLoupe dashboard was designed as an open-source tool that can be expanded to include information as requested.</P><P>“We recognize that the communities surrounding mills experiencing water stress have important social needs as well, so engagement at the local community level will help stakeholders leverage this tool and see the factors driving water risk and explore <mark>sustainable</mark> stewardship strategies,” said <STRONG>Lisa Morden</STRONG>, global head of sustainability at Kimberly-Clark. “Ultimately, we hope to use this system to test the impact of different water management approaches on local water supply and consumption.”</P><P>The introduction of WaterLoupe is the latest step in Kimberly-Clark's global water risk management and <A href=""/news_and_views/organizational_change/<mark>sustainable</mark>_brands/kimberly-clark_concludes_successful_5-year"">Sustainability 2022</A> programs.</P><H3 class=""green""><STRONG>New PepsiCo, Nature Conservancy Project to Reduce Pressure on a High-Risk Watershed While Supporting U.S. Farmers</STRONG></H3><P><STRONG><A href=""/corporate/pepsico"">PepsiCo</A></STRONG> and <STRONG><A href=""/news_and_views/Nature%20Conservancy/all"">The Nature Conservancy</A></STRONG> marked the next stage of their <A href=""/news_and_views/collaboration/aarthi_rayapura/pepsico_nature_conservancy_team_increase_recycling_prot"">multi-year collaboration in the U.S.</A> today with the <A href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/world-water-day-pepsico-and-the-nature-conservancy-announce-new-water-conservation-projects-in-southwestern-states-300616862.html?tc=eml_cleartime"" target=""_blank"">announcement of further work</A> along the <STRONG>Salt and Verde watershed</STRONG>. The Verde and Salt River valleys are part of the wider Colorado River system, which is the primary source of water across the Southwest. PepsiCo and The Nature Conservancy say their shared goal is to maximize the health and vibrancy of the system through scalable solutions for integrated water management.</P><P>In 2017, PepsiCo’s support enabled 110 million gallons of water to be replenished in the Verde River valley through projects managed under the <STRONG>Salt and Verde Alliance</STRONG>, a collective of communities, corporations, farmers, and other organizations with an interest in the watershed. As part of this, The Nature Conservancy helped <STRONG>Hauser and Hauser Farms</STRONG>, the largest multi-generational farm in the area, switch from flood irrigation to a more efficient drip irrigation technique, keeping more water in the Verde River. The new 2018 project will support the same farm in switching from cultivation of alfalfa to barley, a crop that utilizes water primarily when the river's level is naturally at its highest, and limits water withdrawal during dry months. To make it a more financially viable alternative crop and help encourage other farmers to make similar changes, The Nature Conservancy and partners will also be opening Arizona’s first malt house.</P><P>“These projects bring together farmers and other key stakeholders to <A href=""/news_and_views/collaboration/roberta_barbieri/feel_rising_water_pressure_how_business_must_lead_cons"">address local watershed challenges in a collaborative way</A>,” said <STRONG>Roberta Barbieri</STRONG>, VP of Global Sustainability at PepsiCo. “Our approach is underscored by a belief that, by considering environmental, social and economic factors together, <mark>sustainable</mark>, systemic change can be brought about. The Nature Conservancy's work in the Verde and Salt River valleys, with PepsiCo's support, is a model for how high-risk watersheds around the world can be sustainably managed.”</P><P>Alongside the extension of their work in Arizona, the partnership also announced projects in Utah and Texas. The Nature Conservancy plans to acquire land and water rights on the Price River, UT to protect local water flows and ecosystems while benefitting drinking water sources, agricultural communities and endangered fish. This long-term project is intended to deliver 200 million gallons of water benefits each year. PepsiCo is also supporting The Nature Conservancy’s management of a 5,000 acre preserve at Cibolo Bluffs, TX to safeguard an aquifer that provides water for almost two million Texans and habitat for the largest population of bats in the world <STRONG>–</STRONG> 20 million Mexican free-tailed bats.</P><P>These projects tie into <A href=""/news_and_views/collaboration/<mark>sustainable</mark>_brands/pepsico_reports_first_year_progress_against_performa"">PepsiCo’s ‘Performance with Purpose’ 2025 goals</A>, one of which is to return all the water it consumes in manufacturing operations located in high water-risk areas to the same watershed from which it is taken.</P><H3 class=""green""><STRONG>Gap, Target Set New Water Conservation Goals</STRONG></H3><P><STRONG><A href=""/news_and_views/GAP/all"">Gap Inc.</A></STRONG> announced an ambitious <A href=""http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gap-inc-unveils-new-<mark>sustainable</mark>-manufacturing-goal-to-conserve-10-billion-liters-of-water-by-the-end-of-2020-1018920616"" target=""_blank"">new manufacturing goal</A> to conserve a total of 10 billion liters of water by the end of 2020 — the equivalent volume of the daily drinking water need for 5 billion people. To achieve this, the company promises improvements along its <A href=""/news_and_views/organizational_change/renee_henze/thinking_more_sustainably_across_apparel_supply_cha"">clothing supply chain</A> and to its products, as well as continued collaborative efforts with NGOs and others.</P><P>&quot;We believe that access to clean and safe drinking water is a fundamental human right, so we strive to ensure that the process of making our clothes is safe for people and communities. It’s not only the right thing for people and the planet, it’s also crucial for our business growth,” said <STRONG>David Hayer</STRONG>, SVP of Global Sustainability and President of <STRONG>Gap Foundation</STRONG>.</P><P>Since 2014, the apparel maker has saved 2.4 billion liters of water through various projects, product <mark>innovation</mark>s and efficiency improvements at fabric mills and laundries. At the product level, Gap has saved more than 100 million liters of water through its smart denim wash program, <STRONG>Washwell</STRONG>, since its launch in 2016. The company claims that the process reduces water use by 20 percent or more. Improvements at the mill level have been a priority since 2013, when the company launched a Mill Sustainability Program to improve social and environmental practices at fabric mills. Improving wastewater quality from its denim laundries has been managed through a Water Quality Program since 2004; a program that has grown from ensuring proper wastewater treatment to actively monitoring and improving wastewater quality from the facilities. Gap further encourages its suppliers to conduct environmental footprint assessments <SPAN style=""font-size: 13px;"">—</SPAN> which include water use — using the <STRONG><mark>Sustainable</mark> Apparel Coalition</STRONG>’s (SAC) <STRONG><A href=""/news_and_views/collaboration/<mark>sustainable</mark>_brands/sacs_latest_higg_module_improves_apparel_supply_chai"">Higg Index</A></STRONG>.</P><P>Gap is a founding member of the SAC’s <STRONG><A href=""/news_and_views/collaboration/<mark>sustainable</mark>_brands/new_apparel_institute_aims_scale_<mark>sustainable</mark>_solutio"">Apparel Impact Institute</A></STRONG> and plans to continue to work with other brands and NGOs through such programs. To name a few, Gap is a signatory of the <STRONG>United Nations Global Compact CEO Water Mandate</STRONG>, is a member of the <STRONG>Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals</STRONG> (ZDHC) Programme, and is working with the <STRONG><A href=""/news_and_views/marketing_comms/<mark>sustainable</mark>_brands/new_mapping_tool_aims_strengthen_supplier_environm"">Natural Resources Defense Council</A></STRONG>’s (NRDC) <STRONG><A href=""/news_and_views/chemistry_materials/<mark>sustainable</mark>_brands/businesscase_gap_hm_levis_target_mills_save_14"">Clean by Design</A></STRONG> program, which is focused on helping mills improve their operational efficiencies to reduce water, energy and chemical use.</P><P>Meanwhile, <STRONG><A href=""/corporate/target"">Target</A></STRONG> has also joined the ZDHC Programme, and a related new target was part of its World Water Day announcement. The retailer is building on its existing water management practices with a new “<A href=""https://corporate.target.com/article/2018/03/freshwater-stewardship-approach"" target=""_blank"">freshwater stewardship approach</A>” created in partnership with the <STRONG><A href=""/news_and_views/WWF/all"">World Wildlife Fund</A></STRONG> (WWF).</P><P>Target used WWF’s <A href=""/news_and_views/organizational_change/brynn_mcnally/valuing_invaluable_how_wwf_helping_companies_prot""><STRONG>water risk assessment</STRONG></A> to review its water use reduction efforts across its supply chain. From there, it was able to develop an approach that acknowledges <A href=""/news_and_views/new_metrics/rylan_dobson/why_water_scarcity-adjusted_targets_are_not_context-based_wa"">water as part of a bigger global system</A>, and aims to address how the retailer can improve water quality, optimize water efficiency, and increase access to clean water. Target will initially focus its efforts in four main areas: raw materials, manufacturing, direct operations, and beyond the fenceline.</P><P>“Freshwater resources are more precious and vulnerable than people realize. Challenges, such as <mark>climate change</mark>, population growth, changing consumption patterns, are putting our freshwater systems increasingly at risk, and the need for action to address these issues is abundantly clear,” said <STRONG>Sheila Bonini</STRONG>, SVP of private sector engagement at WWF. “Target’s approach provides a holistic vision to drive solutions that will bring us closer to a <mark>sustainable</mark> and water-secure future.”</P><P>Its raw material focus is on cotton: The retailer has renewed its goal to <A href=""/news_and_views/walking_talk/<mark>sustainable</mark>_brands/trending_stella_mccartney_patagonia_target_deliver_bi"">source 100 percent <mark>sustainable</mark> cotton</A> for owned brand and exclusive national brand products by 2022. Manufacturing targets include to: Improve water efficiency in textile dyeing and finishing factories located in priority watersheds by 15 percent by 2022; Use water-saving design principles in 100 percent of owned brand apparel by 2025; and Have all owned brand apparel textile facilities in compliance with the ZDHC Progressive level wastewater standard by 2025. Its stores, distribution centers and headquarters locations are aiming for a 15 percent absolute water reduction by 2025 (with a 2010 baseline). Target further plans to investigate its position on water quality within its U.S. building operations over the next two years. Finally, the retailer reiterated its intention to collaborate across sectors, make philanthropic contributions, etc., starting with a $1 million investment in <STRONG><A href=""https://water.org/"" target=""_blank"">Water.org</A></STRONG> to help remove barriers to the access of affordable financing for water and sanitation in the communities where Target’s goods are produced.</P><H3 class=""green""><STRONG>Water for People, Absolut Elyx Invite Us to Raise a Glass to Help Solve the Global Water Crisis</STRONG></H3><P>The <STRONG>Raise It Forward</STRONG> campaign will contribute safe water to communities where <STRONG><A href=""http://waterforpeople.org/"" target=""_blank"">Water For People</A></STRONG> works based on social media engagement from today, World Water Day, through Earth Day (April 22). Every time someone posts a picture of raising a glass, adds the hashtag #RaiseItForward and mentions @WaterForPeople and @AbsolutElyx, <STRONG><A href=""/news_and_views/marketing_comms/<mark>sustainable</mark>_brands/absolut_bares_it_all_humorous_transparency_campaig"">Absolut Elyx</A></STRONG> will contribute one week’s worth of safe water (140 liters) through the global nonprofit.</P><P>Anyone around the world is invited to participate, and the toast can be done with anything — not just a glass of water or Absolut Elyx. A similar campaign in 2017 led to over 672,000 liters of water donated based on over 4,800 posts across Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.</P><P>The campaign is part of a <A href=""https://www.waterforpeople.org/elyx"" target=""_blank"">five-year partnership</A> between the organizations, which intends to bring access to safe water to more than 100,000 people worldwide and has done so for 30,000 people so far. In addition to #RaiseItForward, Absolut Elyx contributes to Water For People through events, purchases of Elyx Bottles and Elyx Boutique copper products. For every purchase made from the <STRONG><A href=""http://elyxboutique.com/"" target=""_blank"">Elyx Boutique</A></STRONG>, a week’s worth of safe water is donated to those who need it.</P><P>“#RaiseItForward is a great campaign to bring awareness to the <A href=""/news_and_views/marketing_comms/<mark>sustainable</mark>_brands/pg_nat_geo_shed_light_global_water_crisis_new_docu"">global water crisis</A>, while making a real difference for people who live without safe water around the world,” said Water For People CEO <STRONG>Eleanor Allen</STRONG>. “We are grateful for the long-term partnership with Absolut Elyx.

Her bland recitation of the accomplishments of <A href=""http://www.refresheverything.com/"">Pepsi Refresh</A>, a decent, though hardly groundbreaking corporate social responsibility program, had some attendees wondering if it was a paid product placement. That’s why I was surprised to hear Chris Anderson, TED’s director, single Nooyi’s talk out for special attention at a lunch for journalists as both a great talk and a stellar example of corporate communication.</P><P>The discordant note is an example of TED’s at times uneasy relationship to corporate sponsorship as the nonprofit organization pursues its future as a global media brand focused on learning and social change. While product demos, especially of new technology, have always been part of TED, there were many who felt that the balance of corporate voices was off this year.</P><P>“There were four talks about cars [<A href=""http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=93"">Bill Ford</A> and <A href=""http://www.boston-power.com/node/949"">Christina Lampe-Ommerud</A>, whose company makes electric car batteries, as well as Dennis Hong’s <A href=""//www.fastcompany.com/1734356/blind-people-drive-paralyzed-people-walk-at-ted"">car for the blind</A> and Google’s <A href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/10/what-were-driving-at.html"">self-driving car</A>], and two car commercials,” shown during TED, said Alex Steffen, author of <A href=""http://www.amazon.com/Worldchanging-Revised-Updated-Users-Century/dp/0810997460/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1299252730&amp;sr=1-1"">Worldchanging</A> and a longtime TEDster. “There were no talks by people who directly engaged the science of or solutions to <mark>climate change</mark>, or who pointed out that transportation is the single largest contributor to the problem.”</P><P>TED Talks now have over 400 million views, and the self-organized TEDx program has gone viral, with over 1,800 events taking place around the world. Initiatives such as TED Conversations, a set of new social tools on TED.com, TED ED, a new education site, and the $100,000 TED prize require significant corporate sponsorship. One attempt to respond to this increasing involvement with sponsorship is the “<A href=""//www.fastcompany.com/1734531/10-ads-worth-sharing-according-to-ted"">Ads Worth Spreading</A>” contest, wherein TED asked companies to create long-form video ads that were good enough to share.</P><P>“To make a difference in this world, you have to engage corporations,” Chris Anderson told the press. “We want to change how corporations talk to us–they should talk to us like adults.” While many of the commercials, which were shown to TED’s paying audience, were funny, heartwarming or inspiring, it remains unclear, at least to me, how commissioning more appealing ads relates to TED’s core mission, or how it will really elevate the conversation.</P></DIV><DIV class=""ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobilerectangle_1""><DIV class=""ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap""><DIV class=""ad-wrapper__ad-slug"">advertisement</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV><P>[<EM>Image: <A href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/tedconference/"">TED Conference</A> on Flickr</EM>]</P></DIV></ARTICLE><FOOTER class=""post__footer""><DIV class=""author author--post""><H4 class=""author__title"">About the author</H4><P class=""author__description"">Anya Kamenetz is the author of Generation Debt (Riverhead, 2006) and DIY U: Edupunks, Edupreneurs, and the Coming Transformation of Higher Education, (Chelsea Green, 2010).

To understand this paradoxical turn of events, it helps to recall the 1980s, when the world's governments banded together to fix the Antarctic <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/experts-ozone-hole-in-atmosphere-not-on-ground"">ozone hole</A>, a continent-size gap in the atmospheric layer that protects human beings, among other living things, from the sun's damaging ultraviolet radiation. Via the international treaty that entered into force in 1989 known as the Montreal Protocol, participants agreed to phase out the chemicals that harmed ozone. Closing the hole became one of the globe's greatest and most successful environmental restoration projects. But today, there is a glitch: The touted solution for the ozone predicament could in fact exacerbate our greatest environmental challenge—<mark>climate change</mark>.
The problem is that under the Montreal Protocol, which the U.S. has signed, hydrofluoro<mark>carbon</mark>s (HFCs) were promoted as the environmental alternative to ozone-depleting hydrochlorofluoro<mark>carbon</mark>s (HCFCs), which had become the standard working coolant in refrigerators, air conditioners and aerosol cans. HCFCs, for their part, originally replaced the even more potent ozone-depleting chlorofluoro<mark>carbon</mark>s (CFCs) that were used liberally until the early 1990s. Whereas HFCs do not destroy the ozone layer, they can be thousands of times <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-mechanism-of-hot-air"">more harmful to Earth's <mark>climate</mark></A> than <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, posing a significant threat should they become HCFCs' main replacement.&quot;HCFCs and HFCs are two chemicals designed by chemists to trap heat; the fluorinated part of the compound turns what would be a normal hydro<mark>carbon</mark> into something that is much more durable,&quot; explains Kert Davies, director of research for Greenpeace USA. &quot;When you combine those two properties—heat trapping and durability—in the atmosphere, it creates a <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/from-bad-to-worse-with-greenhouse-gas-emissions"">greenhouse gas</A>. We created another problem by replacing the ozone depleters with chemicals that cause global warming, and now we need to replace these because they are going to be banned.&quot;
Starting January 1, under the Montreal Protocol, the world's developed nations must cut <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/teflon-parts-could-cause"">HCFC consumption and production</A> by 75 percent. It will then become illegal to import, produce or sell Freon (HCFC-22) and HCFC-142b, the ubiquitous refrigerants, for use in new equipment. At the same time, Europe is implementing a ban on HFC-134a (a common car air-conditioning refrigerant that can trap 3,400 times more heat in the atmosphere than CO<SUB>2</SUB>), beginning in 2011.
The alternatives? Natural refrigerants and a new group of fluorochemicals called hydrofluoro-olefins (HFOs).
Naturally occurring refrigerants, such as hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s (propane, isobutane and cyclopentane), ammonia and even that <mark>climate</mark> culprit <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, can be used as cooling agents in refrigerators and air conditioners. They all have relatively low or lower global warming potentials, exist in large quantities, and do not have unknown side effects.
Ironically, CO<SUB>2</SUB> seems to rise above the rest. &quot;CO<SUB>2</SUB> is an excellent refrigerant with superior thermodynamic and transport properties, compared to the HFCs in use today,&quot; saysDavid Hinde, manager of research and development for Conyers, Ga.–based Hill Phoenix, which recently became the first company to receive EPA approval to replace HCFCs with CO<SUB>2</SUB> in supermarkets. &quot;By using CO<SUB>2</SUB>, refrigeration systems will be able to reduce HFC leaks as well as dramatically reduce the HFC charge (the amount used in a system).&quot;
Like most refrigerants, CO<SUB>2</SUB> can remove heat from the air. The process starts when a refrigerator's compressor condenses CO<SUB>2</SUB>, raising its pressure and temperature. The gas is then transferred to a gas cooler where the heat is released cooling the refrigerant, which casts off the heat from a radiator on the back or bottom of the fridge. The CO<SUB>2</SUB> (now between the liquid and vapor phases) then travels through an expansion valve, instantly reducing the liquid's pressure and causing it to rapidly expand into vapor. As the CO<SUB>2</SUB> evaporates it absorbs heat, thereby <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/solar-refrigeration"">cooling the air inside the refrigerator</A> compartment. CO<SUB>2</SUB> must be used at a much higher pressure than HFC refrigerants, and therefore requires stronger piping. 
Already, companies such as Coca-Cola have begun using CO<SUB>2</SUB> as a refrigerant in vending machines and other retail refrigerators outside of the U.S., as in <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/report.cfm?id=china"">China during the Olympics</A>. And PepsiCo is now testing these vending machines in Washington, D.C., including in the Capitol.
Another potential alternative is hydro<mark>carbon</mark>-based refrigerants, such as isobutane, which has been used in household refrigerators throughout Europe and in parts of Asia for a number of years. General Electric is currently seeking U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approval for its use in the U.S. Ben &amp; Jerry's, a division of Unilever, has applied to the EPA to use propane as a refrigerant in ice-cream freezers. Both requests are pending approval due to fears over combustibility.
Then there are the synthetic refrigerants. In response to the ban on HFC-134a in Europe, chemical industry giants DuPont and Honeywell combined their years of fluorochemical expertise to find an alternative. HFO-1234yf was their answer. It doesn't cause <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-ozone-depleting-ch"">ozone depletion</A>, has an extremely low global warming potential, and is predicted to be ready for commercial use midway through 2011.
Concerns have been raised, however, over possible toxic side effects to the employees working around these chemicals as well as for automobile owners should it ignite. DuPont acknowledges that though HFO-1234yf is flammable, it is no more hazardous than the chemical it is replacing.
As most of these alternatives await approval, the possibility of HFC proliferation hangs in the air. But, not if Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Environment Dan Reifsnyder has a say in the matter. Reifsnyder, as head of the U.S. delegation to the <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientists-identify-safe-limits-for-human-impacts"">Montreal Protocol</A>, along with Canada and Mexico, has proposed an amendment to the treaty, calling for an HFC phasedown.&quot;HFCs today are not yet in wide use and embedded in the world, but if you look out to 2050 without any action being taken, they will be where people go when they leave HCFCs,&quot; Reifsnyder says. &quot;The value of this proposal is it will send a signal to the private sector for the need for alternatives that are <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mending-ozone-good-for-global-warming"">benign in the ozone and <mark>climate</mark> sense</A>, and give the private sector time to work on new compounds.&quot;
The amendment to the protocol will be negotiated this week in Port Ghalib, Egypt, by the United Nations. If passed, it would mark the first time that language on a <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/limits-on-greenhouse-gas-emissions"">greenhouse gas</A> is incorporated into the ozone treaty. It would also mean the EPA could expand its mandate to regulate ozone-depleting substances to include a greenhouse gas, because it is the agency that implements the Montreal Protocol in the U.S.&quot;Before we end up with a big problem, let's avoid a big problem,&quot; Reifsnyder says.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""article-author-container""><H3 class=""article-author-container__title"">ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)</H3><SECTION class=""article-author""><DIV class=""article-author__main""><P class=""article-author__name t_body t_body--article"">Robynne Boyd</P><P class=""article-author__desc t_body t_body--article"">Robynne Boyd began writing about people and the planet when living barefoot and by campfire on the North Shore of Kauai, Hawaii.

AP4's aim to continue to de<mark>carbon</mark>izing its portfolio is dependent on good information from companies about their emissions and exposure to <mark>climate change</mark>.

It has relevance for businesses across every sector of the economy. A consistent and transparent flow of information on what global business is doing and the progress it is making is a crucial piece of the puzzle. As we continue to seek new ways to move beyond our legacy, and transport our assets into the future, data and disclosure on financial impacts will become ever more powerful tools in helping us to tackle <mark>climate change</mark>”.</P><P><STRONG>Isabelle Kocher, Chief Executive Officer, </STRONG><STRONG>ENGIE</STRONG><STRONG> Group:</STRONG></P><P>“In Engie’s view, active in 70 countries over the World, the TCFD recommendations for increased transparency from the industry and financial sectors on how <mark>climate</mark> risks are taken into account is of utmost importance.

Greater <mark>climate</mark> related financial disclosure in line with the TCFD’s four widely adoptable recommendations is crucial to secure more complete, meaningful, reliable and consistent data across all companies and sectors. Given their importance at the top of the investment supply chain, large asset owners and asset managers also recognise they have an important role to play in driving the swift and widespread adoption of this framework.“</P><P><STRONG>Philippe Desfosses, CEO of French pension fund ERAFP and Vice Chair of the Institutional Investors Group on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IIGCC):</STRONG></P><P>“The more companies report effectively on <mark>climate</mark> related risks and opportunities, the easier it becomes for investors to allocate the substantial amounts of capital required to implement the Paris Agreement and to work on their own <mark>climate</mark> risk disclosure. There should be no resistance to the widespread adoption on the TCFD’s recommendations given how – in most G20 countries – companies already have legal obligations to disclose material risks in their routine financial filings, including those that related to <mark>climate change</mark>. Moreover, with its remit now extended to 2018, the TCFD is well placed to monitor implementation and take-up of its framework closely.”</P><P><STRONG>Ian Simm, Chief Executive Officer, Impax Asset Management Group plc:</STRONG></P><P>“The rollout of the TCFD’s recommendations represents an important milestone in the international financial system’s internalisation of the emerging systemic risks of <mark>climate change</mark>. These recommendations are designed to offer companies and their investors a commercially actionable, voluntary framework to improve <mark>climate</mark>-related financial disclosures.</P><P>Reporting prepared in response to the recommendations should provide investors with a more complete understanding of the <mark>climate</mark> risks facing their individual holdings and across their portfolios, thereby encouraging better risk assessment in investment decision making.”</P><P><STRONG>Robin Hayes, President and Chief Executive Officer, JetBlue:</STRONG></P><P>“As a business, we must understand the true financial impact of <mark>climate change</mark>, and as an airline, we need to understand the conditions we will by flying with in the future. <mark>Climate</mark> risk disclosure – and the thinking that goes behind it – protects our customers, crewmembers, and shareholders. These new recommendations guide us on how to do just that.”</P><P><STRONG>Herve Guez, Global Head of Research &amp; Deputy CIO, Mirova:</STRONG></P><P>&quot;We applaud TCFD report. Better information about “the effects that <mark>climate change</mark> can have on companies’ day-to-day operation and long-term strategies is key. It should help investors to understand what companies and project contribute to reduce <mark>climate</mark> risks at a local and systemic level and drive their investment decisions.&quot; </P><P><STRONG>Gerald Cartigny, Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at Dutch pension manager MN:</STRONG></P><P>“The TCFD’s framework provides a good foundation for improving the ability of investors and others to appropriately assess and price <mark>climate</mark> related risk and opportunities. It is particularly valuable that one of the key disclosures recommended by TCFD is focused on the resilience of a company’s business strategy regarding <mark>climate</mark>-related risks, including a scenario designed to curb global average temperature rises to 2C Celsius or less. Such analysis is crucial for investors seeking decision-useful, <mark>climate</mark> related financial information.”</P><P><STRONG>Victoria Barron, Responsible Investment Analyst, Newton Investment Management:</STRONG></P><P>“The physical impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>, as well as the policy responses to it and technological opportunities arising from it are key considerations for long-term investors. As such, we need to understand how companies are prepared and aligned with a 2-degree world to best understand the related risks and opportunities for our investments. However, to date we have struggled because of patchy, unverified data, the absence of scenario analysis and a lack of material, investment relevant disclosure from business. As such, we welcome the TCFD's approach of encouraging material <mark>climate change</mark> disclosures that are presented in the context of a company's strategy and financials. This analysis will mean we can better factor this key issue into our investment analysis and stewardship of our clients’ assets.” </P><P><STRONG>Ron Mock, </STRONG><STRONG>President</STRONG><STRONG> and Chief Executive Officer, Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan:</STRONG></P><P>“The implications of <mark>climate change</mark> have a direct impact on the sustainability of the investments we are making today to help pay the pensions of future generations of teachers. The FSB Task Force recommendations are a meaningful step forward in providing the transparency, comparable and consistent information that we require as we navigate the transition to a low <mark>carbon</mark> economy.”</P><P><STRONG>Hugh O’Reilly, President and Chief Executive Officer, OPTrust:</STRONG></P><P>“We believe that the recommended framework should become the disclosure standard for <mark>climate change</mark> related risk. For pension funds, <mark>climate change</mark> presents complex and long-term risks. The work being done by the TCFD is critical in ensuring both increased awareness of <mark>climate change</mark> as a financial risk and proposes a reasonable framework for disclosure so that we can better understand and assess that risk.”</P><P><STRONG>Indra K. Nooyi, </STRONG><STRONG>Chairman</STRONG><STRONG> and Chief Executive Officer, <mark>PepsiCo Inc.</mark>:</STRONG></P><P>“<mark>Climate change</mark> is one of the most important issues of our time and requires immediate, coordinated action. For our global food and beverage company, reducing our <mark>carbon</mark> emissions is the right thing to do and it makes good business sense—driving down operating costs, creating efficiencies and ensuring that we continue to be welcomed into communities where we do business. That’s why PepsiCo has a science-based goal to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions across our value chain by at least 20% by 2030. We will continue to deliver on this goal while disclosing our progress and challenges over the coming years.”</P><P><STRONG>Else Bos, Chief Executive Officer, PGGM N.V.:</STRONG></P><P>“Institutional investors commit capital for the long term. Our investment decisions today help shape our economic and ecological wellbeing long into the future. <mark>Climate change</mark> is one of the largest challenges of our time. It has impact on the value of our investments and, conversely, our investment decisions impact the <mark>climate</mark>. In addition to risks, <mark>climate change</mark> creates enormous opportunities. The energy transition requires massive investments in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and storage. Transparency brings all actors in a better position to manage these risks and exploit the opportunities. The TCFD recommendations aim to achieve just that.”</P><P><STRONG>Feike Sijbesma, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board, Royal DSM:</STRONG></P><P>“DSM continues to stay committed to bold <mark>climate</mark> action: we need to invest for the future while making our businesses future proof. Now is the right time to ensure an accelerated but orderly transition to a low <mark>carbon</mark> economy. A well informed business-investor dialogue, as recommended by the FSB Taskforce, will surely help to facilitate this”.</P><P><STRONG>Ben van Beurden, Chief Executive Officer, Royal Dutch Shell plc:</STRONG></P><P>“I agree that companies should be clear about how they plan to be resilient in the face of <mark>climate change</mark> and energy transition. I believe it is right that it should be transparent which companies are truly on firm foundations over the long-term. I not only applaud the Task Force for its work to achieve this aim but I have signed a letter confirming Shell’s support for the initiative. The details matter and I look forward to Shell working with the Task Force on those details. Specifically, how we present forward-looking information in an uncertain world, the disclosure of commercially sensitive data and the feasibility of providing the suggested detail to the standard required of financial filings. Ultimately, however, both Shell and the Task Force want this plan to be fit for purpose.”</P><P><STRONG>Courtney Geduldig, Executive Vice President, Public Affairs, S&amp;P Global:</STRONG></P><P>“Sustainability-related risks can impact financial performance and value of companies.

Greater transparency around sustainability metrics is invaluable as investors further integrate these factors into their research, and can help institutions better protect against risks.

But robust incentives are required from governments. A set of specific measures should be implemented such as reduction or cancellation of customs tariffs for low-<mark>carbon</mark> or energy efficient equipment and technologies; tax preferences for companies introducing “green” technologies; and creation of a favourable investment environment through bank loans at reduced rates for introduction of ‘green’ technologies.”</P><P><STRONG>Graeme Pitkethly, Chief Financial Officer, Unilever:</STRONG></P><P>“It’s fundamental for every good business to manage and communicate risks and opportunities. We are already obliged to disclose material risk. <mark>Climate change</mark> is no different. It’s a risk that is already affecting companies today – both through the impacts of steadily rising global temperatures and through the policies that governments around the world adopt in response.</P><P>As part of the task force, we have put together a standardised framework for companies to disclose <mark>climate</mark>-related risks and opportunities, focusing on making them as practical as possible to adopt. Why? Because markets need information to operate efficiently. We have to be transparent to help investors make better decisions for the long term. And beyond the markets, we know that transparency is increasingly important to our consumers too. They want to know the values of the companies they are buying from, particularly millennials. The same goes for the young talented future leaders we all wish to recruit.</P><P>I’d urge all companies to read this report and adopt the recommendations.”</P></DIV></ARTICLE></SECTION></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

If Donald Trump asked the executives sitting on his business advisory council for advice about energy policy, what kind of answer would he get? </P><P>
Judging by the billions of dollars those executives are pouring into renewables and <mark>carbon</mark> reduction programs, they'd probably tell him to emphasize the clean stuff.</P><P>
In other words, the exact opposite of what <A href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/week-7-of-the-trump-presidency-the-podcast-edition"">he's doing now</A>. </P><P>
A GTM review finds that nearly every company represented on Trump's business advisory council is investing heavily in renewable energy projects and sustainability programs. The investments are wide-ranging. They include tax equity funds for solar and wind, direct renewable energy procurement to power facilities, deep energy efficiency to lower energy costs, and cleantech R&amp;D to stay ahead of the competition. </P><P>
Many of the executives or member companies have also made strong statements about the favorable economics of renewables and the imperative of addressing global warming.</P><P>
&quot;To make America great again, <mark>climate</mark> action is very logical. This is a very convincing story for job creation and economic growth,&quot; said Doug McMillon, Wal-Mart's chief executive and White House business council member, speaking at the World Economic Forum in January. </P><P>
In February, council member and Tesla CEO Elon Musk also <A href=""http://www.recode.net/2017/2/4/14508874/elon-musk-trump-business-council-twitter-tesla-spacex"" target=""_blank"">said he raised the issue of <mark>climate change</mark></A> during a meeting with the president.</P><P>
Judging by the administration's systematic dismantling of environmental and <mark>climate</mark> regulations, Trump <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/<mark>climate</mark>/donald-trump-global-warming-views.html"" target=""_blank"">hasn't taken</A> any of those comments seriously. But he cares deeply about what business leaders think -- and what they think of him. And nearly every company on his advisory team has enthusiastically embraced a strategy to address <mark>climate</mark>. </P><P>
It's <A href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/ivanka-trump-<mark>climate</mark>-czar-232031"" target=""_blank"">not just Ivanka</A> who has the chance to whisper in the president's ear about clean energy. It's also the most powerful CEOs in the world. </P><H2>
Blackstone: Investing in gigawatts of solar and wind<P>
Blackstone Group is one of the largest private equity companies in the world, specializing in real estate, corporate buyouts and hedge funds. CEO Stephen Schwarzman is chairman of the council, and reportedly <A href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/02/trump-to-meet-frequently-with-blackstones-schwarzman-other-business-titans-to-discuss-policy.html"" target=""_blank"">recruited</A> the other members. </P><P>
Blackstone is very active in renewables. In 2014, it founded Onyx Renewable Partners, a developer of smaller utility-scale wind and solar projects with 1 gigawatt of projects completed or planned in North America.  </P><P>
In 2012, Blackstone crafted a program to help its portfolio companies invest directly in solar to &quot;focus on sustainability across the firm for companies it manages and advises&quot; and cut their costs 10 percent.</P><P>
Also in 2012, the firm acquired the up-and-coming U.S. residential PV installer Vivint Solar for $1.9 billion -- eventually selling the company to SunEdison for $2.2 billion three years later. It has also provided financing for transmission and wind projects.</P><P>
Here's an excerpt from <A href=""https://www.blackrock.com/investing/literature/whitepaper/bii-<mark>climate</mark>-change-2016-us.pdf"" target=""_blank"">a 2016 report</A> on adapting investment portfolios to <mark>climate change</mark>: &quot;Investors can no longer ignore <mark>climate change</mark>. Some may question the science behind it, but all are faced with a swelling tide of <mark>climate</mark>-related regulations and technological disruption. We believe all investors should incorporate <mark>climate change</mark> awareness into their investment processes.&quot;</P></H2><H2>
BlackRock: Managing a $970M fund in clean energy technologies<P>
BlackRock CEO and Chairman Larry Fink sits on Trump's council. His investment firm, which manages $5 trillion in assets, has gone all-in on the energy transition, setting up <A href=""https://www.blackrock.com/hk/en/products/229299/blackrock-new-energy-fund-a2-usd"" target=""_blank"">a &quot;new energy&quot; fund</A> currently worth $970 million that focuses on renewable energy technology, renewables developers, alternative fuels, efficiency and energy infrastructure. It also raised €650 million for a European renewable energy investment fund in August of 2016. </P><P>
Just this week, BlackRock said it would start assessing <mark>climate</mark> risks of portfolio companies. &quot;They're probably not moving fast enough given the risks to the business,&quot; <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackrock-<mark>climate</mark>-exclusive-idUSKBN16K0CR"" target=""_blank"">according to the leader of the risk assessment team</A>.</P><P>
The firm also developed internal energy-efficiency targets, and claims to have cut energy consumption by 11 percent per employee since 2012.</P><P>
David Giordano, managing director and member of the Renewable Power Group, said <A href=""https://www.blackrock.com/institutions/en-axj/insights/the-mainstreaming-of-renewable-power"" target=""_blank"">in an interview</A> about renewables: &quot;We continue to see growth. Year-over-year, this has been half of the new generation put onto the grid. And so the opportunities to invest will only increase.&quot;</P></H2><H2>
Boeing: Researching everything from high-efficiency solar to biofuels<P>
Advisory council member Jim McNerney served as Boeing's CEO for a decade. Under his tenure, Boeing ramped up internal renewable energy goals and airplane redesign efforts to improve fuel efficiency. It also invested in new biofuels and a reversible fuel-cell technology, and continued work on high-efficiency solar cells <A href=""http://www.spectrolab.com/"" target=""_blank"">at its Spectrolab</A>.</P><P>
The world's biggest aerospace company developed a demonstration airplane in 2015 to test more than a dozen new technologies designed to lower <mark>carbon</mark> emissions per flight. The company says its 787 Dreamliner cuts <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions by one-quarter compared to older models</P><P>
According to a 2014 sustainability report, Boeing gets 13 percent of its electricity from wind, solar and biomass. It gets another 39 percent from hydro and 13 percent from nuclear. </P><P>
McNerney's <A href=""http://www.boeing.com/aboutus/environment/environmental_report_09/ceo-and-leadership-messages.html"" target=""_blank"">letter to shareholders</A> in 2009 described Boeing's early commitment to <mark>climate</mark> action: &quot;This holistic approach recognizes that energy and environmental issues are tightly intertwined. The challenge of environmental improvement demands that we harness diverse energy sources while improving overall efficiency to reduce <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions in the most beneficial and effective ways.&quot;</P></H2><H2>
Boston Consulting Group: Paying attention to the 'disruptive force' of distributed energy<P>
Rich Lesser, CEO of the Boston Consulting Group, sits on the council. His mega-consulting firm has developed a robust consulting practice around energy, renewables and sustainability. The firm has written extensively about the disruptive nature of the clean energy transition.</P><P>
From <A href=""https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/energy_environment_distributed_energy_disruptive_force/?chapter=8#chapter8"" target=""_blank"">a report</A> on how distributed, localized energy will shake up power markets: &quot;Distributive energy is a disruptive force. It will require an equally big disruption among utilities if they are going to survive and grow in the changing U.S. power environment.&quot;</P></H2><H2>
Cleveland Clinic: Sustainability is a 'concrete imperative'<P>
Toby Cosgrove, president and CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, is a member of the council. Over his 13 years as the CEO of one of America's biggest hospitals, he has increasingly emphasized sustainability practices.</P><P>
In 2008, Cleveland Clinic became the first healthcare company to sign a U.N. global compact that calls for businesses to implement &quot;environmentally responsible principles.&quot; In 2011, Cosgrove unveiled a plan to cut energy use 20 percent by 2020 and reform its medical waste management policies. The clinic also invested in a 100-kilowatt solar system.</P><P>
In a 2012 op-ed published on LinkedIn, Cosgrove <A href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20121128192625-205372152-what-is-sustainability-in-healthcare"" target=""_blank"">detailed his passion</A> for sustainability: &quot;Some may consider 'sustainability' to be little more than a popular buzzword, but for those of us in healthcare, it’s a concrete imperative. Either we establish American healthcare on an environmentally, socially and economically <mark>sustainable</mark> basis, or we resign ourselves to a system of 'sick care' that serves neither patients nor communities.&quot;</P></H2><H2>
Ernst &amp; Young: Watching the global clean energy race closely<P>
Mark Weinberger, chairman and CEO of Ernst &amp; Young, is a council member. His 230,000-person firm provides consulting services, tax services and professional development services. It has also become a go-to resource for tracking the global clean energy race. </P><P>
Ernst &amp; Young regularly publishes the attractiveness index for renewables that monitors the latest policy and business activity in the sector, and then grades each region. (It <A href=""http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-RECAI-48-October-2016-index-at-a-glance/$FILE/EY-RECAI-48-October-2016-index-at-a-glance.pdf"" target=""_blank"">recently warned</A> of a possible downgrade for America because &quot;Donald Trump has a poor record on <mark>climate change</mark>, which he has frequently dismissed as a 'hoax,' and threatens to pick apart the Paris <mark>climate</mark> accord should he be elected.&quot;)</P><P>
Along with building out a large sustainability practice, Ernst &amp; Young set a goal to reduce its U.S. emissions 12 percent by 2020.</P><P>
From <A href=""http://www.ey.com/gl/en/industries/power---utilities/ey-renewable-energy-country-attractiveness-index-feb-2016"" target=""_blank"">a 2016 issue</A> of its attractiveness index: &quot;Never before have the opportunities been so vast, with the transition to a world of subsidy-free renewables creating new horizons for <mark>innovation</mark>, economies of scale and value chain integration, as well as opening up new markets globally.&quot;</P></H2><H2>
General Electric: Investing $1B each year into renewables<P>
GE is the poster child for energy <mark>innovation</mark>. For the last decade, the company has plowed billions into renewable energy projects, wind turbine design, energy analytics, efficient engines, and pretty much anything else that could upend the energy sector. The company also has an internal coal of slashing greenhouse gas emissions 20 percent by 2020.</P><P>
Jack Welch, the CEO of GE for 20 years through 2001 who sits on the advisory council, is probably the least interested in <mark>climate change</mark>. While he says he doesn't deny the problem, he once called Obama's <mark>climate</mark> plan &quot;<A href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/02/jack-welch-says-obamas-wacky-<mark>climate</mark>-change-agenda-hurts-the-us-economy.html"" target=""_blank"">wacky.</A>&quot;</P><P>
Current CEO Jeff Immelt is much more progressive on <mark>climate</mark>. He recently talked up clean energy investments <A href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/03/cnbc-exclusive-cnbc-transcript-ge-chairman-ceo-jeff-immelt-interview-with-cnbcs-jim-cramer-on-mad-money-wednesday-december-2nd.html"" target=""_blank"">with Jim Cramer</A> on CNBC: &quot;We've been working on this for a decade, a decade. Long before it was cool, we were investing in clean energy, revenue growth in technologies. We have more than $25 billion of annual revenue that is really in clean tech, if you will, high-efficiency engines, wind turbines, energy efficiency. So, we are as well placed from a diversity and technical depth standpoint as anybody in the world to be able to participate as in this clean energy future.&quot;</P></H2><H2>
General Motors: 100% renewable energy by 2050<P>
Mary Barra, CEO and chairman of GM, is a member of the council. GM isn't just focused on the future of electric vehicles and autonomy. It is playing hard in the renewables game too.</P><P>
Last fall, Barra announced that the company would get 100 percent of its energy from renewables by 2050. In 2015, the automaker sourced 9 terawatt-hours of electricity from 22 solar arrays, three landfill gas sites and four wind projects. GM says it saves $5 million annually from using renewables and has saved $80 million over the last two decades. </P><P>
Mary Barra <A href=""https://www.gm.com/mol/m-2016-sep-0914-renewable-energy.html"" target=""_blank"">on GM's 100 percent renewables goal</A>: “Establishing a 100 percent renewable energy goal helps us better serve society by reducing environmental impact. This pursuit of renewable energy benefits our customers and communities through cleaner air while strengthening our business through lower and more stable energy costs.”</P></H2><H2>
Global Infrastructure Partners: Hundreds of megawatts of solar and offshore wind<P>
Global Infrastructure Partners Chairman Adebayo Ogunlesi sits on the council, to which he brings significant expertise on infrastructure. That expertise also includes renewables. </P><P>
GIP has invested in numerous wind and solar projects around the world, including a 50 percent stake in a 330-megawatt offshore wind farm in Germany and large stakes in a portfolio of 1,100 megawatts of wind and solar projects in Spain, Portugal, Mexico, Uruguay and Peru.</P><P>
Ogunlesi commented on the investment: &quot;This is an outstanding opportunity to combine the world-class industrial and renewable energy development experience of ACS with GIP's renewable energy sector expertise and business model of value-added infrastructure investment.&quot;</P></H2><H2>
Hoover Institution: Thought leadership on a <mark>carbon</mark> tax<P>
Advisory board member Kevin Warsh is a fellow at the Hoover Institution, a policy and economics think tank based out of Stanford. The Hoover Institute <A href=""http://www.hoover.org/research/energy-science-technology"" target=""_blank"">regularly posts analysis and articles</A> about <mark>carbon</mark> taxes, espoused by Hoover Fellow George Shultz. </P><P>
Shultz, who was secretary of state under Reagan and secretary of treasury under Nixon, has made <mark>carbon</mark> taxes a central part of his policy platform while at the Hoover Institution. He's also a member of the <mark>Climate</mark> Leadership Council, made up of distinguished conservatives who want to price <mark>carbon</mark>.</P><P>
From the <mark>Climate</mark> Leadership Council's <A href=""https://www.clcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TheConservativeCasefor<mark>Carbon</mark>Dividends.pdf"" target=""_blank"">conservative case for <mark>carbon</mark> dividends</A>: &quot;Now that the Republican Party controls the White House and Congress, it has the opportunity and responsibility to promote a <mark>climate</mark> plan that showcases the full power of enduring conservative convictions.&quot;</P></H2><H2>
IBM: Using the internet of things to cut <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> from buildings and the grid<P>
Council member Ginni Rometty is the CEO and chairman of IBM. Her company oversees some of the most <A href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/the-electric-industry-prepares-for-a-renewable-energy-dominant-grid"">sophisticated analytics platforms</A> designed to integrate more distributed renewables on the grid, forecast energy system conditions, and make buildings run more efficiently in real time.</P><P>
IBM has also set strong internal targets for renewables and efficiency. It plans to sign contracts for renewable energy projects that will supply 20 percent of its annual consumption by 2020. As part of IBM's early efficiency efforts, the computer tech company slashed <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by 4.3 million metric tons -- saving $579 million in energy costs between 1990 and 2015.</P><P>
IBM often touts <A href=""https://www.ibm.com/blogs/internet-of-things/connected-world-<mark>sustainable</mark>-planet/"" target=""_blank"">the use of analytics</A> to help reduce <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide: &quot;The internet of things...is changing the approach to a <mark>sustainable</mark> environment. It is reducing <mark>carbon</mark> footprints and <mark>pollution</mark>; enabling us to do more with fewer resources; improving food security; mitigating the adverse impacts of weather and <mark>climate change</mark>; and changing our behavior based on what our environment and connected world is telling us. [...] The actions you take to better the environment can help you reduce cost, build brand loyalty, attract talent, provide a healthier work environment, and stimulate new thinking and <mark>innovation</mark>.&quot;</P></H2><H2>
IHS Markit: '<mark>Climate change</mark> and energy security are converging as the new engine'<P>
Council member Daniel Yergin is one of the most highly respected experts in energy. In 2010, his business analysis firm IHS Markit acquired Emerging Energy Research in order to focus more on the clean energy space.</P><P>
Yergin is an expert in oil and gas, but has also talked extensively about the clean energy transition. In 2008, <A href=""http://news.ihsmarkit.com/press-release/energy/yergin-<mark>climate</mark>-change-and-energy-are-converging-new-era-clean-energy"" target=""_blank"">he talked</A> about the &quot;major shift in public opinion toward clean energy, which is being bolstered by the growing conviction that new <mark>carbon</mark> policies will reshape the competitive landscape of the global energy business.”</P><P>
Yergin <A href=""http://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/At-CERAWeek-forces-of-change-expected-to-10977001.php"" target=""_blank"">continues to highlight</A> the disruptive impact of new methods of fossil fuel extraction, the falling cost of renewables, and the impact of <mark>climate change</mark>: &quot;There's probably never been a time when there [are] this many different forces of change buffeting the energy industry. It leads to questions of uncertainty about what the energy industry is going to look like in the future.&quot;</P></H2><H2>
JPMorgan Chase: One of the biggest tax equity investors in solar<P>
Jamie Dimon, president and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, was tapped for the council after calling Trump's win a &quot;<A href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/20/jamie-dimon-trump-presidency-is-a-moment-of-opportunity.html"" target=""_blank"">moment of opportunity</A>&quot; for economic growth.</P><P>
JPMorgan has seized numerous economic opportunities in renewables, becoming one of the biggest tax equity investors in solar over the last decade. In 2015 alone, the bank invested $2 billion in tax equity for solar projects. The firm has also installed 1 megawatt of solar on its buildings and renovated its New York headquarters to make the facility LEED Platinum certified. </P><P>
Over the last four years, JP Morgan <A href=""https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/Corporate-Responsibility/document/jpm-<mark>sustainable</mark>-finance-brochure-final.pdf"" target=""_blank"">has underwritten</A> $11 billion in &quot;environmentally beneficial&quot; projects, and committed or arranged more than $12 billion in capital for solar, wind and geothermal projects.</P><P>
Dimon wrote about environmental performance in JPMorgan's corporate sustainability report: &quot;Effectively addressing environmental, social and governance issues is a key part of building a great company. Doing so means having strong governance, effective risk management systems and robust controls.&quot;</P></H2><H2>
Pepsi: 'Future-Proofing' the Company Through Sustainability Measures<P>
Indra Nooyi, chairman and chief executive of PepsiCo, supported Hillary Clinton. But she joined Trump's council anyway.</P><P>
In a 2015 sustainability report, Pepsi outlined a plan for &quot;shifting to renewables&quot; in order to help slash greenhouse gas emissions 20 percent by 2030. The company has also re-evaluated its entire supply chain in order to squeeze out energy costs and monitor the sourcing of its products. </P><P>
Nooyi has been outspoken about the urgent need to address <mark>climate change</mark>: &quot;Combating <mark>climate change</mark> is absolutely critical to the future of our company, customers, consumers -- and our world. I believe all of us need to take action now. PepsiCo has already taken actions in our operations and throughout our supply chain to 'future-proof' our company -- all of which deliver real cost savings, mitigate risk, protect our license to operate, and create resilience in our supply chain.&quot;</P></H2><H2>
Tesla: The world's first fully integrated solar, EV and battery storage company <P>
Tesla CEO Elon Musk was heavily criticized for his role on the advisory council. But he has <A href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-trump-advisory-council-2017-2"" target=""_blank"">weathered the storm</A>. </P><P>
Musk is trying to revolutionize electric cars, solar and batteries -- all while making humans a multiplanetary species. He also believes <mark>climate change</mark> is an existential threat. </P><P>
There's no other executive on the council who's as committed to the clean energy transition. And Musk is the one so far who has explicitly said he'll try to talk to the president about <mark>climate change</mark>.</P></H2><H2>
Wal-Mart: America's leader in corporate solar projects<P>
Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon sits on the council. His company was one of the first mega-retailers to go all-in on sustainability. (Even before that, the Walton family was an early investor in global solar developer First Solar.)</P><P>
Since 2005, Wal-Mart has become the leading corporate investor in on-site solar, now getting 25 percent of its electricity from renewables. The retailer also doubled the fuel efficiency of its trucking fleet over a decade, saving $1 billion in the 2015 fiscal year.</P><P>
Last year, McMillon <A href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/15/<mark>climate</mark>-change-walmart-business-leadership-commentary.html"" target=""_blank"">called for an additional</A> 18 percent emissions reduction across the company's stores and trucking fleets, and increased its renewable energy commitment to 50 percent by 2025. </P><P>
McMillon explained his commitment in Trump terms: &quot;To make America great again, <mark>climate</mark> action is very logical. This is a very convincing story for job creation and economic growth.&quot;</P></H2><H2>
Walt Disney Company: 50% <mark>carbon</mark> emissions cut by 2020<P>
Disney CEO Bob Iger didn't make it to the first business council meeting. But he's made it a priority to support more renewable energy deals -- including a 5-megawatt solar array <A href=""http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/brinkmann-on-business/os-disney-duke-solar-20160412-story.html"" target=""_blank"">shaped like Mickey Mouse</A>.</P><P>
Disney recently <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/bcause/american-business-act-on-<mark>climate</mark>-pledge"" target=""_blank"">signed a pledge</A> to increase its <mark>climate</mark> action commitments. By 2020, the entertainment giant plans to reduce emissions 50 percent, divert 60 percent of its waste from landfills and implement strict water conservation measures.</P><P>
In 2009, Iger talked about crafting a sustainability plan: “It’s essential to take swift action to preserve our most vulnerable natural environments for future generations and to be innovative in achieving that goal,”</P><P>
Also from Disney's <A href=""https://ditm-twdc-us.storage.googleapis.com/envirogoalsandtargets.pdf"" target=""_blank"">environmental reporting</A>: &quot;Environmental stewardship is a pillar of Disney’s vision to be the most admired company in the world. As part of the mission to conduct our business and create our products in an ethical manner, our commitment to environmental stewardship focuses on using resources wisely and protecting the planet as we operate and grow our business.&quot;</P><P>
Trump doesn't have to travel around the country to see the economic impact of renewables -- it's sitting all around him at his executive roundtables.</P><P><EM>GTM Research Solar Analyst Colin Smith contributed to this story.</EM></P></H2></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

This limitation makes it very time-consuming and expensive for an organization to quantify possible positive or negative environmental impacts. </P><P>The new methodology, outlined in the <A href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00463.x/abstract"">October 2012 issue of Journal of Industrial Ecology</A>, could greatly reduce the cost and effort associated with <mark>carbon</mark> footprinting, a measurement of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by an entity. The tool is designed to generate <A href=""http://engineering.columbia.edu/columbia-engineers-mine-big-data-faster-assess-<mark>carbon</mark>-footprints-0"">estimated emission factors</A> for materials, thereby eliminating the time and expertise required to manually map a product’s ingredients and packaging materials to LCA databases.</P><P>“Often, but not always, high GHG emissions in supply chain materials and internal operations correlate with high cost, inefficiency, and exposure to fossil fuel prices. Therefore, determining GHG emissions can often point to potential not only for reducing <mark>carbon</mark> but also overall cost, supply chain inefficiencies, and price risk,” said Dr. Christoph Meinrenken, the study’s lead author and an Associate Research Scientist with the Earth Institute and adjunct professor in Columbia Engineering. “And even in situations where this correlation is not present (or where indeed lowering emissions would mean higher costs) at least knowing the effect on GHG emissions means that executives do not have to make those difficult decisions blindly,” he added.</P><P>Rather than blindly reducing its overall <mark>pollution</mark>, a company can use this software to identify concrete areas of improvement. “For example, if a company were to consider replacing oil in their snacks with another alternative (say from another supplier), there is a long list of implications: GHG emissions and costs from growing and processing the oil, energies for ‘baking’ the affected snacks (again GHG and cost), shipping distances (GHG and costs), possibly health implications. Because the LCA tool, by its very nature, traces in microscopic detail which products, brands, factories, and logistics would be affected by the considered oil replacement, it has the potential to offer the company’s marketing, brand, and financial managers a rich amount of actionable information to support their decisions,” said Meinrenken. </P><P>Started in 2007, the project’s original objective was to evaluate and to standardize PepsiCo’s calculations of the amount of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emitted as a product moves through the supply chain. Meinrenken and his team applied the innovative life cycle analysis tool to a database of <A href=""http://earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/3011"">1,137 PepsiCo products</A> to estimate <mark>carbon</mark> footprints and to assess resource constraints.  The underlying algorithm is compliant with the <A href=""http://www.wri.org/"">World Resources Institute’s</A>“accounting rules” for bottom-up, full life cycle product <mark>carbon</mark> footprinting.</P><P>“The newly developed software promises to not only save time and money for companies like PepsiCo, but also to provide fresh insights into how companies measure, manage, and reduce their <mark>carbon</mark> footprint in the future,”<A href=""http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Researchers_develop_rapid_method_to_measure_<mark>carbon</mark>_footprints_999.html"">said Al Halvorsen</A>, Senior Director of Sustainability at PepsiCo. </P><P>Though the methodology is not based on any specific models previously used for <mark>carbon</mark> footprinting, it does share systematic similarities with a few savvy social media platforms. “The facebook and netflix inspiration refers to the general idea of mining ‘big-data’ to arrive at meaningful conclusions (whether that’s a conclusion about what movie a person may like, a possible romantic or ‘friend’ match, or how much <mark>carbon</mark> is emitted during manufacturing and use of a car), said Meinrenken. “One specific application of this general idea in our methodology is that we use statistical algorithms to predict the so called ‘<mark>carbon</mark> emissions’ (i.e., combined emissions of all GHG) of all the individual raw or intermediary materials that are used in manufactured goods such as orange juice, laptop computers, or a pair of jeans.”</P><P>The speedy software does make some trade-offs, as the <A href=""http://www.eenews.net/<mark>climate</mark>wire/2012/09/18/archive/3?terms=meinrenken"">margin of error</A> on an output can be +/- 20 percentage points. Meinrenken and his team are actively looking for new corporate partners who can pilot the software. “Having more real life data will help to us to further fine-tune some of the statistical algorithms and calibrations and extend the automated LCA approach from GHG to other environmental impacts such as e.g. water,” he remarked. </P><P>As organizations in the public, private, and governmental sectors seek to reduce their environmental impact, they rely on cost efficient and easy-to-use methods to make assessments. This new LCA is one such tool that can enable companies to better understand the environmental impacts associated with their products, processes, and activities. Ultimately, “the tool cannot make the decisions – as these remain multi-dimensional judgment calls where different, sometimes contradictory aspects and trade-offs have to be balanced,” admitted Meinrenken. “But companies prefer this over having to make these judgments calls without all information on the table.”</P><P>Interested in learning more?

Working together, the global agricultural community has the opportunity to leverage its resources to mitigate the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> while still meeting the food needs of our growing planet.”</P><P>Under the banner of the World Business Council for <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development’s (WBCSD) <A href=""http://lctpi.wbcsdservers.org/"" target=""_blank"">Low <mark>Carbon</mark> Technology Partnerships initiative (LCTPi)</A>, <mark>Climate</mark> Smart Agriculture focuses on three pillars: productivity, resilience and emissions reductions. </P><P>“Today, 1 in 8 people suffer from chronic hunger and more than 1 billion people are undernourished. Ensuring food security for the growing population of the world will require at least 50 percent more food to be made available by 2050 to feed 9 billion people.

And while large-scale farmers and processors such as ourselves are already putting CSA measures in place, it is the world’s millions of smallholders providing our daily coffee, cotton and chocolate fix that we have to reach, teach and support. We urge the agri industry and their customers to unite behind the WBSCD CSA framework to help scale the understanding and adoption of <mark>climate</mark> smart practices by rural communities” said Sunny Verghese, CEO of Olam.</P><P><mark>Climate</mark> Smart Agriculture has the support of key organisations such as the World Bank, the United Nations and FAO in addition to many national government aid and development agencies.</P><P>“We are focused on helping to improve the livelihoods of farming families and communities who grow our ingredients,” said John Bryant, Chairman and CEO of Kellogg Company. “Our <mark>Climate</mark> Smart Agriculture efforts aim to increase productivity and resiliency to help farmers produce more using fewer natural resources.”</P><P>Working under the strategic and scientific guidance of the CGIAR’s <mark>Climate Change</mark> Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) programme, the working group has identified priority actions that support smallholder farmers and bring prosperity through long-term relationships based on fairness, trust, women’s empowerment and the transfer of skills and knowledge.</P><P>“As researchers we plan to help companies set and meet meaningful targets – not just for emissions reductions, but also for smallholders’ standard of living,” said Dr. Sonja Vermuelen, head of research for CGIAR CCAFS program.</P><P>Importantly, the CSA working group will take responsibility for reporting their achievements, including under the <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development Goals. </P><P>Drawing on the expertise of the global agricultural community, the CSA working group has engaged a range of farming, NGO, research and agri-business organizations through regional dialogues in South Africa, Ghana, India, the USA, Brazil and Europe to develop the action plan for CSA.</P><P>The CSA working group is comprised of PepsiCo, Monsanto, Olam, Kellogg Company, Starbucks, Diageo, Coca-Cola, Yara International, Tyson Foods, Walmart, Du Pont, Banamex, Unilever, PwC and Novozymes.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

                                         , create an astounding 264 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions every year — as much as 69 coal-fired power plants. If these “Big 10” were a country, it would be the 25th biggest polluter on the planet, spewing more emissions than oil and gas producers Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.</P><P>The emissions these companies cause are contributing to a growing humanitarian catastrophe. By 2050, there could be 50 million more people made hungry because of <mark>climate change</mark>. More frequent, unpredictable and extreme storms, floods, droughts and shifting weather patterns are affecting food supplies, driving up food prices and causing more hunger and poverty.</P><P>These disruptions are bad news for both food companies and their investors. Unilever says it now loses $415 million per year due to extreme weather events such as flooding and extreme cold. In March of this year, General Mills’ CEO Ken Powell said that in the previous quarter, extreme weather had dampened sales and cost his company 62 days of production, “which hasn’t happened in a long time to us, think decades.”</P><P>These types of losses could just be the tip of the iceberg. Oxfam’s projections show that the price we pay for cereal brands like Kellogg’s Corn Flakes and General Mills’ Kix could spike by as much as 30% in the next 15 years because of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>The good news for the “Big 10” food companies is that they are immensely powerful players in the sector, with the influence to drive serious emissions reductions using existing tools and technologies. Oxfam’s report showed that if these 10 companies replicated the best practice in the industry, they could cut a further 80 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 — equivalent to taking all of the cars in Los Angeles, Beijing, London and New York off the road. </P><P>Some companies are already on the right path to reducing emissions and disclosing their progress. Unilever, Nestle and Coca-Cola are leading the pack, though even they have a ways to go. Yet too many companies are standing by silently, hoping the crisis will solve itself. Kellogg and General Mills stand out as among the worst of the “Big 10” in this regard.</P><P>More than half of the greenhouse gas emissions caused by big food companies comes from their supply chains. Yet General Mills and Kellogg don’t even have targets to cut supply-chain emissions. They do little to ensure that their suppliers are growing ingredients responsibly and reducing emissions. Even though these companies spend tens of millions of dollars to influence government policies on issues from food safety to nutrition standards, they stand by silently as fossil-fuel companies lobby to prevent ambitious <mark>climate</mark> action.</P><P>That’s where investors and consumers come into the picture. These two groups have a great deal to lose if the food industry continues to drag its feet in response to the real and present dangers posed by <mark>climate change</mark>. They also have significant sway over how companies operate. If consumers and investors speak out and urge the food industry to be a part of the solution to <mark>climate change</mark>, companies will have no choice but to listen.</P><P>Already many large investors and more than 239,000 people have joined Oxfam to call for more ambitious <mark>climate</mark> action from the food industry. The time has come for Big Food to step up.</P><P><EM>Raymond C. Offenheiser is the president of Oxfam America.

Alan Murray, Time Inc.’s Chief Content Officer, noted that it is far more common for the heads of huge companies to wade into controversial cultural and political topics—from <mark>climate change</mark> to nationwide protests—today than it was the case 10 or 15 years ago.</P><P>According to Nooyi, one factor is a changing workforce, which is now heavily populated with millennial workers who want their employers to embrace social issues. “They no longer look at is as [just] a paycheck,” she said. “They look at it as ‘How can I go to work and make a difference in society?'” The Pepsi CEO said that part of a chief executive’s duty today is to ensure that a company’s business goals align with initiatives that make a positive difference in the world. “We had to weave purpose into the core business model of the company,” Nooyi said. </P><P>And yet Nooyi also said she believes it can be problematic when a CEO takes a specific moral stance on an individual issue. “The best thing is to focus on running the company, do not take positions, and just make sure that you focus on your community,” she said. Murray noted that Nooyi was among the business leaders who recently <A href=""http://fortune.com/2017/08/17/donald-trump-ceo-council-disband-decision/"">pulled out</A> of President Donald Trump’s business advisory council in response to the president’s actions following racially-charged violence in Virginia last month.

Any message coming out of a company can be instantly dissected on a large social platform, which affects how the company is perceived by the public as well as its employees.</P><P>“All of our employees—who nowadays look for people, planet, then profits—have this broader view of how the world works and how we fit within it,” he said. “And, they’re influenced by many different factors out there.

The report, called <A href=""/publication/securing-rights-combating-<mark>climate</mark>-change""><STRONG>“Securing Rights, Combating <mark>Climate Change</mark>: How Strengthening Community Forest Rights Mitigates <mark>Climate Change</mark>,”</STRONG></A> is being published jointly by <STRONG>World Resources Institute (WRI)</STRONG> and <STRONG>Rights and Resources Initiative (RRI)</STRONG>. The paper provides the most comprehensive analysis to date linking legal recognition and government protection of community forest rights with reductions in <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark>.</P><P>“This golden opportunity to address <mark>climate change</mark> is staring us right in the face. With at least 37 billion tonnes of <mark>carbon</mark> safely stored in community forests around the world, strengthening community rights is good for the <mark>climate</mark> and good for people,” said <STRONG><A href=""/profile/andrew-steer"">Dr. Andrew Steer</A>, President &amp; CEO, WRI</STRONG>. “Every head of government, minister and <mark>climate</mark> negotiator should pay attention to this important, if often overlooked strategy to address <mark>climate change</mark>. It’s an approach to <mark>climate</mark> action that should be right up there with REDD+ or increasing energy efficiency.”</P><P>The report finds that rural communities and indigenous peoples across the world have government-recognized rights to forests containing 37.7 billion tonnes of <mark>carbon</mark>—equivalent to 29 times the annual emissions from all passenger vehicles in the world. In total, deforestation and other land uses represents 11 percent of global <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions.</P><P>Using new high-resolution mapping data, the authors analyzed 14 heavily-forested countries, including Brazil, Indonesia and Colombia and found that when governments enhanced and enforced forest rights, communities were more successful at stopping loggers, extractive companies, and settlers from illegally destroying the forests and releasing <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> into the atmosphere.</P><P>In Brazil alone, the report finds, strong legal rights could contribute to preventing 27.2 million hectares of deforestation by 2050, translating to 12 billion tonnes of avoided <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions—the same as about three years’ worth of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions from all Latin American and Caribbean countries.</P><P>Indeed, the study reveals that deforestation rates inside community forests are dramatically lower than in forests outside those areas. For example:</P><UL><LI>In a part of the Mexican Yucatán, it is 350 times lower;   </LI><LI>In the Guatemalan Petén, it is 20 times lower;  </LI><LI>In the Brazilian Amazon, it is 11 times lower; and  </LI><LI>In the Bolivian Amazon, it is 6 times lower. </LI></UL><P>“No one has a stronger interest in the health of forests than the communities that depend on them for their livelihoods and culture,” said <STRONG>Andy White, Coordinator of RRI</STRONG>. “Research has shown time and time again that clear and secure property rights for indigenous peoples and local communities have greatly boosted the capacity of countries to achieve national-level forest protection and restoration. It’s tragic that this has not yet been fully adopted as a central <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation strategy. For us to get serious about curbing <mark>climate change</mark>, we have to get serious about respecting the rights of local communities to the lands they live and depend on.”</P><P>The analysis finds that governments can implement five key recommendations to maximize the <mark>climate</mark> mitigation potential from community forests:</P><OL><LI>Provide communities with legal recognition of rights to their forest;  </LI><LI>Enforce community forest rights such as mapping boundaries and expelling trespassers;  </LI><LI>Provide technical assistance and training to forest communities to improve <mark>sustainable</mark> forest use and market access;  </LI><LI>Engage forest communities in decision-making on investments affecting their forest; and  </LI><LI>Compensate communities for the <mark>climate</mark> and other benefits provided by their forest.  </LI></OL><P>“The bottom line is clear: Strengthening community forest rights is a critical policy approach to mitigate global <mark>climate change</mark> through reduced deforestation and <mark>carbon</mark> sequestration,” said <STRONG><A href=""/profile/jennifer-morgan"">Jennifer Morgan</A>, Director, <mark>Climate</mark> and Energy Program, WRI</STRONG>. “When it comes to tackling <mark>climate change</mark>, land rights must be on the list of tools we use.”</P><P>The report notes that some countries have made significant progress in recognizing the rights of local communities and some REDD+ initiatives are beginning to support this trend. But in addition to pointing to countries that have enjoyed the <mark>climate</mark> benefits from enforcing community forest rights, the report offers a cautionary note to governments that undermine those rights. Indonesia, for example, the world’s second largest emitter of <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> from deforestation and other land uses, legally recognizes only one of approximately 42 million hectares of forests held by communities. Stronger community forest rights could stem the tide of the country’s rampant forest loss, mostly due to palm oil expansion.</P><P>“REDD+ was established because it is well known that deforestation is a significant part of the <mark>climate change</mark> problem. What is not as widely understood is how effective forest communities are at protecting their forest from deforestation and increasing forest health. This is why REDD+ must be accompanied by community safeguards,” said <STRONG>Tony LaVina, lead forest and <mark>climate</mark> negotiator for the Philippines and Dean of the Ateneo School of Government, Ateneo de Manila University</STRONG>. “Securing Rights, Combating <mark>Climate Change</mark> is an important work that connects the dots by showing that strengthening community forest rights needs to be part of a broader <mark>climate change</mark> solution.”

The report ‘<EM>Securing Rights, Combating <mark>Climate Change</mark></EM>’ highlights that an important element to support our objective to reduce deforestation, is to strengthen governance issues, including strengthening community forest rights, so that forest communities can withstand diverse pressures. The Peruvian Ministry of Environment as part of its objectives to support forest conservation, instituted a program that aims to strengthen the rights of forest communities and grant benefits for sustainably managing their forests. While there are many factors involved in deforestation, strengthening the rights of forest communities is simply the smart choice for the future of our people, our forests and our <mark>climate</mark>.”</P><P><STRONG>Robert ter Kuile, Senior Director Sustainability, PepsiCo, Inc:</STRONG></P><P>“<EM>Securing Rights, Combating <mark>Climate Change</mark></EM> demonstrates that PepsiCo’s commitment to respect the legitimate land tenure rights of indigenous peoples and other community members directly affected by forestry operations is not only good for businesses and communities; it is also good for combating <mark>climate change</mark> and reducing deforestation.”</P><P><STRONG>World Resources Institute (WRI)</STRONG> is a global research organization that spans more than 50 countries, with offices in the United States, China, India, Brazil, and more.

After a long run as a top purchaser of <A href=""http://www.epa.gov/grnpower/gpmarket/rec.htm"">Renewable Energy Certificates</A> (RECs), <A href=""http://www.pepsico.com/index.html"">PepsiCo</A> will not be on the list.
With the evolution of our sustainability strategy, we are establishing new and even more aggressive environmental performance goals, and as a result, our investment priorities are changing. 
After thorough review at the highest levels of our company, we have made the strategic decision to reduce our participation in the RECs market in order to focus on direct investments that will accelerate our use of alternative energy sources to power operations at the facility level throughout the PepsiCo network.
As part of this, we will be investing more than $30 million dollars in the next three years to develop new renewable energy projects in the U.S.
Some of the projects for this investment could include installation of a biomass boiler for a snack food facility; installation of solar photovoltaic and thermal generation in California beverage plants; development of bio-gas energy in Florida; and various photovoltaic projects at distribution centers or other facilities. 
We made this decision as part of our process to constantly evaluate ways to reduce our environmental impact. Our strategy has advanced to a point where it makes the most sense to invest in alternative energy projects within our own operations. This decision emphasizes our commitment to reduce our environmental footprint through direct actions and investment in our own facilities and where possible, those of our suppliers. 
Just a few weeks ago, these efforts were recognized by the <A href=""https://www.energystar.gov/"">EPA Energy Star Program</A>. We were again honored as <A href=""https://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=pt_awards.showAwardDetails&amp;esa_id=3819"">Partner of the Year with Sustained Excellence</A> in large part for programs that extend energy savings beyond our own facilities to our supply chain.
We are proud that our investment in RECs has stimulated the development of renewable energy in the U.S. over the past few years, and motivated others to follow. PepsiCo took a substantial early position in the RECs market and we are pleased to see that it has developed strongly since. At the time, the options for investing directly into alternative and renewable energy were not as robust or economic as they are today. Now, we believe we can have a greater impact on <mark>carbon</mark> reduction by developing renewable and alternative energy solutions at a facility level. 
Throughout our organization, we remain committed to evolving our use of renewable energy operations and will continue to make a concerted effort to replace our existing use of oil, gas and fossil fuels in manufacturing with renewable energy sources.

Fuel and natural gas are also important commodities for us due to their use in our facilities and the vehicles delivering our products. We employ specialists to secure adequate supplies of many of these items and have not experienced any significant continuous shortages that would prevent us from meeting our requirements. Many of these ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers. In addition, we continue to make investments to improve the sustainability and resources of our agricultural supply chain, including by developing our initiative to advance <mark>sustainable</mark> farming practices by our suppliers and expanding it globally. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on how we manage our exposure to commodity costs.</FONT></DIV><DIV style=""line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;font-size:12pt;""><FONT style=""font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;font-weight:bold;"">Our Brands and Intellectual Property Rights</FONT></DIV><DIV style=""line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:12pt;""><FONT style=""font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;"">We own numerous valuable trademarks which are essential to our worldwide businesses, including Agusha, Amp Energy, Aquafina, Aquafina Flavorsplash, Aunt Jemima, Cap’n Crunch, Cheetos, Chester’s, Chipsy, Chudo, Cracker Jack, Crunchy, Diet Mountain Dew, Diet Mug, Diet Pepsi, Diet 7UP (outside the United States), Diet Sierra Mist, Domik v Derevne, Doritos, Duyvis, Elma Chips, Emperador, Frito-Lay, Fritos, Fruktovy Sad, Frustyle, G Series, G2, Gatorade, Grandma’s, Imunele, Izze, Kas, Kurkure, Lay’s, Life, Lifewater, Lubimy, Manzanita Sol, Marias Gamesa, Matutano, Mirinda, Miss Vickie’s, Mother’s, Mountain Dew, Mountain Dew Code Red, Mountain Dew Kickstart, Mug, Munchies, Naked, Near East, O.N.E., Paso de los Toros, Pasta Roni, Pepsi, Pepsi Max, Pepsi Next, Propel, Quaker, Quaker Chewy, Rice-A-Roni, Rold Gold, Rosquinhas Mabel, Ruffles, Sabritas, Sakata, Saladitas, Sandora, Santitas, 7UP (outside the United States) and 7UP Free (outside the United States), Sierra Mist, Simba, Smartfood, Smith’s, Snack a Jacks, SoBe, SoBe Lifewater, SoBe V Water, Sonric’s, Stacy’s, Sting, SunChips, Tonus, Tostitos, Trop 50, Tropicana, Tropicana Farmstand, Tropicana Pure Premium, Tropicana Twister, Vesely Molochnik, Walkers and Ya.

Our success also depends on: product quality; our ability to extend our portfolio of products in growing markets and categories; our ability to respond to cultural differences and regional consumer preferences; our ability to monitor and adjust our use of ingredients to respond to applicable local regulations; our ability to develop or acquire new products that are responsive to certain consumer preferences; our ability to develop a broader portfolio of product choices and continue to increase non-<mark>carbon</mark>ated beverage offerings and other alternatives to traditional <mark>carbon</mark>ated beverage offerings; our ability to develop sweetener alternatives and <mark>innovation</mark>; our ability to improve the production and packaging of our products; and our ability to respond to competitive product and pricing pressures.

If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and maintain our information technology infrastructure, including monitoring networks and systems, upgrading our security policies and the skills and training of our employees, and requiring our third-party service providers, customers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties to do the same, if we or they fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, or if our information systems are damaged, compromised, destroyed or shut down (whether as a result of natural disasters, fires, power outages, acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events, network outages, software, equipment or telecommunications failures, technology development defects, user errors, or from deliberate cyberattacks such as malicious or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering, hackers or otherwise), our business could be disrupted and we could, among other things, be subject to: transaction errors; processing inefficiencies; the loss of, or failure to attract new, customers and consumers; the loss of revenues from unauthorized use, acquisition or disclosure of, or access to, confidential information; the loss of, or damage to, intellectual property or trade secrets, including the loss or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data or other assets; damage to our reputation; litigation; regulatory enforcement actions; violation of data privacy, security or other laws and regulations; and remediation costs. Further, our information systems and the information stored therein could be compromised by, and we could experience similar adverse consequences due to, unauthorized outside parties’ intent on accessing or extracting sensitive data or confidential information, corrupting information or disrupting business processes (or demonstrating an ability to do so) or by inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, agents or third parties. Similar risks exist with respect to the third-party vendors that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions, and systems managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties and their vendors. While we currently maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address certain aspects of cyber incidents, network failures and data privacy-related concerns, this insurance coverage may not, depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise from an incident, or the damage to our reputation or brands that may result from an incident.</FONT></DIV><DIV style=""text-align:center;""><DIV style=""line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;""><FONT style=""font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"">22</FONT></DIV></DIV><DIV><DIV style=""line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;""><A style=""font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"" href=""#s66932313011856149FD55B22001688C6""><FONT style=""font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"">Table of Contents</FONT></A></DIV></DIV><DIV style=""line-height:120%;padding-bottom:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:12pt;""><FONT style=""font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;"">If we are not able to successfully implement shared services or utilize information technology systems and networks effectively, our ability to conduct our business might be negatively impacted.</FONT></DIV><DIV style=""line-height:120%;padding-bottom:13px;text-align:justify;font-size:12pt;""><FONT style=""font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;"">We have entered into agreements with third-party service providers to share certain information technology support services and administrative functions, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions, and may enter into agreements for shared services in other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies.

If any of these third-party service providers or vendors do not perform effectively, or if we fail to adequately monitor their performance, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings or we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers and our reputation could be harmed.

[…]</P></DIV></HEADER><DIV class=""submission__content entry-content""><P>Introduction</P><P>The world’s population is expected to grow by nearly 20% from 7.4B to 9B by 2050. This growth will substantially increase food production requirements with estimates that production will need to increase by as high as 70 percent to meet demand. [1] To hit this level of production, food and beverage industry will need to overcome operating with lower yields and increased production costs caused by <mark>climate change</mark>. Interestingly, the food and beverage industry is a key contributor to the phenomenon which stands to hurt their profitability in the long-run. The top 10 companies – including PepsiCo – emit 263.7 million tons per annum of GHGs which is the equivalent of being the 25th most polluting country in the world. [2]</P><P>PepsiCo is a large, multinational player in the industry. The company generated more than $63B in net revenue in 2015 with 22 brands like Frito-Lay, Pepsi-Cola, Quaker, and Tropicana. [3] Their brands are leaders in key categories (e.g., Gatorade, #1 sports drink, Quaker, the #1 hot cereal, Sabra, the #1 hummus) and are well-positioned for continued growth. <mark>Climate change</mark> poses detrimental risk to PepsiCo’s supply chain by limiting availability of key natural resources required for its product.</P><P>Supply and Demand Effects of Client Change</P><P>Agricultural raw materials from suppliers are the primary input for PepsiCo’s products and they are being impacted by <mark>climate change</mark> a few key ways. Firstly, agriculture uses a substantial portion of the world’s available freshwater supply and water availability is becoming increasingly limited. There is also an increasing prevalence of shocks to the systems like storms, floods, drought, and shifting pattern, which cause crop failures and supply disruption. [3] Some other issues caused by <mark>climate change</mark> which impact agriculture include changes in average temperature, rainfall, soil quality, and pest / diseases.</P><P><mark>Climate change</mark> regulation also poses a threat to PepsiCo’s business model. Governments are seeking creative ways to reduce global warming. For example, San Francisco’s mayor recently banned water bottle purchases due to the amount of oil and <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions required to produce the plastic bottles. This directly impacts the demand for PepsiCo’s products since it has Aquafina as part of its portfolio. Additionally, government regulation may directly impact operating costs when governments choose to tax or set limits for greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P>Performance with Purpose</P><P>Core to PepsiCo’s approach is its Performance with Purpose strategy, which the company describes as “our goal to deliver top-tier financial performance while creating <mark>sustainable</mark> growth in shareholder value.” [1] Moreover, according to Indra Nooyi, Chairman and CEO, the “strategy is built on <mark>sustainable</mark> business practices that optimize our near-term operating efficiency and profitability while ensuring that we are well positioned to deliver long-term business growth.” [1] The strategy has three different focus areas (Product, Planet, and People) and over the past ten years since its launch has made significant progress towards reducing its contribution to <mark>climate change</mark> and has developed new technology to help suppliers increase their yield.</P><P>Notable operational improvements to reduce their <mark>carbon</mark> footprint include:
• Reduced water use per unit of production by 25.8%, exceeding their goal of 20%, and reduced costs by $80M over five years
• Provided access to safe water to 9 million people through PepsiCo foundation
• Improved energy efficiency by 18% and absolute GHG emissions by 4%
• Reduced packaging material. [1]</P><P>One example of PepsiCo’s contribution to the supply side is with the potato farmers in water-stressed UK. They developed i-crop technology with Cambridge University and employed different irrigation method to halve water use and cut GHG emissions by 50% since 2010. [1]</P><P>PepsiCo’s primary goals for 2025 as part of Performance with Purpose is to:
• Improve water-use efficiency by 15% among direct agricultural suppliers in high- water-risk sourcing areas
• Reduce absolute GHG emissions by at least 20% across value chain by 2030
• By 2020 only purchase HFC-Free Equipment in the U.S. [1]</P><P>This shift to focus on improving the efficiency of its supply side will significantly reduce PepsiCo’s exposure to <mark>climate change</mark> risk.</P><P>Plan Forward</P><P>Despite considerable focus on sustainability as part of its Performance with Purpose strategy, PepsiCo has come under scrutiny for its simultaneous funding of lobbying groups and politicians described as “<mark>climate</mark> deniers,” who oppose <mark>climate change</mark> regulation. [4] PepsiCo has the potential to be a true industry leader and should focus on ensuring that its corporate actions and messaging is consistent with the work its done on the sustainability front. According to Oxfam, “if each of the Big 10 companies made the same commitment to cut emissions from agriculture as PepsiCo UK, together they could save an extra 80 million tons of <mark>CO2</mark>e compared to business as-usual by 2020.” [2] Moreover, the company should critically examine whether the targets it has set for itself are aspirational and will protect its future profitability.</P><P>Word count: 798</P><P>[1] PepsiCo, Inc., “Performance with Purpose 2025 Agenda,” http://www.pepsico.com/docs/album/sustainability-reporting/pepsico_sustainability_report_2015_and_-2025_agenda.pdf, accessed November 2016.

Heinz Company; Hormel Foods Corporation; Kellogg Company; Kraft Food Group, Inc.; Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Corp.; Mars Inc.; Mondelez International, Inc.; Nestlé S.A.; Nissin Foods Holdings Co., Ltd.; PepsiCo, Inc.; The Hershey Company; The J.M. Smucker Company; Toyo Suisan Kaisha, Ltd.; and Unilever—manufacture a wide range of popular snack foods in the United States and abroad that contain conflict palm oil.</P><P>While some companies are beginning to take steps to address their palm oil problem, none have yet adopted and fully implemented adequate safeguards to eliminate conflict palm oil from entering their supply chains and contaminating their products. These big, global food companies have the power, through their supply chains, to drive a transformation in the way palm oil is now commonly produced. Increased consumer and citizen pressure on these companies is a key ingredient for success.</P><P>Working together with our families, friends, and allies, we will hold these companies to account and push them to eliminate conflict palm oil from their products. We will work with them to adopt and implement responsible palm oil procurement policies that ensure the palm oil they buy is not associated with deforestation, child or forced labor, plantation expansion on <mark>carbon</mark>-rich peatlands, or violations of forest-dependent communities’ rights.</P><P>The fate of the orangutan, forest peoples, and some of the world’s most rich and important rainforests hang in the balance.</P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The fact that they haven’t demonstrates that it is not a lack of ability holding them back, but a lack of will.”</P><P>Leuser’s vanishing ecosystem is already have <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2017/apr/03/sumatran-elephants-a-fragile-future-in-pictures"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">a devastating effect</A> on <A href=""http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/199856/0"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">critically endangered elephants</A> which use it as a migratory corridor. <A href=""https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/rainforestactionnetwork/pages/14963/attachments/original/1447185025/Last_Place_2015.pdf?1447185025"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">At least 35 elephants</A> were killed in Leuser between 2012-2015, and human-animal conflicts are fast increasing as palm plantations fragment animal habitats.</P><P>Many species such as <A href=""http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/15966/0"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">tigers</A>, <A href=""http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/14519/0"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">clouded leopards</A> and <A href=""http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/9760/0"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">sun bears</A> are becoming more vulnerable to poachers, as their environment disappears.

Two months later, Aceh’s governor, Zaini Abdullah ordered palm oil companies to halt all forest clearing, even where valid permits existed.</P><P>But RAN’s research shows that ABN continued clearing another 336 hectares of Sumatran rainforest after Abdullah’s instruction, with 12 hectares of new deforestation since February.</P><P>In just one district of the Leuser, nine other suppliers to milling companies continued logging activities since last June across concessions with a combined area of more than 26,000 hectares, according to RAN’s research.</P><P>Tillack said: “We believe that there was a rush to clear land because the [logging] companies knew that there would be government intervention to stop forest clearances. </P><P>“Global brands like <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/pepsico"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Pepsico</A> can no longer hide behind paper promises and simply blame their international partners for forest crimes. The Leuser ecosystem will die a death of a thousand cuts if brands don’t start taking urgent action to address the root cause of this crisis.”</P><P>A spokesman for Pepsico, singled out by RAN as <A draggable=""true"" href=""https://www.ran.org/the_ultimate_laggard"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">“the ultimate snack food 20 laggard”</A>, said “We take this issue very seriously, and we are making significant investments to improve every aspect of our palm oil supply chain.

While we do not source directly from the mills in question, we identified direct suppliers who had the mills in their supply chains. We have been assured that these suppliers are taking corrective actions to address the allegations.”</P><P>Unilever admitted that it had indirectly bought palm oil from PT ABN through its suppliers, Wilmar and Musim Mas, and said that it had requested “a response and an action plan” from them soon.</P><P>Nestlé also said that it was investigating the allegations with Wilmar – which told the guardian that it was sending a team to the region to assess whether <A href=""http://www.wilmar-international.com/sustainability/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/170622_Grievance-update_R1.pdf"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">other sources in its supply chain </A>were using palm oil sourcing back to PT ABN’s 2,000 hectare concession.</P><P>Mars and Kellogg’s stressed their <mark>sustainable</mark> palm oil policies, while Procter &amp; Gamble said that it had told suppliers about its responsible sourcing policy. McDonald’s denied any links to PT ABN.</P><P>Of the palm oil traders which supplying the food brands, IOI said that that it had “<A href=""http://europe.ioiloders.com/images/applications/Channohan_full_mill_list_2016Q2-2017-Q1.pdf"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">registered recent deliveries</A> from PT ES in our supply chain” but that the firm had “confirmed that they no longer source from PT ABN”. </P><P>Golden Agri-Resources said that its exposure to PT ES was “relatively small” but that it would visit the company in the next weeks to find out if it was indirectly selling on palm oil from PT ABN. Cargill and Musim Mas both said that they were investigating the reports.</P><P>However, the companies had been warned about ‘conflict palm oil’ entering the supply chain through PT ES’s third-party suppliers since 2014, and engagement with the firm had not changed its behaviour.</P><P>“Brands and traders tend to hide behind supply chain complexities,” she said, “but consumers need to know whether or not the palm oil they use is connected to the destruction of rainforests.”</P><DIV class=""submeta""><SPAN class=""submeta__label"">Topics</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

(NYSE: PEP) announced a strategic partnership to spur social and economic development in emerging markets through a unique social enterprise model. The partnership's inaugural project was launched in Maharashtra, India with an agriculture initiative to source vitamin-rich cashew fruit from smallholder farmers, an arrangement that is expected to create an important new ingredient supply for PepsiCo’s local juice business while simultaneously improving the livelihood of thousands of cashew growers in the region.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Through the Clinton Foundation’s Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership model, founded by President Bill Clinton and philanthropist Frank Giustra, this initiative will apply modern agricultural techniques to improve cashew farming practices, boost yield and productivity, and increase income for local smallholder farmers. It will also scale up and strengthen India’s cashew supply chain to build the future potential of a domestic and export market.Most cashew farmers in this area of India farm on less than one hectare of land and live below the poverty line.  The Clinton Foundation’s Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership uses market-driven models to improve the livelihood of smallholder farmers by providing training, facilitating the purchase of their harvest, and handling their distribution and logistics. The approach has been designed for replication in value chains throughout the world and is currently catalyzing similar supply chain enterprises in Latin America and Haiti.Cashew fruit – which typically goes unused by most cashew nut farmers – is high in nutritional value. It is rich in potassium and contains as much as five times the vitamin C as an orange and 50 times the vitamin C as an apple. PepsiCo plans to use cashew fruit juice as one of the ingredients in some of its blended fruit juice products in India.“Committed partners like PepsiCo demonstrate the tremendous impact that social enterprises and the private sector can make when they work together to solve business problems that also advance social good,” said President Clinton.“This initiative embodies Performance with Purpose – PepsiCo’s recognition that our success is inextricably linked to society’s success,” said Indra K. Nooyi, PepsiCo’s Chairman and CEO.  “<mark>Sustainable</mark> agriculture is critical to PepsiCo’s supply chain and we have a long history of working with local farmers around the world in ways that strengthen our business and the communities in which we operate. This partnership is a great example of aligning business and societal priorities, and we see great potential in continued collaboration with the Clinton Foundation.”The program’s first India cashew harvest is currently underway. The fruit will be sourced from more than 2,000 smallholder farmers in 2014, with plans to scale the opportunity to as many as 15,000 over the next five years. PepsiCo India plans to begin incorporating the fruit into some of its blended juice products starting in Spring 2015.“The Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership’s unique approach has the potential to generate meaningful impact in the developing world.  We believe that by creating, scaling and replicating social enterprises in selected value chains we can help disadvantaged populations work themselves out of poverty,” said Frank Giustra.</SPAN></P><P align=""center""># # #</P><P>Learn more about our work at <A href=""//www.clintonfoundation.org/about"">http://www.clintonfoundation.org/about</A>, on Facebook at <A class=""ext"" href=""http://facebook.com/ClintonFoundation"" target=""_blank"">Facebook.com/ClintonFoundation</A> and on Twitter <A class=""ext"" href=""https://twitter.com/clintonfdn"" target=""_blank"">@ClintonFdn</A>.</P><P><SPAN><STRONG>About PepsiCo</STRONG>PepsiCo products are enjoyed by consumers one billion times a day in more than 200 countries and territories around the world.

From its foundation till now, Pepsi has been through a long journey and reached the position of a leader in the beverages industry. The name of the company that makes Pepsi Cola is Pepsico. The company utilizes unique advertising and marketing strategies that have been highly effective and generate high revenue. Apart from it Pepsi has very few rivals in the industry.  The level of loyalty and popularity it enjoys can be challenged by pretty few brands.</P><P>Pepsi is among the most well-known brands in the <mark>carbon</mark>ated beverages industry. The brand is present in more than 200 countries across the globe. Its brand presence and loyalty both are high. Its product portfolio is made up of more than 22 products that bring more than a billion in yearly revenue. Some well-known brands in its portfolio are Pepsi, Mountain Dew, 7up, Tropicana, and frito lays. Its Pepsi and Max enjoy particularly very high popularity. Aquafina is also near the top in terms of market share with around 10% market share. Gatorade from Pepsi leads the sports drinks category and accounts for nearly 70% sales in the sports drinks market. A large part of Pepsi’s revenue comes from the sales of soft drinks. Challenged only by Coca Cola, it is among the industry leaders in the beverages sector. However, Pepsi also produces and sells snacks. In terms of competition, Pepsi is second only to Coca Cola.</P><P> </P><P>Bradham invented Pepsi in 1890 but the incorporation of the company took place in 1919 and then again in 1986 in North Carolina.  The company’s merger with Frito Lays in 1960 led to the brand’s entry into the snacks industry. Overtime, the company also made a large number of acquisitions including that of Tropicana and Gatorade. However, the journey is not yet over and the company is looking for new opportunities of expansion. Pepsi’s market share in the US <mark>carbon</mark>ated beverages market is at close to 30%. Behind it, is the power of marketing that Pepsi has utilized perfectly.</P><H3>Changing consumer preferences:</H3><P>There are several factors that impact the demand for Pepsi. First of all, it is the consumer’s own preference that has an impact on it. If the consumer preference is for Pepsi, the brand enjoys high popularity and demand.  However, consumer preference can also change owing to certain factors. Most common factors that affect consumers’ preference are lifestyle factors, health factors and economic factors. However, Pepsi has priced its products in most markets in a manner that suits its consumers’ pockets.  So, pricing is not a factor that would make its consumers switch preferences.  However, in terms of health, Pepsi would not be considered a very hygienic product or the one suited to the taste of health conscious. When it comes to lifestyle, the emphasis is on promoting it as a product for the youngsters. Pepsi is innovative in terms of marketing and the heavy expenditure it incurs in this area is not without a reason.</P><P> </P><H3>Reputation of the brand:</H3><P>Damage to reputation can also affect the demand for Pepsi among its customers. The brands which have a great relationship with their customers rule the market. This relationship can grow weaker if the brand’s reputation is damaged. The market is highly competitive and the brands have to continually focus on customer engagement. Pepsi is adept at doing its job in this area. Its marketing and advertising campaigns are directed at engaging customers efficiently. However, people must not have forgotten the Cola wars and why they were called the cola wars. When a brand takes the size of a war it implies the brand has shined and is rising on the consumers’ perception. Now, customer perception is shaped by so many things and a damage to reputation is bound to affect it negatively.  A damage to reputation can happen from various sources. It can happen due to legal issues or sometimes even due to product quality. Pepsi is facing legal challenges. The legal battles it is engaged in do not get to end. Product quality issues are and will remain an important issue always.  Pepsi is in the food and beverages sector and if there is any issue with the quality of its products, the result will be legal challenges and damage to reputation.  Pepsi can in no condition ignore the quality issue.  It is a top priority for any brand in the food and beverages sector. However, both Pepsi and Coca Cola have faced challenges because of the presence of harmful products including pesticides in their products. Moreover, for both Pepsi and Coca Cola have a major stake in the US market. A sizable part of their revenue comes from US where the laws related to product quality are relatively stringent. So, both law and quality factors have a major influence on Pepsi’s demand.</P><P> </P><H3>Aging and other factors</H3><P>However, this was just a part of the picture. Lifestyle can also be affected by certain other factors. Aging is a factor that directly impacts the lifestyle of people. Moreover, the population of America is aging fast so this will have an impact on product demand of Pepsi. However, such factors are outside the control of Pepsi and therefore the focus of the brand must remain on the remaining consumer segment it can still depend upon. However, the millennial generation cannot be reached with traditional techniques. Pepsi must continuously focus upon innovative and outside the box marketing practices. Marketing handles a considerable  part of the brand’s burden. The recession has led to a slowdown in the soda industry. (<A href=""https://www.cheshnotes.com/2016/11/pepsi-swot-analysis-2016/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Check this swot analysis of Pepsi to see how its revenue and profits have fallen</A>) However, if CEO Indra Nooyi is still not disheartened then it is because the brand has some key strengths and a competitive advantage. So really, much of the focus of Pepsi has to be on marketing to the millenials.</P><P> </P><H3>Economic and legal factors</H3><P>The global recession has had a major impact on the consumer demand of Pepsi.  As the economic conditions saw a downturn, the market of Pepsi saw a hard decline. However, the trouble has been faced by rivals too including Coca Cola. The dollar has grown stronger since the recession adding to the problems of Pepsi. It cannot depend on the markets outside US for its revenue. Economic conditions too are outside the control of Pepsi and if market conditions change swiftly and the dollar falls, might be Pepsi’s days could return faster. Company’s finances are affected by other factors too that include interest rates and taxes as well. Any change in the financial factors too might have a major affect on the bottom line of Pepsi. Legal and regulatory changes can also add to the operating costs. While it might not affect demand, the profits are still affected.   However, laws can sometimes be a big pain for brands. Whether it is marketing, advertising, labeling, or any other part of business operations laws can make it costlier for the brands to run the business. Even if these factors do not impact demand directly, an indirect effect can still be recognized.</P><P> </P><H3>Natural factors</H3><P>There are even natural factors behind demand and supply. <mark>Climate change</mark>, sustainability, water scarcity are all factors that despite not being related directly can impact demand and supply. However, sometimes their impact can be direct when they shift the consumers’ focus towards other things. Natural disasters, global warming, water shortage, decreased agricultural output etc are not small concerns. These factors can impact the pricing and then create a downward pressure on demand.  If the impact is on supply, demand is going to be affected. If the supply of raw materials is low, like decreased availability of water, sugarcane or corn, its effect will be felt on production. Low production means low supply and in turn it means a pressure on brand to raise the prices to match the expected revenue.</P><P> </P><H3>Cultural Factors</H3><P>If you analyse carefully, the social and cultural factors too influence demand. Why the demand in the US market is high whereas it is lower in the other countries? Culture is the reason. Pepsi is a brand that is associated in most markets with the Western culture. In the Eastern culture unless Pepsi is successful at localizing its brand image, the demand will remain low. Societies throughout the world have their own perceptions of the brand. Culture is the prism through which the people have seen things around them. The perception of a US consumer of things happening around him would be different than the average US consumer. It is why in the other markets a consumer would find it a bit difficult to associate Pepsi with his lifestyle. The effect of all these factors has to be kept in mind to assess the market demand of Pepsi.</P><P> </P><H3>Effect of Competition</H3><P>All these things apart, there is the effect of competition. The main competitors of Pepsi include Coca Cola and Dr Pepper Snapple. The Cola wars are said to be continuing still. Pepsi and Coca Cola are always engaged in a fierce battle. The battle grows fiercer because the level of loyalty the two brands enjoy is high. Sometimes, the rising popularity of one brand can affect the demand of the other. Moreover, competition at times can be the most difficult factor to manage. If brands like Coca Cola and Pepsi spend too much on marketing, they know they cannot let the consumer go. Customer engagement requires such intense focus. The effect of competition is also very deep to be assessed fully.  Coca Cola leads the US market with 43% share followed by Pepsi at 30%. However, in several other parts of the world Pepsi has proved cleverer and been able to grab a better share. Still, that does not reduce the importance of the US market.</P><P>So, you can see that customer demand is a significant factor related to the bottom line of the brand. It is affected by several factors. Brands need to manage these factors to have a favorable bottom line. There are several direct and several indirect competitors of Pepsi. While marketing can help it handle several of the pressures, some factors are still not in Pepsi’s control. Much if its  fate will depend on the changes it has made to its product portfolio. However, since Pepsi and Coca Cola are close competitors, the same factors affect the consumer demand of Coca Cola too.</P><P> </P></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Yet some food companies are actually making the problem worse.</P><P>The world’s 10 biggest food and beverage companies are not only highly vulnerable to the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>—they’re also contributing to the problem. A <A href=""/explore/research-publications/standing-on-the-sidelines/"">new study from Oxfam America</A> found that these 10 companies (which include Associated British Foods, Coca-Cola, Danone, General Mills, Kellogg, Mars, Mondelez International, Nestlé, PepsiCo, and Unilever) emit so much greenhouse gas through their supply chains that if they were a single country, they would be the 25th most polluting in the world.</P><P>The study also shows that some of these companies are not doing nearly enough to tackle <mark>climate change</mark>. Kellogg and General Mills (makers of popular breakfast cereals and other well-known brands) claim to be reducing their emissions, but they don’t even measure or fully disclose them, let alone have targets to reduce them. They do business with companies that worsen <mark>climate change</mark> by burning down forests to clear land and by overusing polluting fertilizers.</P><P><mark>Climate change</mark> contributes to storms, floods, droughts and shifting weather patterns. This affects food supplies and is putting pressure on prices, causing more hunger and poverty. Experts predict that by 2050 there will be 50 million more people made hungry because of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>“Too many of today’s food and beverage giants are crossing their fingers and hoping that <mark>climate change</mark> won’t disrupt the food system,” said Raymond C. Offenheiser, president of Oxfam America. “The ‘Big 10’ food companies generate over $1 billion a day and have great power to influence global food chains. If the companies who profit most from a safe and reliable food supply won’t help stop the <mark>climate</mark> crisis, who will?”</P><P>The “Big 10” should be capable of cutting their combined emissions by a further 80 million tons by 2020. This would be equivalent to taking all of the cars in Los Angeles, Beijing, London, and New York off the road.</P><P>Oxfam is calling on General Mills and Kellogg to lead the sector towards more responsible policies and practices. We’re asking them to:</P><UL><LI><B>Know and show: </B>Disclose emissions from their supply chains that contribute to <mark>climate change</mark> and drive global hunger.</LI><LI><B> Act: </B>Commit to clear, science-based targets and actions that reduce emissions from their operations and supply chains.</LI><LI><B>Speak up: </B>Use their power and influence to call on governments and businesses to do what’s needed to protect the future of our food.</LI></UL><P><B>You can help.</B> Hundreds of thousands of you have already joined Oxfam’s <A href=""http://www.behindthebrands.org/"">Behind the Brands</A> campaign calling on the world’s biggest food companies to improve their policies on everything from women’s equality to land rights. Thanks to you, giants like PepsiCo and Nestlé have taken concrete steps to improve their policies—and the industry has taken notice.</P><P>Even the biggest companies care what customers think. So when you speak, they listen. Tell General Mills and Kellogg to help stop <mark>climate change</mark> from making people hungry.

As a <A href=""http://www.nature.com/n<mark>climate</mark>/journal/v6/n7/full/n<mark>climate</mark>2972.html"">peer-reviewed study</A> in the journal <EM>Nature</EM> recently found (and the <EM>New York Times</EM> reported): &quot;even if the world is able to stave off an increase in atmospheric temperatures of 2 degrees Celsius or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit — a goal agreed to as part of the Paris deal — <STRONG><mark>climate change</mark> could wipe out</STRONG><STRONG>$1.7 trillion worth of global financial assets.&quot;</STRONG></P><P>So, I’m hopeful that, at least in terms of sustainability, the rational decisions being made on Wall Street will act as a counter-balance to what appears to be erratic decisions coming out of Washington.

This is a very convincing story for job creation and economic growth.” My colleagues at EDF <mark>Climate</mark> Corps <A href=""http://edf<mark>climate</mark>corps.org/nowhiringreport"">back this up with data;</A> the sustainability sector is booming with jobs that 1.) can’t be outsourced, and 2.) are readily available in all fifty states.</LI><LI>A WEF <A href=""http://www3.weforum.org/docs/IP/2016/CO/WEF_AM17_FutureofRetailInsightReport.pdf"">report</A> on the future of retail talks about “the golden age of the consumer” and the implications and opportunities that are created for sustainability by addressing how goods are delivered—what is called the “last mile of delivery”—and how products are packaged.</LI><LI><A href=""https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/3-predictions-for-the-future-of-retail-from-the-ceo-of-walmart"">Commenting on that same report</A>, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon pointed out that sustainability will impact retail in ways far beyond logistics and packaging: in this age of social media sharing, the push for transparency in supply chains will be customer-driven. McMillon knows that “<STRONG>retailers will only survive if their business creates shared value that benefits shareholders and society</STRONG>.”</LI><LI>Finally, in a recent op-ed entitled <A href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/15/<mark>climate</mark>-change-walmart-business-leadership-commentary.html""><EM>Why Walmart is doubling down on its commitment to <mark>climate change</mark></EM>,</A> Walmart board member Rob Walton, gave a simple answer: because it’s good for business! “We set [our <mark>climate</mark> goals] because we wanted to help address <mark>climate change</mark> and improve lives, while also strengthening our company and reducing expenses,” he said. “We thought it would be a win-win: good for society, and good for Walmart.  Eleven years later, that's exactly what we've seen.”<DIV id=""attachment_6429"" style=""width: 238px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Elizabeth Sturcken, Managing Director, EDF+Business</P></DIV></LI></UL><P>That’s a long list—and one that adds to the mounting evidence that corporate America “gets it”:</P><P>momentum for business leadership on sustainability is here to stay. Which is in no way surprising, because after my many years of working with business, I’ve seen firsthand the immense value creation that comes with moving forward—not backward—on environmental issues.</P><P>So, for all that has changed in these times of “alternative facts,” those who care about having a livable, thriving planet can feel confident that they have a powerful ally in business.

Porter and Forest L. Reinhardt</H4><P><mark>Climate change</mark> is now a fact of political life and is playing a growing role in business competition. Greenhouse gas emissions will be increasingly scrutinized, regulated, and priced. While individual managers can disagree about how immediate and significant the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> will be, companies need to take action now.</P><P>Companies that persist in treating <mark>climate change</mark> solely as a corporate social responsibility issue, rather than a business problem, will risk the greatest consequences. Of course, a company’s <mark>climate</mark> policies will be affected by stakeholder expectations and standards for social responsibility. But the effects of <mark>climate</mark> on companies’ operations are now so tangible and certain that the issue is best addressed with the tools of the strategist, not the philanthropist.</P><P><STRONG>From Effectiveness to Strategy</STRONG></P><P>There is no one-size-fits-all approach to <mark>climate change</mark>. Each company’s approach will depend on its particular business and should mesh with its overall strategy. For every company, the approach must include initiatives to mitigate <mark>climate</mark>-related costs and risks in its value chain. Business leaders need to start treating <mark>carbon</mark> emissions as costly, because they are or soon will be, and companies need to assess and reduce their vulnerability to <mark>climate</mark>-related environmental and economic shocks. Every firm needs to get those basics right, as a matter of operational effectiveness.<SUP>1</SUP></P><P>A firm that has more employees than it needs in its shipping department is operationally ineffective; its managers are wasting resources and creating a drag on performance. In the same way, a firm that produces excess emissions in its shipping operations is also operationally ineffective—it is wasting resources and incurring unnecessary costs that are certain to rise. Implementing best practices in managing <mark>climate</mark>-related costs is the minimum required to remain competitive.</P><P>In addition to understanding its emissions costs, every firm needs to evaluate its vulnerability to <mark>climate</mark>-related effects such as regional shifts in the availability of energy and water, the reliability of infrastructures and supply chains, and the prevalence of infectious diseases. The firm’s leaders should systematically assess these risks and then decide which to reduce through redesigning operations, which to transfer to others through insurance or hedging contracts, and which to bear.</P><P>For some, but not all, companies, the approach to <mark>climate change</mark> can go beyond operational effectiveness and become strategic. Some firms, in the process of addressing <mark>climate change</mark>, will find opportunities to enhance or extend their competitive positioning by creating products (such as hybrid cars) that exploit <mark>climate</mark>-induced demand, by leading the restructuring of their industries to address <mark>climate</mark> issues more effectively, or by innovating in activities affected by <mark>climate change</mark> to produce a genuine competitive advantage. For example, an operational response to <mark>climate change</mark> in outbound logistics or after-sales service might involve more-efficient engines on delivery and service vehicles, or modified schedules to reduce traffic delays. By contrast, strategic approaches could involve reconfiguring the activity entirely: In outbound logistics, firms might replace physical books or manuals with electronic versions, and in after-sales service, they could supplant physical visits by service technicians with remote diagnostics and treatment programs.</P><P><STRONG>Inside Out and Outside In</STRONG></P><P>To set a firm’s approach to <mark>climate change</mark> and assess the strategic opportunity, business leaders need to look “inside out” to understand the impact of the firm’s activities on the <mark>climate</mark> and “outside in” at how changing <mark>climate</mark> (in both its physical and its regulatory manifestations) may affect the business environment in which the firm competes.<SUP>2</SUP></P><P>To understand the inside-out impact, managers need to study the firm’s value chain. Any value-chain activity—inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing, sales, after-sales service—can generate emissions. The simple ratio of profits to total emissions in the value chain can be a very telling measure of potential <mark>climate</mark> impact. If new regulations put a price of, say, $10 a ton on emissions, would that put a significant dent in the profits or even swallow them altogether? “<mark>Carbon</mark> exposure” rises with the impact of <mark>carbon</mark> costs on profits. Like other risks, <mark>carbon</mark> exposure carries opportunities as well as challenges: Forestry companies, for example, may find that removing <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide from the air by planting trees may be as profitable as cutting them down and producing paper or plywood.</P><P>The emissions impact of activities in the value chain can be direct or indirect. Emissions can be generated by an activity under the firm’s direct control or induced by the firm in the activities of suppliers, channels, and customers. A company needs to understand the emissions it causes its business partners to produce, as well as those it generates itself: Both types are important targets for reduction.</P><P>These changing inside-out impacts have potentially revolutionary implications. For example, modern supply chains, with their transportation-intensive, just-in-time inventory management systems, may no longer be optimal in a world with more costly emissions. Similarly, e-commerce, with its proliferation of small shipments, may face real limits. And in some cases offshoring, which drives up emissions by lengthening transportation hauls, may be supplanted by lower-emissions onshoring to nearby clusters of suppliers.</P><P>High <mark>carbon</mark> exposure, as revealed by an inside-out analysis, does not by itself mean that <mark>climate</mark> is strategic for a firm. Once managers understand their firm’s overall <mark>carbon</mark> exposure and the emissions impact of specific activities in the value chain, they can devise an action plan to address them. Emissions-intensive activities that add little value are candidates for elimination or outsourcing to more-efficient firms. Those that are important to value may become strategic if a company can reduce its exposure relative to competitors through improved performance.</P><P>Inside-out analysis helps shed light on the logic behind Wal-Mart’s approach to <mark>climate</mark>. Wal-Mart’s activities are logistics- and transportation-intensive, and the firm is actively seeking to reduce the resultant emissions. At first blush this approach looks purely operational: The firm is reducing energy use to mitigate the potential harmful effects of emissions on costs in its value chain. Wal-Mart’s emissions-reduction programs will be strategic, however, if it can use its scale, scope, ability to invest heavily in technology, and reconfiguration of its value chain to reduce emissions in a way that is difficult for its smaller rivals to replicate. Wal-Mart seems to be making a strategic bet that it can reduce its <mark>carbon</mark> exposure more than competitors can and keep it lower.</P><P>In tandem with inside-out analysis, an outside-in look can reveal a new array of opportunities and threats. <mark>Climate change</mark> will affect a firm’s business environment in two broad ways: through shifting temperature and weather patterns, and through regulations that increase the cost of emissions. Either can affect the availability of business inputs; the size, growth, and nature of demand; access to related and supporting industries; and the rules and incentives surrounding industry rivalry. Business leaders should evaluate how <mark>climate change</mark> may affect each part of this context for competition.</P><P>While property insurers’ own <mark>carbon</mark> emissions may be low, for example, <mark>carbon</mark> exposure may be high for companies that insure or reinsure coastal real estate that is threatened by rising sea levels. Similarly, most of the <mark>carbon</mark> emissions associated with oil come not from oil companies but from their customers. Restrictions on emissions will constrain the demand for these companies’ products. Or consider the multifaceted outside-in impact on a food company like Nestlé. <mark>Climate change</mark> will alter the relative productivity of various regions in which the firm buys agricultural commodities, affecting input costs. At the same time, the regulatory responses to <mark>climate change</mark> will raise the costs of energy used in keeping ice cream cold in retail outlets, which will affect demand conditions. And so on. 
 </P><P>Firms can address outside-in effects strategically if they can manage them in ways that competitors cannot readily match. Nestlé eschews upstream vertical integration and instead outsources its raw material production. That makes its supply chain more flexible, which could provide valuable strategic advantage if the productivity of various regions shifts and Nestlé’s competitors find themselves constrained by their more rigid supply structures. Likewise, drought-resistant crop strains and vaccines and treatments for insect-borne diseases will become increasingly valuable (as long as their innovators can protect their intellectual property).</P><P>Periodically, major new forces dramatically reshape the business world—as globalization and the information technology revolution have been doing for the past several decades. <mark>Climate change</mark>, in its complexity and potential impact, may rival them both. While many companies may still think of global warming as a corporate social responsibility issue, business leaders need to approach it in the same hardheaded manner as any other strategic threat or opportunity. </P><DIV class=""special-body""><P><STRONG>Michael E.

How global companies respond today in the regions that may be hardest hit will affect the viability of the markets in those areas. Rather than retreat from them, however, companies need to improve their future resilience. This is as much a matter of strategy as of corporate social responsibility.</P><P>In the coming decades, we can expect to see sea levels rise and more extreme droughts, storms, and flooding. These events become security concerns for businesses when people are forced to flee, infrastructure is destroyed, ecosystems fail, agriculture is disrupted, economic volatility increases, and some regions become uninhabitable.</P><P>We know that <mark>climate</mark> extremes can destroy thriving business environments and even societies. The long, monstrous war in Darfur is properly understood as genocide caused by a struggle for resources that resulted from the kinds of events that will accompany <mark>climate change</mark>. Hurricane Katrina so severely damaged local infrastructure that many businesses still haven’t recovered. Imagine what will happen when, with even a modest sea level rise, flood-prone Bangladesh experiences increasingly severe monsoons and is all but submerged: More than one hundred million people could be forced to seek refuge in neighboring India or China, causing dangerous social and economic strain. Or imagine a drought in southern China that radically reduces the flow of the Mekong River, which runs through six Asian countries. The conflicts that would arise around access to water—for irrigation, for households, for industry—could disrupt this region’s fast-growing economies.</P><P>Companies need to anticipate the ways that <mark>climate change</mark> may directly affect their businesses, including supply-chain breakdowns, employee migrations, increases in disease, or even impact on reputation (multinational corporations may be blamed for <mark>climate</mark>-related environmental problems). But they also need to evaluate their risks more broadly, identifying whether the environments they operate in are susceptible to catastrophic, cascading <mark>climate</mark>-related disruption. To do so, they should systematically assess the vulnerability of these environments to floods, droughts, and storms, paying particular attention to areas that have a limited ability to anticipate and adapt to <mark>climate change</mark>. The most vulnerable will be places where, for example, the state has limited capacity to respond, the local ecosystem is fragile, urbanization is accelerating with few social services, and the water supply is already stretched. Haiti is perhaps the most extreme case, but India, the Philippines, and parts of Central America are all at risk. In such a stressed system, a severe, prolonged weather event could launch a crisis of interconnected events from which recovery might be impossible. 
 </P><P>Companies can help vulnerable regions plan for <mark>climate change</mark>, reducing their own risks by making proactive investments and supporting policy initiatives that they might have resisted in the past, such as tougher local air and water quality standards. And, of course, firms can be prepared themselves to help with urgent relief efforts when some of the worst effects actually do come about.</P><P>In fact, the systems vulnerabilities created by <mark>climate change</mark> can turn into “systems opportunities” for businesses to develop novel partnerships with government, other players in the supply chain, and even traditional competitors, for example in preparing the infrastructure needed for disaster recovery. By taking a leadership role in helping regions anticipate <mark>climate change</mark> and mitigate risk, companies can advance their interests while building goodwill in the communities in which they do business. Coca-Cola’s recently announced partnership with the World Wildlife Fund to help protect global water resources and improve the firm’s own water management is a good example of a company’s effort to address <mark>climate change</mark> both directly in its own operations and in the wider society it serves. Coke’s actions are likely to help both the company and local communities, while enhancing the company’s image around the world.</P><P>Multinational firms prepared to take the long view can avoid the worst consequences of <mark>climate change</mark> and perhaps help business build a stronger reputation as a powerful agent of societal well-being. </P><DIV class=""special-body""><P><STRONG>Peter Schwartz</STRONG> (<A href=""mailto:schwartz@gbn.com"">schwartz@gbn.com</A>) is a cofounder and the chairman of Global Business Network, a strategy consultancy in San Francisco and part of the Monitor Group.

Esty</H4><P>As Apple sped toward the June 2007 launch of its innovative iPhone, the company hit an awkward bump in the road. An environmental group called <mark>Climate</mark> Counts released a scorecard ranking major corporations on their tracking, reporting, and reduction of greenhouse gases. Apple came in dead last in the electronics industry category, with a score of 2 out of 100. Accounts of Apple’s abysmal performance spread instantly in the blogosphere and were reported by MSNBC, the <EM>Wall Street Journal Online</EM>, Reuters, and other mainstream media.</P><P>Should Steve Jobs be worried? Absolutely. Increasingly, customers, employees, and capital markets—as well as governments and NGOs—expect companies to release public reports on greenhouse gas emissions, make progress in improving energy efficiency, and hit targets for reducing emissions. Companies that fail to meet those expectations face potentially serious business consequences, for four broad reasons.</P><P>First, subpar environmental performance has become hard to hide and threatening to a company’s reputation. The <mark>Climate</mark> Counts ranking of Apple was only the most recent in a series of damning evaluations of the company by such organizations as the <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project. Poor marks on reporting and managing <mark>climate</mark> impact are putting Apple’s reputation for being cutting-edge and cool at risk. That may seem far-fetched, given Apple’s robust performance and passionate customers. But some environmental NGOs have begun raising consumer awareness about Apple’s lack of environmental effort, the most notable being Greenpeace with its “Green myApple” campaign, which took the company to task for its “iWaste,” and company executives, including Steve Jobs, have privately expressed concern about a backlash against the firm for its poor environmental ratings. In a May 2007 letter posted on Apple’s website, Jobs acknowledged the criticism of the company’s environmental performance and pledged to henceforth “openly [discuss] our plans to become a greener Apple.” 
 </P><P>Second, smart management of environmental issues has become a way to positively shape brand image and attract new customers. To date, the evidence on this front is anecdotal rather than rigorously statistical. But growing public interest in <mark>climate</mark>-friendly companies and products is driving many major firms to put a green stake in the ground.</P><P><mark>Carbon</mark> reporting and emissions management has become a public relations battleground among supermarkets in the UK, for example. After Tesco pledged to invest £100 million in environmental technologies to reduce its energy consumption, Marks &amp; Spencer announced that it would go “<mark>carbon</mark> neutral,” coming out with a 100-point action plan on <mark>climate change</mark> and the environment. Conveying a dramatic sense of urgency, company CEO Stuart Rose observed, “We are calling this ‘Plan A’ because there is no ‘Plan B.’ “A few days later, Tesco responded by promising to label all 70,000 items it sells with data on each product’s <mark>carbon</mark> footprint. Highly visible moves like these reveal a keen understanding of customers’ shifting attitudes.</P><P>Third, reporting signals a company’s seriousness about <mark>climate change</mark> and provides a gauge of its ability to track and manage emissions. That capability is seen by many observers, including Wall Street analysts, as a proxy for good environmental management, which studies show correlates with good general management and superior stock market performance over time. Reporting is similarly seen as a measure of corporate trustworthiness and good governance.</P><P>Fourth, financial markets are beginning to recognize that inattention to greenhouse gas emissions may soon have real cost and risk implications. Last spring more than 50 U.S. investors with a combined total of $4 trillion under management called on the U.S. Congress to enact legislation to curb <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. In a statement, the signatories, including investment funds for labor unions, state pensions, insurance companies, and major asset managers, wrote, “In the current unpredictable national <mark>climate policy</mark> environment, it is exceedingly difficult and risky for businesses to evaluate and justify the large-scale, long-term capital investments needed to seize existing and emerging opportunities….” Dozens of funds now screen companies for environmental and sustainability factors, including emissions reporting, and exclude poor performers. In July, for example, Citigroup downgraded coal stocks across the board, explaining in an equity research report that “[coal] company productivity/margins are likely to be structurally impaired by new regulatory mandates applied to a group perceived as landscape-disfiguring global warming bad-guys.” Meanwhile, the number of environmental resolutions before shareholders in the 2007 U.S. proxy season set record highs, led by demands to address <mark>climate</mark> risks.</P><P>With the United States moving toward regulating emissions and Europe already imposing greenhouse gas limits, large companies that don’t report are assumed to have high emissions. They’re thus considered to be exposed to forthcoming <mark>carbon</mark> charges, as well as to current high energy costs, risks that could undermine their competitiveness. Meanwhile, companies that track greenhouse gases closely and report results appear better positioned to undertake serious emissions-control efforts and to minimize the consequences of new regulatory requirements.</P><P>Indeed, when buyout powerhouses KKR and Texas Pacific Group made a deal to acquire TXU, the big Dallas-based utility, they changed little except the company’s plan to build 11 new coal-fired power plants, cutting that number to three. The private equity firms concluded that investing in coal today when <mark>carbon</mark> emissions were sure to be costly in the future made little sense. A broader trend here is worth noting: In 2006, TXU’s stock price suffered after Environmental Defense activists launched a campaign opposing the coal plants, which made the company vulnerable. The prospect of takeover by powerful private equity groups is likely to force a discipline on any company that fails to calculate its <mark>carbon</mark> exposure and adjust its strategy accordingly.</P><P>Beyond responding to stakeholder pressures, careful tracking and management of emissions prepares companies to manage <mark>climate change</mark> challenges systematically. Those who fail to monitor, report, and mitigate emissions face the prospect of mounting competitive disadvantage. </P><DIV class=""special-body""><P><STRONG>Daniel C.

So why do it? We explored that question with Alyson Slater, the director of strategy at Global Reporting Initiative, an Amsterdam-based organization that has developed the most widely used framework of reporting principles, guidance, and standard disclosures on environmental, social, and economic performance. 
 </P><P><STRONG>Why should businesses care about voluntary reporting on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions?</STRONG></P><P>It’s the fiduciary duty of any company to ask, Is this issue important to our stakeholders? Today it is very difficult for a company to say that greenhouse gas emissions are not a subject of material interest to stakeholders. If you’re a supplier to Wal-Mart, you have to answer yes. If you’re in the oil and gas business, you have to answer yes. If you’re a company looking for good access to capital markets, where more and more investment firms are considering <mark>climate change</mark> impact as part of a company’s risk profile, you have to answer yes. Whatever sector or business you’re in, disclosure is increasingly expected, and failure to disclose can put you at a strategic disadvantage.</P><P><STRONG>How does the reporting process help a company address <mark>climate</mark>-related risks?</STRONG></P><P>Companies quickly realize that reporting can’t happen without strategy development. As firms start the process of putting a report together—talking to stakeholders, examining core businesses—they’ll have to back up and ask, What is our strategy on <mark>climate change</mark> anyway? What is our approach to managing this risk? The discipline of sorting out which activities are material to report on and in what depth, and what data will be used to document progress, forces companies to formulate strategies. For companies that haven’t been engaged in <mark>climate change</mark> and need to catch up with competitors that are disclosing, the reporting process is a stimulus for opening up a dialogue with stakeholders about the issue.</P><P>Just as important, the report serves as an accountability mechanism. It allows a company to make commitments and show through performance that it is doing what it said it would do. If you think about the “plan, do, check, act” cycle of corporate management, reporting provides the check: Here are our goals; here’s the system we’ve put in place. Now let’s see how we’re progressing and where we need to readjust.</P><P><STRONG>Aren’t disclosures of potential trouble areas risky?</STRONG></P><P>Companies’ natural instinct, which we’ve seen across the board, is to avoid public disclosure on potential risks, whether it’s greenhouse gas emissions or something else. But we’ve also seen how reporting creates a communications avenue through which companies can effectively and accurately position themselves with their stakeholders—investors, customers, regulators, and so on. You can’t walk through an airport in Europe, for example, without seeing a BP poster for its “Beyond Petroleum” campaign. In this initiative, BP draws on hard facts from its reporting process as it works to shape the <mark>carbon</mark>-emissions debate and position itself as a leader in renewable energy sources. It’s using report data—this is not greenwashing—to demonstrate its nimbleness as a company to adapt to emerging risks and be on the cutting edge of new opportunities.</P><P><STRONG>From a governance standpoint, how much weight should information from the reporting process carry?</STRONG></P><P>It’s a primary responsibility of the board and the CEO to determine the implications of their company’s future <mark>climate</mark> risks and (a) report them and (b) mitigate them. Companies are adept at assessing their financial performance, but too many are afraid to look in the mirror and face potential risks that could damage their business. Directors want to know that a company will be as competitive over time as it is in the short run. That requires looking beyond the quarterly financial results. Financial reporting of course allows you to understand only a certain slice of a company’s true market capitalization. Consider Coca-Cola: 20% of its market cap can be attributed to its book value, that is, its hard assets. Eighty percent of its value is attributed to intangibles—brand, R&amp;D, risk management, ability to innovate in a globalizing and resource-constrained world—all things that are not captured in a financial statement. Sustainability reporting focuses squarely on those areas, which businesses traditionally have not done a good job of understanding and managing.</P><P>—Christina Bortz</P><H2>Regulation: If You’re Not at the Table, You’re on the Menu</H2><H4>by Andrew J. Hoffman</H4><P>When the companies of the United States <mark>Climate</mark> Action Partnership (USCAP)—businesses including GE, Alcoa, DuPont, and PG&amp;E—announced their call for federal standards on greenhouse gas emissions in January 2007, the <EM>Wall Street Journal</EM> castigated these “jolly green giants” for acting in their own self-interest in promoting a regulatory program “designed to financially reward companies that reduce <mark>CO2</mark> emissions, and punish those that don’t.” But seeking advantage is what companies do. Any company that can foresee business opportunities in influencing <mark>carbon</mark>-emissions regulation is practicing what is expected of business managers—capitalism.</P><P>Indeed, any company that sits on the sidelines as policy is formulated is recklessly playing the bystander to a significant shift in its market environment. <mark>Carbon</mark>-emissions regulation will burden certain companies, industries, and sectors more than others, and, likewise, will deliver advantage unevenly. Regulatory policy will set the rules of the game that affect how that burden will fall and how advantage will be delivered. It’s time to plot how you’ll respond.</P><P>At a minimum, all companies should know their <mark>carbon</mark> footprint—where their emissions are coming from and in what amounts (this may include understanding suppliers’ footprints, too). At the next level, they can take steps to reduce emissions and calculate the costs per ton to make those reductions. The most advanced companies can parlay that experience into an advisory role with governments, gaining a seat at the table when regulations are designed. BP and Shell, for example, became savvy <mark>carbon</mark>-emissions traders in advance of any requirements, allowing them to become advisers to policy makers in the European Union.</P><P>Companies that hope to participate in policy making need to know the answers to two questions: First, what’s on the table (what are the regulatory issues at stake)? And second, where is the table (where are standards being developed)?</P><P><STRONG>What’s on the table?</STRONG> To shape policy to your advantage, you must start by monitoring pending regulations and understanding how they may affect your business objectives. That requires being knowledgeable about the relevant language and issues. Here’s a quiz:</P><UL><LI>Do you understand how cap-and-trade programs work or how <mark>carbon</mark> taxes might be applied? Do you know which of the possible programs under discussion would best serve your company’s interests?</LI></UL><UL><LI>Do you have good intelligence on how <mark>carbon</mark>-emissions permits will be allocated, whether there will be economy-wide or sector-based standards, whether deeper reductions will be expected from upstream or from downstream industries, whether there will be a “safety valve” above which emission prices will not go, and what emissions will be counted (direct, indirect, or both)?</LI></UL><UL><LI>Do you know the difference between renewable energy credits, verified emission reductions, certified emission reductions, emission reduction units, and European Union allowances? Do you know how to make deals under the Clean Development Mechanism and the Joint Implementation?</LI></UL><P>If your company doesn’t know the answers, you’re probably ill-prepared to participate in policy development and already missing out on the fast-growing <mark>carbon</mark>-trading market—one that roughly tripled from $11 billion globally in 2005 to $30 billion in 2006.</P><P><STRONG>Where is the table?</STRONG> <mark>Climate</mark>-related standards are being set at the state, national, and international levels. Which will become the dominant standard? Answering that question tells you which table to sit at but requires making a calculated guess among an array of possibilities.</P><P>For example, a company in the New England region of the United States might focus on shaping local policy in the near term and become involved in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States. On the West Coast, a company could lobby the California Air Resources Board as it develops mandatory emissions-reporting rules. Or a U.S. company could lobby in the 47 states that, according to a July 2007 report, had begun to inventory emissions, developed renewal portfolio standards and <mark>climate</mark> action plans, or committed to a cap-and-trade system. Thinking more broadly, the firm could lobby at the federal level on one of the more than 100 <mark>climate</mark>-related bills making their way toward a vote.

The problem is that the buying spree, meant to burnish companies’ green credentials, may end up tarnishing them.</P><P>Consider this: In January 2006, Whole Foods announced the purchase of renewable energy certificates (RECs) representing the production of 458,000 megawatt hours’ (MWh) worth of green electricity but was soon trumped by Wells Fargo, which bought 550,000 worth. Then Pepsi surged ahead last April with an unprecedented 1.1 million MWh REC purchase. The companies trumpeted their purchases with claims that they “offset” or, in effect, neutralized some of their <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. I made similar claims when my own company purchased RECs. 
 </P><P>Anytime there’s a feeding frenzy, you have to ask, What’s so tasty? Why are businesses falling over one another to buy these pieces of paper? Printed by producers of energy each time they generate clean electricity—and then sold to hungry buyers—the certificates merely symbolize green energy. (For more, see the box “How Do Renewable Energy Certificates Work?”) </P><ARTICLE-SIDEBAR class=""article-sidebar sidebar--half"" data-sidebar-alternate=""sidebar""><H4 class=""sidebar-title"">How Do Renewable Energy Certificates Work?</H4><DIV class=""sidebar-contents height--collapse""><P>When a wind turbine or solar panel generates a megawatt hour of electricity (a little more than an American home uses each month, on average), that clean, <mark>carbon</mark>-emission-free electricity flows into the utility grid, where it combines with “dirty” electricity produced by fossil-fuel power plants. The producer of that megawatt hour of clean electricity is allowed to print and sell one renewable energy certificate (REC), representing that quantity of clean electricity. People or organizations can buy that REC, regardless of where they get their electricity or how dirty it is, and claim that their purchase neutralizes some of the <mark>carbon</mark> emissions created by their electricity use. Of course, it has done no such thing. The problem is that most RECs are merely pieces of paper documenting the generation of electricity by wind farms or other green producers. Such cheap RECs don’t cause clean electricity to be made; they’re an afterthought printed up to bring in additional revenue. As such, most don’t actually offset the buyer’s <mark>carbon</mark> emissions or reduce the amount of <mark>carbon</mark> put into the air.</P></DIV></ARTICLE-SIDEBAR><P>Most businesses will say they’re buying RECs because they care about the environment and <mark>climate change</mark>. Fair enough. But for many, buying RECs is a relatively inexpensive way to make a powerful brand-positioning statement. In one stroke, a business can don the environmental mantle, seemingly legitimately and at an affordable price, without having to directly and expensively do anything to reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. Certainly, corporate reputations have been enhanced by large REC purchases.</P><P>The danger in buying RECs is that the mainstream press has begun to challenge claims about their environmental value. Articles have appeared in publications including <EM>BusinessWeek</EM> and the <EM>Financial Times</EM> pointing out that most RECs don’t actually offset emissions, and the skepticism is spreading across the Internet. Indeed, most RECs don’t result in the creation of clean electricity, which would have been generated anyway, whether or not an REC was printed. As consumers become increasingly savvy about evaluating companies’ environmental claims, businesses that tout REC purchases may expose themselves to charges of greenwashing.</P><P>A report released in 2006 by an environmental organization called Clean Air–Cool Planet was among the first to rigorously examine the environmental impact of RECs. The report found that while most RECs don’t lead to <mark>carbon</mark>-emissions reductions, a minority do, by directly helping to finance, say, the construction of a new wind farm. Companies that buy RECs and want to avoid charges of greenwashing should seek out these higher-quality and more costly certificates, whose purchase directly and demonstrably helps reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions.</P><P>RECs, supporters argue, create a market mechanism that spurs the development of new wind, solar, and other green-electricity plants. As demand for RECs grows, their prices will rise, encouraging developers to build more renewable power facilities that can generate income through increasingly profitable sales of the certificates. Unfortunately, because there has been such a surplus of cheap RECs—and no easy way to distinguish between high- and low-quality offerings—the market mechanism has remained stalled for the most part. If companies, mindful of their reputations, reject inferior RECs and begin demanding quality ones, that could jump-start the production of renewable electricity and actually reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. Corporate scrutiny and activism might even foster the development of a badly needed tool that could clean up the entire REC industry in one masterstroke: a third-party gold standard for REC quality. </P><DIV class=""special-body""><P><STRONG>Auden Schendler</STRONG> (<A href=""mailto:aschendler@aspensnowmass.com"">aschendler@aspensnowmass.com</A>) is the executive director of community and environmental responsibility at Aspen Skiing in Colorado.</P></DIV><H2>Balance Sheet: Accounting for <mark>Climate Change</mark>: A Window on the Future</H2><H4>by Vicki Bakhshi and Alexis Krajeski</H4><P>How will the prospect of <mark>climate change</mark> affect your business over the medium term?</P><P>To answer that question, we’ve dreamed up a 2010 consolidated balance sheet for a fictional company. We’ve also imagined that the statement’s notes would detail the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> on the firm’s fortunes.</P><P>The company, based in the southern United States, is a medium-size manufacturer (9,000 employees) that sells electrical components to businesses and, through retailers, lightbulbs and batteries to consumers—a company that in some ways is on the front lines of <mark>climate change</mark>. To highlight the possible effects of <mark>climate</mark>-related severe weather, we’ve imagined that the firm was directly affected by the devastating hurricane season of 2005 and is still dealing with the aftereffects. 
 </P><P>To focus specifically on <mark>climate</mark>, we’ve had to leave a great deal out of the statement. We’ve concentrated on the three areas most likely to be affected: product portfolios, property assets, and long-term liabilities. Look for the impact on those areas in the explanatory notes. </P><DIV class=""exhibit""><P><SPAN class=""exhibit-title"">Consolidated Balance Sheet</SPAN></P></DIV><P><STRONG>Notes on the 2010 Consolidated Balance Sheet</STRONG></P><P>The Company’s new strategy, unveiled in 2007, capitalizes on the opportunities created by the sharp rise in energy costs and focuses on developing a full range of energy-efficient electrical products. A cornerstone of this strategy is the recently completed acquisition of Malcolm &amp; Angus, an electrical engineering and design firm with an outstanding track record in this area. The acquisition brings new capabilities, forward-looking thinking, and valuable patents to the Company. In addition, the acquisition will help us attract capital from firms seeking green-oriented investments.</P><H3>Assets</H3><P><STRONG>Cash and cash equivalents</STRONG></P><P>In response to rising market demand for energy-saving components and lighting solutions, the Company has shifted to a high-efficiency product portfolio that in 2010 generated strong profit growth. Cash balances rose sharply as a consequence of strong demand from Wal-Mart and other large retail customers, in particular for our high-efficiency compact fluorescent lighting products. However, the rise in cash was tempered by a steep increase in insurance premiums in the wake of the claims we filed for severe damage to our Biloxi, Mississippi, facilities as a result of the 2005 hurricane season.</P><P><STRONG>Accounts receivable</STRONG></P><P>Our new energy-efficient product portfolio has enabled us to expand our retail distribution network, leading to a rise in accounts receivable from natural-foods supermarkets, where our solar rechargeable batteries are a top seller. 
 </P><P><STRONG>Property and equipment</STRONG></P><P>Our Biloxi facility never fully recovered after the 2005 hurricane season, and it was finally closed in 2010, triggering a $38 million write-down to the property account. Our Corpus Christi, Texas, site has been upgraded to ensure greater wind and flood resistance. We also installed highly efficient HVAC and sensory lighting systems, which will reduce our energy costs, but had to retire our existing HVAC system early, triggering a write-down of $10 million.</P><P>In 2008, the Company designed its new Atlanta headquarters to meet the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum standard for environmentally <mark>sustainable</mark> buildings. Although the building had slightly higher up-front costs, the introduction of the U.S. cap-and-trade system for <mark>carbon</mark> emissions has, as expected, resulted in a sharp appreciation in the property’s market value. This has enabled us to obtain a long-term loan to fund the acquisition of Malcolm &amp; Angus that was collateralized by the property, thereby resulting in an increase to long-term assets. We have also announced the phased closure of our now-uneconomic operations in Nashville, Tennessee, and Pensacola, Florida, resulting in 370 job losses and a write-down in plant and equipment of $62 million. We recently purchased a facility in Mexico, where planned efficiency improvements will generate <mark>carbon</mark> savings that will earn Clean Development Mechanism credits under the new UN rules.</P><P><STRONG>Tax credits</STRONG></P><P>The 15 wind turbines the Company installed on part of its Corpus Christi site in 2007 are now fully operational and generated surplus electricity that was exported to the grid, thereby earning a production tax credit.</P><P><STRONG>Intangibles</STRONG></P><P>In acquiring Malcolm &amp; Angus, the Company paid five times book value, recording $59 million in goodwill.</P><H3>Liabilities</H3><P><STRONG>Accounts payable</STRONG></P><P>Accounts payable rose because of a generalized growth in trading volumes, as well as the more generous payment terms we have negotiated with our suppliers of incandescent lightbulbs. With the ban on sales of incandescent lightbulbs already in effect in Australia and going into effect in parts of Canada and elsewhere in coming years, the Company is phasing out in-house manufacture but will still supply incandescents to customers. Accordingly, outsourcing of incandescents lifted accounts payable by $5 million.</P><P><STRONG>Pension liabilities</STRONG></P><P>The Company’s pension investments, which were heavily exposed to several coal-burning U.S. electric utilities, suffered serious losses because of the newly enacted cap-and-trade system. We dismissed our fund managers and replaced them with new managers who are signatories to the UN Principles for Responsible Investment and who actively consider <mark>climate change</mark> as part of the investment process. Actuarial projections indicate that the Company must contribute $21 million to the pension plan within the next three years. This has been deferred to allow the pension fund to record an immediate $11 million adjustment arising from the closure of the Biloxi plant.</P><P><STRONG>Commitments and contingencies</STRONG></P><P>In the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2007 ruling that greenhouse gases can be considered pollutants under the Clean Air Act, our lawyers have advised us that it would be in shareholders’ interest to negotiate a settlement with the Environmental Protection Agency to resolve any future liability for historical emissions <mark>pollution</mark>. The settlement is expected to reflect the significant investments the Company has already made to bring its operations in line with best practice, thereby reducing current emissions to a minimum.</P><P>Strategic change inevitably poses risks, and there may be unforeseen developments in the markets we are entering. Nevertheless, the Company’s senior management team believes it has developed a strategic plan that manages those risks effectively and positions the Company to capture the growth opportunities that we expect will arise as it adjusts to the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> in its core market. </P><DIV class=""special-body""><P><STRONG>Vicki Bakhshi</STRONG> (<A href=""mailto:vicki.bakhshi@fandc.com"">vicki.bakhshi@fandc.com</A>) and <STRONG>Alexis Krajeski</STRONG> (<A href=""mailto:alexis.krajeski@fandc.com"">alexis.krajeski@fandc.com</A>) are members of the Governance and <mark>Sustainable</mark> Investment team at F&amp;C Investments, a London-based asset management group.</P></DIV><H2>Markets: Investors Hunger for Clean Energy</H2><H4>by Theodore Roosevelt IV and John Llewellyn</H4><P>Demand is surging among investors, both professional and private, for business ideas that will take advantage of changing views and regulations on greenhouse gases. Because currently there are not enough good projects to jump into, however, it remains largely unmet.</P><P>Investors have been waking up to the opportunities of the new environmental era over the past several years. Institutions were among the first to put money into <mark>sustainable</mark> energy companies. Lately, hedge funds—some of which had already entered this space—have aggressively increased their pursuit of environmental investments. And there has been overwhelming demand from private equity investors and wealthy individuals. 
 </P><P>Worldwide investments in <mark>sustainable</mark> energy (including wind, solar, and water power) more than doubled from 2004 to 2006, to $70.9 billion, according to a 2007 report by the United Nations Environment Programme and the firm New Energy Finance. Venture capital and private equity investments in <mark>sustainable</mark> energy increased by 69% in 2006, to $8.6 billion.</P><P>Virtually any firm in any sector can reap the benefits of investors’ growing interest in <mark>climate change</mark>. Companies that make or sell energy technologies, hybrid cars, insulation products, or any of the thousands of other <mark>climate</mark>-related products and services have an obvious edge in attracting green capital. However, corporate operations almost always generate greenhouse gases, and investors assume that a price on those emissions is inevitable. If a company can show that it has diversified its energy sources to include those that produce little or no emissions and that it has shrunk its per-employee power use, the capital markets will respond favorably.</P><P>Another way to attract green investment money is to acquire or take a stake in companies that specialize in clean tech. Wall Street firms have taken this approach, investing in renewable energy companies.</P><P>Still, most investors have been unable to find suitable green initiatives. A recent survey showed that fewer than 20% of investors had alternative-energy-focused investments, despite strong interest in this space. To us, that indicates a lack of green investments that meet investors’ requirements.</P><P>There are several reasons why the demand for green investments outstrips the supply. Many of the investors who are most intensely interested in <mark>climate change</mark> don’t want to dilute their investments by putting money into diversified companies—they want their investments to go directly to green technologies or strategies. On the other hand, the diversified companies that have good green businesses, such as solar energy units, often do not want to spin them off because they want to experience all the potential gains they see in those businesses.</P><P>The desire for green investments is so intense, and the supply currently so limited, that if investors aren’t disciplined, the excess demand could cause a bubble in the future. If such a bubble formed and then burst, the markets might conclude, erroneously, that investing in <mark>climate</mark> initiatives isn’t a good idea. But so far that is not what we are seeing. Our interactions with fund managers indicate that the good hedge funds and private equity firms are doing what they’ve always done when approaching an investment—digging down into the details and performing their due diligence.</P><P>This is why companies have to go about attracting green capital the right way, because even in this new <mark>carbon</mark>-conscious era, serious investors are continuing to apply all the old rules: The firms they invest in must have good management, be able to execute initiatives well, and be able to make money.</P><P>The pricing of greenhouse gas emissions will create an economic transformation of the first order, with the potential to be even larger than globalization. Investors now recognize that the impact on the world and national economies will be enormous. The companies that will be the most successful in attracting green capital will be those that share investors’ view of the importance of this change. Investors will not expect all companies to be experts in climatology, but they will expect every company to see and understand a trend of this magnitude and make sure the firm does not get left behind.

At Masisa, the $886 million forestry and wood-manufacturing company in Chile where I oversee social and environmental responsibility, a key part of our strategy is to engage business-to-business customers in our efforts to become greener. Because the forestry industry faces growing criticism in Latin America and worldwide regarding its impact on the environment, it makes strategic sense for Masisa to differentiate itself in the marketplace not only by reducing its <mark>carbon</mark> footprint but also by helping others to reduce theirs. So we’re conducting an experiment with our B2B customers: We’re telling them what we’re doing to address <mark>climate change</mark> and advising them on their efforts, with the double goal of positioning Masisa as a leader in <mark>carbon</mark> reduction and capitalizing on our enhanced reputation.</P><P>According to our market research, our products’ final consumers—people who are remodeling their kitchens or buying new furniture—consider a company’s impact on the environment to be their second priority, right behind product design and durability, when they make purchases. (Three years ago they didn’t even include it among their top ten concerns.) So it stands to reason that the businesses directly serving those customers would want to forge—and publicize—strong relationships with the suppliers that have set the most aggressive <mark>carbon</mark>-reduction targets. To show how serious we are about reducing emissions, we have joined the Chicago <mark>Climate</mark> Exchange, which requires us to commit to a 6% decrease by 2010 (measured from a baseline established from 1998 to 2001). The steps we are taking to reach that goal include planting rapid-growth trees such as pine and eucalyptus in our forests to capture <mark>carbon</mark> from the atmosphere, burning biomass (sawdust and wood chips left over from sawing and manufacturing) to generate two-thirds of our energy, using combustion gases from thermal plants and boilers as fuel, and optimizing distances between equipment and work areas to decrease overall energy consumption.</P><P>Masisa sells its wood boards through Placacentros franchise stores, where carpenters buy what they need to build furniture and to do more extensive work on homes and commercial buildings. There are some 300 Placacentros stores in Latin America, and Masisa is inviting its business partners, the franchisees, to help improve the <mark>carbon</mark> footprint of its value chain. We start by providing them with basic education, mainly workshops that cover the fundamentals of <mark>climate change</mark>. Then we suggest ways to identify emission sources and offer ideas for tracking and reduction. Additionally, we demonstrate that certain improvements—such as skylights and energy-efficient equipment—will lower costs. We are also planning to give the Placacentros marketing materials to share with their customers; these will describe the benefits of using wood instead of cement and steel, for instance, which require more energy to produce and are nonrenewable.</P><P>Although it is still too early to say how much of an impact our experiment with B2B customers is making directly on revenues, we see signs that it is deepening customer loyalty. This year, as we have renegotiated our franchise agreements, many of our partners have granted us preferred supplier status. They’re telling us it’s because they value the support that Masisa gives them in <mark>carbon</mark> reduction and other areas where they may be struggling, and because they want to be associated with a brand that is recognized for environmental responsibility as well as product quality and design. </P><DIV class=""special-body""><P><STRONG>Maria Emilia Correa</STRONG> (<A href=""mailto:info@masisa.com"">info@masisa.com</A>) is the corporate officer for social and environmental responsibility at Masisa, a forestry and wood-manufacturing company in Santiago, Chile.</P></DIV><H2>Leadership: Walking the Talk at Swiss Re</H2><H4>by Mark Way and Britta Rendlen</H4><P>Internal programs to coax employees to reduce their <mark>carbon</mark> footprints are getting to be commonplace among consumer-facing companies: Clif Bar, Patagonia, Timberland, Google, and Bank of America, to name a few. But is there a business reason why such an initiative might benefit a company that <EM>can’t</EM> derive consumer-loyalty dividends from it?</P><P>Swiss Re, an insurer of insurers that is largely unknown to the public, has put its money and muscle behind an incentive program to persuade employees to do such things as drive hybrid cars, use energy-efficient appliances, and install solar panels. The strategic reasons: The company believes that the potentially catastrophic effects of <mark>climate change</mark> pose a major risk to its industry and its customers, and is committed to combating it. The employee initiative reinforces the firm’s essential message to stakeholders, aligns employees’ actions with company priorities, and shows, to put it simply, that Swiss Re walks the talk.</P><P>The COYou2 Reduce and Gain program, which also includes educational initiatives such as Lunch &amp; Learn sessions for employees, is an outgrowth of Swiss Re’s almost two-decade-long focus on the risks of <mark>climate change</mark>. The company’s four-part <mark>climate</mark> strategy consists of understanding the risks, developing new products and services to address them, raising risk awareness, and reducing Swiss Re’s own <mark>carbon</mark> footprint. The latter point has as much relevance as the others: The company would hardly be perceived as a leader in the <mark>climate change</mark> debate if it did not keep its own house in order. Fostering the company’s credibility is crucial because of the central role that trust plays in its business model.</P><P>Back in 2003, Swiss Re became the first major financial services provider to pledge to become greenhouse neutral. Swiss Re plans to meet that goal by 2013 through reducing the company’s emissions by 15% per employee and offsetting the remainder with investments in the World Bank’s Community Development <mark>Carbon</mark> Fund. COYou2 furthers that commitment by encouraging employees to do their part. 
 </P><P>The program, launched by CEO Jacques Aigrain in early 2007 and scheduled to run through 2011, is available to employees in 25 countries who have been with the company for at least two years. The company reimburses employees up to 50% for a range of investments made for their personal use. The minimum reimbursement amount is CHF 500, and the cap is CHF 5,000 per employee. (The amounts in other currencies are similar but are adjusted to the local cost of living.) As of June 2007, more than 2.5% of all eligible Swiss Re employees had participated. </P><DIV class=""special-body""><P><STRONG>Mark Way</STRONG>, based in Armonk, New York, is the head of Sustainability Issue Management &amp; Reporting at Swiss Re and part of the company’s Sustainability &amp; Emerging Risk Management unit. <STRONG>Britta Rendlen</STRONG>, based in Zurich, is a senior sustainability adviser with that unit and the project manager of COYou2 Reduce and Gain.</P></DIV><H2>Opinion: Place Your Bets on the Future You Want</H2><H4>by Forest L. Reinhardt</H4><P>Which firms will gain and which will lose as governments and businesses begin to take <mark>climate change</mark> seriously? Corporate balance sheets provide a few clues: As greenhouse gas emissions get costlier, the relative value of such assets as natural gas, which produces less <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide than coal when burned, will increase. Other clues can be found in firms’ current efforts to reduce emissions: A company’s ability to analyze the trade-offs inherent in initiatives such as cutting overall transportation distances will become highly valuable in a world where the right to emit greenhouse gases is limited.</P><P>Ultimately, though, success in a <mark>carbon</mark>-constrained world will be determined not by short-term balance sheet effects or efficiency initiatives but by <mark>innovation</mark>, management acumen, and leadership. The companies that have seized the big opportunities in changing economic landscapes have been those with bold visions of the future, not necessarily those whose hard assets seemed to position them best for success. Think of Toyota and Wal-Mart. No one could have guessed merely by looking at Toyota’s balance sheet in the 1940s or Wal-Mart’s in the 1960s that those firms would so successfully capitalize on globalization.</P><P>The firms that come out ahead when emissions cost money will be those that make bold moves now, refocusing strategy and operations to take advantage of the opportunities and skirt the dangers raised by the prospect of <mark>climate change</mark>. Taking bold steps doesn’t just mean chasing after what are sometimes touted as “win-win” solutions, such as quick-payback investments in energy efficiency. Moves like that are obviously necessary, but they aren’t enough by themselves. Companies need to get past the win-win rhetoric and move on to the tough trade-offs.</P><P>Many of the <mark>climate</mark>-related investments a company might make won’t pay for themselves until some other firm is making complementary investments. Alternative-fuel cars need a refueling infrastructure. Specialized facilities that liquefy natural gas for transoceanic shipment are valuable only if there are terminals for off-loading the cargo and turning it back into gas at the other end. And many <mark>carbon</mark>-reducing investments won’t deliver shareholder value until governments act to make emissions expensive.</P><P>For centuries, the North Atlantic cod fishery fed millions of people, but there were no property rights controlling access to fish in the sea, so fishermen didn’t treat the resource as scarce. In the early 1990s, the fishery collapsed. Governments have since established sensible systems of tradable catch permits that seem likely to prevent the collapse of other species, but it was apparently too late to resurrect the cod fishery. The atmosphere’s ability to absorb emissions is now similarly limited, precisely because we thought that could never happen. A system in which we pretend that <mark>carbon</mark> emissions cost nothing subsidizes, at our children’s expense, every producer and consumer of energy today. To be efficient, we need to eliminate those subsidies. That means pricing <mark>carbon</mark>.</P><P>Business leaders must be courageous in betting on the long-term future that will benefit their companies the most—that is, on a future where governments constrain, in transparent and reasonable ways, the human impact on the <mark>climate</mark>. Firms can invest now and participate in voluntary interfirm trading systems to develop expertise in them and show governments, regulators, and the business community how robust such systems can be. Companies can also lobby for governments to implement sensible systems that tax <mark>carbon</mark> emissions or that cap them and encourage the trading of <mark>carbon</mark> credits. By betting on the future they want, corporations will make that future all the more likely. Prudent businesspeople may balk at the idea that they should stick their necks out and, in some cases, act unilaterally on <mark>climate change</mark>. But their necks are already exposed. The status quo will not persist. Inertia and incrementalism amount to big (and risky) bets too—bets that the future won’t be much different from the present.</P><P>After World War II, the Americans advised Japanese companies to concentrate on labor-intensive, low-value products in which Japan was said to have an advantage. Instead, the Japanese invested in producing capital-intensive, income-elastic goods such as automobiles and electronic equipment, believing that a critical mass of consumers would eventually get rich enough to buy those products. Had the firms bet wrong, the strategy would have failed. But had they not taken bold steps toward the future they wanted, Japan would have remained poor no matter how the world economy evolved. 
 </P><P>Companies that might derive short-term benefits from subsidies—for corn-based ethanol, for example, or wind-powered electricity—will be tempted to lobby for them, and the government will undoubtedly find it politically easier to pile subsidy on subsidy rather than tax emissions or establish a coherent cap-and-trade system. But subsidies won’t fix the <mark>climate</mark> problem, and any business in which subsidies drive profits is not healthy or <mark>sustainable</mark>. Strong business leaders should want a transparent system that prices the right to generate <mark>carbon</mark> emissions as though it were any other scarce resource and lets firms get on with the business of competing. </P><DIV class=""special-body""><P><STRONG>Forest L.

Meanwhile, the story of technology in food was being told people who were not knowledgeable, who didn’t have the facts and “sometimes had a different agenda.”</P><P>Khan, an endocrinologist by training, specifically called on USDA to take a more active role in dealing with some of the most persistent problems facing agriculture, like citrus greening, which he noted had destroyed roughly half of Florida’s orange crop over the past decade. Yet Khan said he’s seen little progress in countering the disease over that 10-year period.</P><P>USDA, he said, should use its convening power to bring all parties involved together in a pre-competitive setting – growers, start-ups, academics and others, including PepsiCo, which owns Tropicana, the largest orange juice brand – to try to turn the corner on citrus greening.</P><P>“If this was a human epidemic we would convene everybody,” he said, “and yet we haven’t done that.”</P><P>Khan cited the <A href=""https://midwestrowcrop.org/"">Midwest Row Crop Collaborative</A> as an example of what such a “convening” might look like. The initiative has brought together major companies including PepsiCo, Cargill, Monsanto, McDonald’s and Walmart with government representatives from Iowa, Illinois and Nebraska and environmental groups such as the Nature Conservancy and the World Wildlife Fund in an effort to improve soil and water quality in the Upper Mississippi basin.</P><P>Khan ended his address by praising USDA for figuring out how to codify and implement the work of <A href=""https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1970/borlaug-bio.html"">Norman Borlaug</A>, the American agronomist known as the Father of the Green Revolution whose work, he said, has saved an estimated billion lives, “more than any human being in the history of mankind.”</P><P>“Nobody has done this better than this agency,” he said, referring to USDA.</P><P>#30</P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Doritos even hosts a highly publicized contest for customers to submit their own commercial and have it broadcast during the game. But this year, days before the Super Bowl is actually played, a parody Doritos commercial has gone viral. It's billed as &quot;The Ad Doritos Doesn't Want You To See.&quot; It's a funny look at a very serious issue.The video has more than 12 million views online and was created by a global organization called <A href=""http://sumofus.org/"">SumOfUs</A>. The company's executive director, Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman, is based in San Francisco.&quot;This campaign has taken off like no other campaign we've done,&quot; she said. The video features a couple falling in love over their shared love of Doritos, getting married, then off to a honeymoon at a tropical rainforest. They arrive to find the forest has been mowed down to plant palm oil trees.  <A href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPlxNhEc2lA"">Tap here to view on News app</A>The spoof is aimed at Doritos' parent company PepsiCo, which buys more than 400,000 tons of palm oil a year.&quot;Palm oil is one of the biggest contributors to deforestation, which is one of the biggest drivers of <mark>climate change</mark>,&quot; Stinebrickner-Kauffman said.Palm oil is now the most widely used vegetable oil in the world, and is in about half of all the packaged products in your grocery store. That includes many cookies, chocolates, peanut butter, soap, lotion, even lipstick. Sometimes palm oil is clearly labeled, but it can be listed under dozens of different names. The demand for palm oil has exploded because it's cheap, the trees grow fast, and the oil does not contain trans fats. Some call it a miracle crop. But palm oil can have a dark side.&quot;It's connected to massive scale human rights violations and environmental destruction across the world,&quot; said Laurel Sutherlin with the <A href=""http://www.ran.org/"">Rainforest Action Network</A>.The Bay Area-based company shared their video of serious destruction in Indonesia.&quot;These are some of the most biologically diverse forests in the world and they are just being cleared, tens of thousands of acres at a time to put in these long rows of palm trees that then just become biological deserts,&quot; Sutherlin said. &quot;And so we have species like the orangutan that have really been pushed right to the brink of extinction.&quot;Stanford Professor Lisa Curran has been studying the effect of palm oil plantations over the past 20 years on the ground and using NASA satellite images. One shows the heavy smoke believed to be coming from thousands of fires to clear land for palm oil trees.&quot;Man, it's bad,&quot; she said. &quot;The clearing just from the Indonesian part of Borneo alone was the emissions equivalent to all the automobiles in Canada.&quot;Several big companies, including PepsiCo, have joined a <A href=""http://abc7ne.ws/164qdEr"">Roundtable on <mark>Sustainable</mark> Palm Oil</A> to work to make sure the crop is grown responsibly in the future.But progress is slow and environmental groups are demanding corporations to do more to save rain forests before it's too late.&quot;It's totally doable,&quot; Stinebrickner-Kauffman said. &quot;Big companies like Kellogg's, like Mars, like Nestle have already put in place the policies we are asking for. All we are asking is for Pepsi to do the same.&quot;PepsiCo says it is committed to using <mark>sustainable</mark> palm oil. A spokesperson would not speak on camera. Instead, they sent a copy of their palm oil policy. PepsiCo insists it is committed to using <mark>sustainable</mark> palm oil. A spokesperson would not speak on camera, but sent a statement. <I>&quot;SumOfUs' continual mischaracterizations of our palm oil commitments are patently false and run counter to the positive reception our policies have received from expert organizations in this arena. PepsiCo has repeatedly stated that we are absolutely committed to 100% <mark>sustainable</mark> palm oil in 2015 and to zero deforestation in our activities and sourcing. This latest public relations stunt, focused on fiction rather than facts, does nothing to foster positive dialogue or affect positive change. We find our policies effective and stand by them.&quot;</I>But activists are not giving up. Now the Rainforest Action Network is launching a new campaign focusing on Quaker Granola Bars, also owned by Pepsi.<I>Written and produced by Jennifer Olney</I></DIV><DIV class=""story-taxonomy""><STRONG>Related Topics:</STRONG></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

Rather, they’re all-too-real interludes from a sprawling global jaunt to sound the alarm on an escalating crisis.</P><P>The actor and <A href=""http://people.com/celebrity/leonardo-dicaprio-foundation-raises-45-million-at-third-annual-auction-gala/"">environmental activist</A> has produced and appears in a documentary on <mark>climate change</mark> titled <A href=""http://people.com/movies/leonardo-dicaprios-before-the-flood-documentary-trailer/""><EM>Before the Flood</EM></A>, which is directed by Fisher Stevens and had its world premiere Thursday at the <A href=""http://people.com/celebrity/leonardo-dicaprios-film-before-the-flood-shows-new-trailer-at-u-n/"">United Nations headquarters</A> in New York City.</P><P>“I mean, there were definitely some hairy moments,” the actor told PEOPLE at the premiere as he looked back on shooting the documentary, which did not come without its dangers. DiCaprio and Stevens traveled to remote, perilous places, where they witnessed icebergs collapse, communed with elephants, and, in one terrifying instance, were in a “[helicopter] flying over the fires of Sumatra” — a near-death experience that Stevens <A href=""http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/leonardo-dicaprio-before-the-flood"" target=""_blank"">chronicled recently to <EM>GQ</EM>.</A></P><P>Still, the actor said, “for the most part it was an eye-opening experience for all of us.”</P><P> </P><P>More alarming, the actor explained, is the lack of urgency with which some approach the <mark>climate</mark> crisis.</P><P>“People always talk about <mark>climate change</mark> in the distant future, this intangible thing that we can’t control,” the 41-year-old actor said. “But it’s happening right now, you know? It’s happening — to go to the Arctic and see that these ice shelves are disappearing, that Greenland is melting decades ahead of scientific predictions. That’s the terrifying stuff, truly.”</P><P>DiCaprio, who was named a <A href=""http://www.un.org/<mark>climate</mark>change/summit/2014/09/secretary-general-designates-leonardo-di-caprio-un-messenger-peace/"" target=""_blank"">U.N. Messenger of Peace</A> in 2014, said an ongoing fallout from the catastrophe remains inevitable.</P><P>“<mark>Climate</mark> refugees, freak hurricanes and storms that are going to continue — wildfires, droughts. That is terrifying, and I continue to be terrified about the future, really,” he said.</P><P> </P><P>That’s not to say the actor is resigned to a doomsday scenario. “You know, I’m slightly optimistic that we could do something about it because we’ve finally come together,” he explained, citing last year’s <A href=""http://time.com/4146764/paris-agreement-<mark>climate</mark>-cop-21/"" target=""_blank"">U.N. <mark>climate change</mark> conference COP 21</A> in Paris, where delegates reached the most significant agreement to date to address <mark>climate change</mark> by putting an end to fossil-fuel use and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P>“But,” DiCaprio added, “the world needs to take action. Otherwise, we’re in for some very bad news.”</P><P><EM>Before the Flood</EM> opens in theaters in New York and Los Angeles on Friday, and will be televised globally, in 171 countries and 45 languages, on the National Geographic Channel starting Oct. 30.</P><UL><LI><STRONG>Reporting by BLAKE BAKKILA</STRONG></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"
