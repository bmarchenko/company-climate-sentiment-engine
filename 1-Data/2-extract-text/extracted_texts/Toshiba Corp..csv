Instead, it cancelled the report, <A href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/toshiba-delays-earnings-snag-audit-process-source-044237861--sector.html"">saying</A> “it was not able to immediately secure the approval of its auditor.”</P><P><EM><A href=""https://www.ft.com/content/8ab47c78-f269-11e6-8758-6876151821a6"">Financial Times</A></EM> reports that “The delay to publication of Toshiba’s earnings came as the company said lawyers were examining claims by a whistleblower in the US that Westinghouse mishandled its takeover of Stone &amp; Webster.”</P><P>Toshiba’s losses stem from its construction of new nuclear plants in the United States.</P><P>The collapse of Toshiba will result in the halting of all new nuclear power plant construction by its US-based subsidiary, Westinghouse.</P><P>Toshiba’s failure also raises the question of what happens to the Vogtle plants if Toshiba fails? Does it open two southeastern U.S. utilities — Southern and SCANA — up to exposure to Toshiba shareholder lawsuits? And who will build future U.S. nuclear plants?</P><P><STRONG>How Bad Is It?</STRONG></P><P>The loss estimate is already $2.6 billion higher than the estimate Toshiba gave in December, and could go higher.</P><P>The reason it could go higher is that nobody knows how long it will take to finish the U.S. plants, which are three years behind schedule and billions over budget.</P><P>Toshiba as recently as last June had as its goal the construction of 45 nuclear reactors around the world, including two in the UK, six in India, and possibly two more in Georgia, all using Westinghouse’s design, the AP-1000. Future Westinghouse reactors will either be built by some other company or not at all.</P><P>Toshiba’s last auditor, <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-toshiba-accounting-ernst-idUSKBN0U505S20151222"">Ernst and Young, was fined $17.5 million</A> in 2015 after failing to blow the whistle on an accounting scandal. In January, <A href=""https://www.ft.com/content/7cfd3c68-d23a-11e6-b06b-680c49b4b4c0"">Japanese prosecutors charged</A> that Toshiba executives exaggerated profits by $339 million over three years.</P><P>The announcement comes less than two years after the $5.3 billion bail-out by the French government of Areva, its state-owned nuclear company, currently undergoing a massive reorganization.</P><P>Nuclear energy is, simply, in a rapidly accelerating crisis:</P><UL><LI><STRONG>Demand for nuclear energy globally is low</STRONG>, and the new reactors being built may not keep up with the closure of nuclear plants around the world. Half of all U.S. nuclear plants are at risk of closure over the next 13 years.</LI><LI><STRONG>Japan has only opened two of its 42 shuttered nuclear reactors</STRONG>, six years after Fukushima. Most experts estimated it would have two-thirds open by now. The reason is simple: low public acceptance.</LI><LI><STRONG>While some still see India as a sure-thing for nuclear</STRONG>, the nation has not resolved key obstacles to building new plants, and is likely to add just 16 GW of nuclear by 2030, not the 63 GW that was anticipated.</LI><LI><STRONG>Vietnam had worked patiently for 20 years to build public support</STRONG> for a major nuclear build-out before abruptly scrapping those plans in response to rising public fears and costs last year. Vietnam now intends to build coal plants.</LI><LI><STRONG>Last month Entergy, a major nuclear operator, announced it was getting out of the nuclear generation business</STRONG> in states where electricity has been de-regulated, including New York where it operates the highly lucrative Indian Point.</LI></UL><P>With the French nuclear industry crippled and Toshiba-Westinghouse out of the nuclear construction business, the West is effectively ceding the future of nuclear energy to China, Korea and Russia.</P><P><STRONG>What Happened to Standardization?</STRONG></P><P>The AP-1000 is a “Generation III+” design like the European Pressurized Reactor (EPR). The EPR, like the AP-1000, has experienced construction delays — only far more extreme. Construction began on its FOAK Finland in 2005 and was supposed to have finished in 2009. It now says it will open in 2019.</P><P>The conventional wisdom among nuclear experts had been that the AP-1000 was superior to the over-built EPR with its ostentatious double containment dome. The AP-1000 would be built faster and more cheaply than the EPR, many thought.</P><P>While the EPR’s delays will likely be longer, and while Toshiba and Areva will restructure their nuclear businesses differently, it is notable that both companies bet — and lost — big on radically new designs.</P><P>Why did Westinghouse push forward with a new and untested design — the AP-1000 — in the first place, instead of building more of the same reactors it had in the past?</P><P>Already by the early 1970s, U.S. nuclear plant operators were seeking to standardize nuclear plant design to reduce the time and cost of licensing and construction.</P><P>In the 1980s, a utility coalition came up with a Utility Requirements Document to identify the things utilities wanted in a reactor to come up with a standard design, rather than plants unique to each site. AP-1000 was the outcome of that process of seeking standardization.</P><P>With the AP-1000, the idea was that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) would license the plant and reactor design just once, giving its owners the security of moving forward with construction plans without fear that their design would be rejected by NRC.</P><P>Standardization was expected to also be important in mass-manufacturing modules that could then be assembled on site.</P><P>It didn’t turn out that way. There were significant delays in both construction of the basic foundation, and in manufacturing the modules.</P><P>In the U.S. and China, AP-1000 plants are three years behind schedule.</P><P>Toshiba’s losses stem from Westinghouse’s purchase of CB&amp;I’s Stone and Webster, one of the main construction companies building the AP-1000 in Georgia and South Carolina.</P><P>Stone and Webster had been bought earlier by Shaw Group.</P><P>None of them had had any experience building nuclear plants.</P><P>Westinghouse made the purchase to settle the lawsuit against it by CB&amp;I and by Southern and Scana, and because it thought it could do a better job than Stone and Webster.</P><P>All parties had sued Westinghouse saying they had been misled into believing the design was done. “Westinghouse’s response was effectively don’t blame us and you should have known better,” a person close to the situation told me.</P><P>China made similar complaints years earlier. “People felt we paid full price for a half-completed design,” a Chinese nuclear engineer told me in 2015. The result was three years of delay, higher costs, and deteriorating relationship between China and Westinghouse.</P><P><STRONG>How Construction Failed</STRONG></P><P>Construction began in China and in the US before all of the performance testing had been completed. There was less “learning-by-doing,” the American source told me, than there should have been since the Chinese and American projects were overlapping instead of sequential.</P><P>As part of its settlement, Toshiba reaffirmed its fixed price guarantee, even though it did not have a good handle on how much was left to do.</P><P>The American side was inexperienced. “Although an experienced nuclear engineer, [Westinghouse’s] Mr. Benjamin had never actually overseen construction of a new nuclear-power plant,” <A href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/troubled-chinese-nuclear-project-illustrates-toshibas-challenges-1483051382"">noted Brian Spegele of Wall Street Journal in December</A>.</P><P>The things that caused delays were often mundane: simply laying concrete and re-bar in accordance with the drawings. “The plant’s containment and cooling towers are done,” a different source told me. “It’s all the re-bar and concrete work that’s taking time.”</P><P>Vogtle’s builders struggled to create the special materials required for the plant as well as with documentation to meet NRC’s stringent standards.</P><P>That didn’t always work. I was told that a dispute between an on-site NRC inspector and project manager over whether a 1973 or 1990 standard should be used delayed construction for six months. The area in question was just 20 cubic yards in a 2,000 cubic yard foundation.</P><P>The Georgia PSC and Georgia Power have tried to streamline regulations to reduce conflicts over change orders, but it’s not clear how much of it has worked.</P><P>One of the problems was that NRC imposed new regulations on the AP-1000 after it had already approved the Westinghouse design in 2006. The first was the Aircraft rule and the second were rules created after Fukushima.</P><P>“The design revisions required to meet the Aircraft Rule changes involved at least three more design revisions that did not get final approval until Jan 2012,” <A href=""#6d777ad97b0a"">noted Rod Adams</A>. “Completely different construction techniques needed to be invented, tested, litigated and approved.”</P><P>However, I was also told that Westinghouse sought an alternative construction technique for the shield building, and that the company could have stayed with its standard construction and not experienced delays.</P><P><STRONG>How Lack of Demand and Over-Regulation Slowed Construction</STRONG></P><P>Deliberate foot-dragging to raise costs by US plant builders and module manufacturers appears to have been a significant factor in addition to poor management and inexperience.</P><P>Once it became clear to suppliers and contractors there would not be any more AP-1000 nuclear power plant builds in the US thanks to low natural gas prices and the absence of subsidies that make building wind and solar attractive, suppliers had no incentive to perform their work quickly.</P><P>“If he could get cement change orders,” one person told me, “all the better for adding cost. And there’s no downside to being embarrassed because of slow or poor work since there’s no future market.”</P><P>NRC in 2013 took action against CB&amp;I to fix its workplace culture, and NRC inspectors are at CB&amp;I’s Louisiana site.</P><P>Disincentives for operating efficiently combined with lack of experience and over-regulation to result in delays. When managers would complain about the slow pace and seek to speed things up, some workers would say that any effort to make the process faster would compromise on safety. That would often be enough to make managers under the watchful eyes of NRC inspectors err on the side of slowness.</P><P>“The cost overrun situation is driven by a near-perfect storm of societal risk-aversion to nuclear causing ultra-restrictive regulatory requirements, construction complexity, and lack of nuclear construction experience by the industry,” Lake Barrett, a former official at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, <A href=""#.WJ07IhIrJZ0"">told Japan Times</A>.</P><P>The NRC had turned down requests by anti-nuclear groups to impose Aircraft rule in 1982, 1985 and again in 1994. After 9/11, the NRC caved in to demands, even as it declared point blank that the Aircraft Rule would not improve safety, and that it would only apply the rule to new plants — including non-light water reactors.</P><P>Nuclear power’s worst accidents cause less harm than the normal operation of fossil power plants and yet the latter, unburdened by debates over how to pour 20 cubic feet of cement, can be constructed far more quickly.</P><P>There is unlikely to be higher demand and lower costs for nuclear without higher social acceptance, and there is unlikely to be higher social acceptance without overcoming the fears.</P><P>Nations are unlikely to buy nuclear from nations like the US, France and Japan that are closing (or not opening) their nuclear power plants.</P><P>“They hear the Japanese telling potential customers, ‘Nuclear is safe enough for you, but not for me,’” a source close to Toshiba told me. “That’s not going to work.”</P><P><STRONG>Why Korea Won</STRONG></P><P>Korea is winning the global competition to build new nuclear plants against China and Russia despite being a fraction of the size, at just 50 million people, and energy-poor.</P><P>It has done so through focus: standard design, standard construction of plants, standard operation and standard regulation. Korea’s nuclear plants are plug-and-play.</P><P> Studies show that standardized designs, multiple reactors on one site, and a vertically integrated builder were the keys to declines in the cost of building nuclear power plants in France and Korea.</P><P>It’s easy to understand why. New designs interrupt the process of learning-by-doing and continuous improvement that allow things to move more quickly.</P><P>Standardization is especially important to nuclear because so many people and institutions — the designer, the builder and many subcontractors, and the regulator — are needed to work in synchrony to do anything. Any single actor can slow the process down.</P><P>Realizing the benefits of standardization requires repetition. Because it takes so long to build a nuclear plant — between two and ten years on average — a senior construction manager will only have a limited amount of experience building before retiring.</P><P>Korean nuclear construction managers are promoted as they go from project to project, their careers as well-planned as the projects themselves.</P><P>What’s true for construction is also true for operation. After Three Mile Island meltdown in 1979, nuclear operators organized to improve safety and performance.</P><P>Increasing nuclear power plant efficiency from 1980 to today came from two areas: first, improvements to how operators re-fuel reactors, and keep plants and their workers safe; second, increasing the heat and electrical generation of plants through “up-rates.”</P><P>Both required greatly improved training systems and industry cooperation. So-called “soft” factors like safety culture, regular training, and the constant re-writing of procedure manuals proved crucial.</P><P>Since then, U.S. nuclear plants have gone from producing power about half the time to producing power 92 percent of the time.</P><P>AP-1000 was a radical <mark>innovation</mark>. Based on a plant that had never existed — the AP-600 — the plant was, like Areva’s European Pressurized Reactor (EPR), a radical break from the past.</P><P>Everybody who has an innovative design to sell promises that their design will triumph over all others, and become the industry standard. A few years later, someone else has a better design to sell.</P><P>Radical breaks from past designs sometimes work in industries that require little up-front capital, like Internet companies.</P><P>It’s now clear that they are deadly when it comes to nuclear.</P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

When the scorching westerly wind known as the loo swept in and hit the sheets, the evaporating water absorbed the brunt of the heat. White chalk spread on the roof reflected the sun and dropped the temperature further. They were old methods of coping with the heat, like drinking lassis or chaas when “struck by the loo,” and they were effective. </P><P id=""RzUYUz"">But the weather, already hot, has been getting hotter. In the summer of 2015, it hit 114 degrees Fahrenheit in nearby Ahmedabad, where Vora works as a correspondent for <EM>The Hindu</EM>. The next summer, it passed 122 degrees, a record. It’s not uncommon for people to wrap their faces in wet cloth when venturing onto the furnace-like streets, and the wind is so hot it feels heavy. “For about a decade, the temperature has been going up,” Vora said. “But now, the last couple summers have been extreme, going beyond normal, bearable conditions.” </P><P id=""3iKzZV"">Earlier this year, Vora’s mother came down with a bacterial infection, and part of the doctor’s prescription was to stay cool. When the meteorological department warned of yet another punishing summer on the way, Vora decided it was time to buy an air conditioner. </P><DIV class=""c-float-right c-float-hang""><ASIDE id=""VIFrsM""><Q>“The last couple summers have been extreme, going beyond normal, bearable conditions.” </Q></ASIDE></DIV><P id=""r9F6x2"">Across India, millions of people are making similar calculations.The share of Indians with air conditioning is still small, roughly 5 percent, but it’s growing fast.Rising incomes are making air conditioners more attainable, while rising temperatures are making them a necessity. “There are hundreds of millions of people for whom air conditioning doesn't seem like a luxury good,” said <A href=""https://economics.uchicago.edu/directory/michael-greenstone"">Michael Greenstone</A>, director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. “It can mean the difference between life and death.” </P><P id=""lfGZiD"">The cooling industry has found a ready market in Ahmedabad, the largest city in the state of Gujarat. The city bakes each summer until the monsoon comes, at which point temperatures drop into the 90s and the humidity rises to stifling levels. Above the city’s winding streets, crowded with fleets of auto rickshaws and mopeds, billboards declare that every home deserves Hitachi cooling. Elsewhere<STRONG>,</STRONG> Panasonic ads extol the speed at which its “life conditioners” can cool a room. Apartment ads list AC first among amenities offered, and restaurants promise relief from the heat. Appliance shops along the roadside display the industry’s major players in big letters on their windows: Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Blue Star, Panasonic, General — the King of Cool, etched in glass with a crown — Daikin, Carrier. </P><P id=""to9gau"">The <A href=""https://eta.lbl.gov/publications/benefits-leapfrogging-superefficiency"">world is on track</A> to add 700 million new ACs by 2030, and 1.6 billion by 2050, largely in hot, developing countries like India and Indonesia. But the AC boom threatens to worsen the crisis it’s responding to, and widen the divide between those who can afford to stay cool and those left out in the heat. </P><P id=""ZGqPQa"">Air conditioners use refrigerants, and some of the most common types — hydrofluoro<mark>carbon</mark>s, or HFCs —  are powerful greenhouse gases, with thousands of times the warming potential of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide. If HFC use continues to grow at its current pace, these chemicals could make up as much as <A href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/106/27/10949.full.pdf"">19 percent</A> of emissions by 2050. International initiatives are set to phase down the worst offenders, but air conditioners contribute to <mark>climate change</mark> in a second way: they consume a tremendous amount of electricity. Handling the growing load will require adding thousands of new power plants to the grid.</P><DIV class=""c-float-left c-float-hang""><ASIDE id=""AVASLN""><Q>The AC boom threatens to worsen the crisis it’s responding to</Q></ASIDE></DIV><P id=""FOpIGG"">Air conditioners may be a double-edged tool, but some way of adapting to the rising heat will have to be found. High temperatures are already interfering with people’s ability to work, making people sick<STRONG>,</STRONG> and outright killing thousands. If heating is considered a basic requirement in Western countries, said Satish Kumar, executive chairman of the New Delhi-based <A href=""http://www.aeee.in/"">Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy</A>, it’s time to start thinking about cooling the same way. “We are saying that a basic level of thermal comfort in order to be productive, in order to sit comfortably in your home during the night, it should not be a question. Everybody should have access to that level of comfort.” </P><P id=""BIr52w"">Vora recalls the first time his family turned on their AC. His father announced that “from now onwards, the summer has gone from our life.” His mother asked the mechanic what temperature to keep it at to minimize electricity bills. “We survived so many decades, my father, and the people of his age, they would have hardly used AC,” Vora said. “But mine, and I imagine the next generation, they can’t live without it.” </P><DIV class=""p-fullbleed-block""><FIGURE class=""e-image""><SPAN class=""e-image__meta""><FIGCAPTION><EM>A drink vendor on a hot day in New Delhi.</EM></FIGCAPTION></SPAN></FIGURE></DIV><P class=""p-dropcap has-dropcap"" id=""2th0KW"">One of the dangerous things about heat is the way it can sneak up on you. We deal with hot days all the time, and generally, they’re uncomfortable at worst. We wear light clothes, stand in the shade, fan ourselves, and commiserate. Our bodies work to stay at around 98.6 degrees: blood vessels dilate to move heat to the skin where it can be radiated into the air. If that’s not enough, we produce sweat, and heat gets absorbed turning it to vapor. But the effects of heat are nonlinear, and the line between discomfort and danger can be hard to detect. When the air becomes hotter than the body, skin stops radiating heat and starts to absorb it. If humidity is high, sweat can’t evaporate into the already saturated air. If you exert yourself, your core temperature will start to climb, and your body will struggle to bring it down. </P><P id=""VE9IuB"">Discomfort turns into fatigue, nausea, disorientation — symptoms of a fever, which is what it is. Skin turns bright red and sweat pours out as the body’s cooling systems go into overdrive. The heart starts to pound as it struggles to pump thickening blood, muscles spasm, sweat runs dry. At that point, the body is uncontrollably overheating.

Air conditioners run refrigerant through coils in a loop. The refrigerant absorbs heat from inside a room as it turns from liquid to gas, then deposits heat outside as it’s condensed into liquid again. Because cooler air holds less moisture, water vapor condenses on the conditioner’s coils, lowering the humidity. (That condensate is the liquid that drops on city-dwellers’ heads in the summer.) </P><P id=""5oTC0O"">Though primarily thought of as a comfort appliance, ACs also save lives.

Five years ago, it was just him and a couple employees. Now he has a staff of 14 and runs them like a fire department, dispatching teams of two as calls come in. In the summer, they work from 7:30 in the morning to 3AM, each duo taking as many as 20 calls a day. They move through the city on mopeds, so as to better weave through Ahmedabad’s snarled traffic.

It has a five-star rating system meant to encourage people to purchase more efficient ACs, and the shops in Ahmedabad display the stars with large stickers on each device. Several companies have released lines of 5.8-star ACs. Godrej, a New Delhi-based company, uses <mark>climate</mark>-friendly, though flammable, propane as a refrigerant; it boasts it’s broken the scale with a six-star AC. In order to drive down the price for consumers, earlier this summer, <A href=""http://www.igsd.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Updated-EESL-AC-Bulk-Procurement-4-Aug.pdf"">the Indian government arranged the bulk purchase</A> of 100,000 superefficient ACs from Panasonic and Godrej, and is planning to order half a million more.</P><P id=""XD4Cvv"">Even with increasing efficiency and better refrigerants, however, the energy demand will still be immense. The ACs India alone is expected to install by 2030 will be the equivalent of adding several new midsize countries to the global grid. With air conditioners already accounting for up to 60 percent of the summertime electricity use in cities like New Delhi, simply meeting the demand — and meeting it without burning huge amounts of fossil fuels — will be a challenge. “This AC load should be kind of taken with the same level of seriousness as renewable energy policies are taken,” said Nikit Abhyankar, a researcher at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, pointing out that even <A href=""https://eta.lbl.gov/publications/accelerating-energy-efficiency"">incremental improvements</A> in efficiency will greatly reduce energy use.</P><P id=""P9w0NS"">In Ahmedabad, health officials worry that all the new ACs are pumping heat out into the streets, raising the temperature for anyone who can’t afford an AC of their own.

Age-old cooling tricks like courtyards, crossbreeze-promoting corners, eaves, porches, and other architectural features were dispensed with.

When figuring out what sort of HVAC equipment to put in a building, engineers use models that attempt to predict what temperature and humidity levels occupants will be happy with. It’s a necessarily difficult attempt to quantify something subjective. One of the widest-used thermal comfort standards, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 55, acknowledges thermal comfort is “a condition of mind” before setting out on a valiant effort to model everything from the metabolic rate of someone typing to the insulation factor of calf-length socks.</P><P id=""01kPFG"">ASHRAE dictates a comfortable temperature in the range of 67 to 82 degrees, depending on the season and other variables, yet it’s become a widely acknowledged problem that air-conditioned buildings are too cold. Figuring out exactly why — whether the standard is resulting in overpowered AC systems, building managers are overcooling so men can wear suits in summer, or some other reason — is “the holy grail,” in the words of one researcher, and the subject of ongoing research. </P><P id=""lR9Vlp"">There are big gains to be had in raising building temperatures. In 2005, Japan launched an energy-saving initiative called <A href=""http://www.eesi.org/articles/view/the-japanese-cool-biz-campaign-increasing-comfort-in-the-workplace"">Cool Biz</A>, setting office thermostats at 82 and encouraging workers to forgo ties and heavy business suits.

Most of the international comfort standards were developed by institutions in the global north, based largely on surveys of people unaccustomed to India’s heat. “The premise was that occupants in buildings in India are very different from occupants in Europe or the US, which is where the international standards come from,” said Sanyogita Manu, who led the study. “We didn’t have a thermal comfort model of our own.” </P><DIV class=""c-float-right c-float-hang""><ASIDE id=""7CcV8h""><Q>“We didn’t have a thermal comfort model of our own.” </Q></ASIDE></DIV><P id=""upBiYP"">Manu traveled to office buildings from humid Chennai in southern India to mountainous Shimla in the Himalayan foothills, wielding monitors to test the temperature, humidity, and airspeed, and asking workers whether they were comfortable. </P><P id=""1k0Mqw"">She <A href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132315302171"">found that</A> Indians are indeed comfortable at slightly higher temperatures than existing models would predict, particularly when in buildings that aren’t sealed up and air conditioned. Previous research has shown that in buildings without AC, people are comfortable at higher indoor temperatures the hotter it is outside; they don’t expect refrigerated coolness, they wear lighter clothes, they open windows, they use fans, and their bodies adjust to the heat. The mere feeling of control over things like windows and fans also makes people feel more comfortable, even if the temperature remains the same. The models that reflect this are called “adaptive,” but they’re typically only used for buildings that aren’t air conditioned at all. The CEPT team found that the same phenomenon also applied to mixed-mode buildings — buildings that switch on the AC when it gets hot — and that people were comfortable in environments up to almost 88 degrees. <A href=""http://www.carbse.org/event/carbse-cept-thermal-comfort-research-included-in-national-building-code-2016/"">Last year</A>, the Indian government adopted their model in the national building code.

Clamped to each researcher’s desk was a monitor, testing the temperature, humidity, and airspeed. Nestled in the trees of the campus, positioned to minimize direct sun exposure, and equipped with a suite of various cooling technologies, the building is able to coast without air conditioning until the heat gets extreme. With solar panels on the roof, the building produces more energy than it uses over the course of the year. The air inside felt slightly damp, but cool. </P><P id=""hc7IAM"">Rawal and his team say buildings like this are the way forward for India, but they’re well aware of the challenges to widespread adoption. Buildings like CEPT’s require bespoke design, whereas air-conditioned buildings can be mass-produced and are cheap to make, if not to keep cool. “You get a bad building, you still buy it because a split AC can make it habitable,” Rawal said. “Hence people are making it because they know you’ll find a way to make it habitable.” </P><P id=""K9LNvI"">Rawal is particularly intrigued by one technology in particular: the evaporative cooler. It uses far less electricity than an air conditioner, and doesn’t use refrigerants. Instead, a fan blows on a wetted pad, cooling hot air through evaporation. Also known as an air cooler or swamp cooler, it’s an electric version of the drenched sheets Vora’s parents used. One such machine sits in the lab’s thermal comfort chamber, amid fans and thermometers and a sensor-filled manikin dressed in a beige kurti, sitting at a desk. </P><DIV class=""p-fullbleed-block""><FIGURE class=""e-image""><SPAN class=""e-image__meta""><FIGCAPTION><EM>Control panel for CEPT’s cooling systems.</EM></FIGCAPTION></SPAN></FIGURE></DIV><P class=""p-dropcap has-dropcap"" id=""bLtKph"">The world’s largest cooler manufacturer, Symphony, is based in Ahmedabad, in a conspicuously modern concrete building sitting amid trees and empty lots off the highway. Founded in 1988, the company is now worth over a billion dollars and has made its founder and chairman, Achal Bakeri, one of the country’s <A href=""http://www.forbesindia.com/printcontent/41353"">richest people</A>. </P><P id=""rVUQ9o"">Bakeri, the scion of a prominent real estate family, offers a classic startup origin story for the company’s founding. Home after completing an MBA at the University of Southern California, he was sitting in his parents’ living room when he was struck by the ugliness of their air cooler. “It worked really well, but the product was aesthetically very bad and made a lot of noise,” he said. He took it apart and started learning how it worked. Seeing an opportunity, he put a small team together to design a better version. They set up shop in the parking garage of one of his family’s construction sites and built the first Symphony air cooler. Their first run sold out within a week. </P><P id=""cuGJpv"">Today, the company is focused on air coolers and air coolers only, and it’s expanding into markets abroad — markets that <mark>climate change</mark> is helping open. In 2010, Russia was hit by an <A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>central.org/blogs/2010-russian-heatwave-more-extreme-than-previously-thought"">unprecedented and deadly</A> heat wave, with temperatures in Moscow passing 100 degrees.

Four or five years back, temperatures in the UK touched about 27 [80.6 Fahrenheit]  and everybody jumped into the lake,” he said, laughing.

Coolers are cheap and use little power, making them affordable to many for whom ACs are out of reach. They’re also relatively easy to set up — you just need to fill them with water and plug them in. In a generally temperate place like Germany, it wouldn't be worth the hassle and expense of installing an AC, Mishra said, but a cooler would be easy to roll out of the closet in the event of a freak heat wave. </P><P id=""DbqTrZ"">The major drawback of coolers is that they don’t work when it’s humid, for the same reason sweating loses its effectiveness. If the air is nearly saturated with moisture already, water won’t evaporate off the pad, the air won’t cool, and the device will function more like fan that makes the room even muggier. But in hot and dry regions, they work very well. In addition to India, Symphony’s core markets are arid countries in the Middle East and Africa. In 2009, they scooped up IMPCO, a Phoenix-based company that has been producing coolers since the 1930s.

Symphony’s biggest project so far — the biggest air cooler project <EM>anywhere</EM> so far — is Mecca. In 2006, Symphony installed 200 giant coolers on the Jamarat Bridge, which millions of pilgrims cross each year, and 50,000 units in the residential section, where cooler intakes jut up from each tent like chimneys. </P><P id=""DiS4Yr"">Cavernous factories, warehouses, outdoor restaurants, and amusement parks will be growing markets for coolers, Mishra said, especially as temperatures rise. In 2015, Symphony bought the Chinese cooler company Keruilai, and is now cooling automobile factories and train maintenance yards there. “As the temperature goes up, working conditions will become harsher in factories,” Mishra said. “The demand for air coolers will be enormous.” </P><P id=""sa2IlJ"">Mishra recognizes <mark>climate change</mark> as a threat, and a business opportunity. “It looks bright!” he said, laughing, when I asked him about the future of the cooling industry. “Because of the changing <mark>climate</mark>, unfortunately.

Probably, I would go for humans.”</Q></ASIDE></DIV><P id=""F8udE5"">Adapting will be expensive. With every degree of warming that gets locked into the <mark>climate</mark> system, the more it will cost to maintain something resembling normal life, and the more people there will be who are unable to afford it. The particular problem posed by heat isn’t that it’s impossible to adapt to, it’s that it’s difficult to adapt to equitably and in a way that doesn’t make the problem worse. Like mitigating <mark>climate change</mark> overall, any cooling solution will require collective action, in the form of international agreements like the Kigali Amendment, efficiency regulations, subsidies, technological advances, new building designs, and civic programs. </P><P id=""m4fqFM"">This year, Ahmedabad added an element to its heat action plan designed not just to cope with extreme heat, but reduce it. A quarter of the city’s population lives in the slums ringing the city, jammed together in small concrete boxes with tin roofs that turn them into solar ovens. The city has begun <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/experts/nehmat-kaur/ahmedabad-cool-roofs-initiative-5th-heat-action-plan"">painting these roofs white</A>, and covering public buildings with reflective white mosaic tiles. It’s a modest adaptation, but it can drop the indoor temperature by several degrees. “The fact is that the gap between the rich people and the poor people is increasing,” Shah said. “It is going to be very difficult. They are going to be more vulnerable, they are going to face more problems.”</P><P id=""YIAB9E"">Shah has his own list of immediate adaptations the city needs to make. More trees need to be planted, he said, to lower the city’s temperature. There need to be more cooling centers installed, and mass transit should be expanded so all the internal combustion engines stop heating the streets. There will need to be new regulations around working hours for jobs like construction, so laborers don’t die of heatstroke. The city is looking for ways to build awnings that can shade whole intersections, so vendors and traffic police can get shelter from the sun. Piece by mundane piece, through new appliances and public works, the city will have to reconfigure itself to survive in the changing <mark>climate</mark>. </P><P class=""c-end-para"" id=""XmPgTV"">“It’s going to be hotter,” Shah said. “It’s not getting cooler anymore.” </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Many were unintentional, while others revealed just how badly some companies need to take an ethics refresher course. Here's a list (in no particular order) of the biggest errors, scandals, and crimes of the world of big business in 2015.</P><H2>1. Toshiba's accounting scandal.</H2><P>In an effort to meet aggressive profit targets set by executives and managers, Toshiba decided to<A target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/toshiba-slashes-earnings-for-past-7-years-1441589473""> fudge its financial results</A>.

In two waves of arrests in May and December, U.S. investigators brought RICO charges against the organization, <A target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/26/sports/soccer/the-fifa-scandal-whats-happened-and-whats-to-come.html"">accusing FIFA officials</A> of taking millions of dollars in bribes to influence clothing sponsorship contracts, the FIFA presidential election, and the selection process for the World Cup. </P><H2>3.

The employee had worked for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York prior to Goldman and used his connections to get the confidential information. </P><H2>4. The dirty business of oil and gas.</H2><P>In November, 44 people and nine different oil and gas companies in New York City were <A target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/nyregion/11-indictments-detail-widespread-fraud-in-heating-oil-industry-of-new-york-city.html?&amp;moduleDetail=section-news-4&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=N.Y.%20%2F%20Region&amp;region=Footer&amp;module=MoreInSection&amp;version=WhatsNext&amp;contentID=WhatsNext&amp;pgtype=article&amp;_r=0"">indicted on charges of corruption and fraud</A>. The Manhattan district attorney's indictments allege that the companies stole and resold about $34 million worth of heating oil that was never delivered to its customers.

The company, which is based in Hong Kong, had been keeping names, home addresses, photos, videos, and chat logs on vulnerable servers. Fortunately for all involved, instead of selling the data or holding it for ransom, the hacker just went to the press so VTech <A target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/01/business/security-breach-at-toy-maker-vtech-includes-data-on-children.html"">would fix the security issues</A>. </P><H2>6. Exxon Mobil deliberately misleads the public about <mark>climate change</mark>.</H2><P>From the 1980s through the early '90s, Exxon had teams of scientists studying global warming in the Arctic. The scientists concluded that global warming is real, and that it posed potential dangers for the company--higher sea levels could damage Exxon's drilling platforms, processing plants, pump stations, and pipelines. But company documents reveal that, instead of helping to combat the environmental risk, Exxon (now Exxon Mobile) decided to launch a multimillion-dollar campaign questioning <mark>climate change</mark> in order to bolster company profits.</P><H2>7. Volkswagen cheats emissions tests.</H2><P>In September, the Environmental Protection Agency caught Volkswagen <A target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/business-34324772"">in a huge scandal</A> that reportedly could <A target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/02/news/companies/volkswagen-scandal-bp-credit-suisse/"">cost the company as much as $87 billion</A>. The EPA uncovered that diesel-engine VW models sold in the United States had software installed allowing the cars to falsely pass emissions tests. Since then, VW has admitted to cheating the tests deliberately and revealed that 11 million cars worldwide were fitted with the so-called &quot;defeat device.&quot;</P><H2>8. Turing Pharmaceuticals jacks up prices.</H2><P>Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli bought the rights to a drug named Daraprim, which treats a rare infection in HIV/AIDS patients--and promptly increased the price of it by 5,000 percent, from $18 a pill to $750. The former hedge fund manager said he was pressured by the company's board to make the company profitable. Still, the price hike and Shkreli's boorish behavior following it--including a statement that he should have raised the cost even higher--was a PR nightmare for the company and gave him the title of &quot;<A href=""https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/i-am-the-worlds-most-hated-ceo-ask-me-anything.html"">most hated CEO in the world</A>.&quot;</P></DIV><DIV class=""ArticlePubdate__pubdate__3kWwF"">Published on: Dec 23, 2015</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""col-md-8 offset-md-0 col-lg-8 offset-lg-1""><DIV><DIV class=""ArticleFooterLayout__moduleTitle__2uEHY"">More from Inc.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The company employs 3,800 workers in Western Pennsylvania. </P><P class=""News-body-text""> The project “recognizes the need and desire for clean energy and what Westinghouse can contribute for clean energy in India,” Boone said, noting that it is “the largest deal of its kind” for the company.  </P><P class=""News-body-text""> Boone declined to provide a value but a single AP1000 reactor can cost about $5 billion, according to industry estimates.  </P><P class=""News-body-text""> The U.S. and India announced the deal Tuesday between Westinghouse, a unit of <mark>Toshiba Corp.</mark>, and Nuclear Power Corp. of India Ltd., a government-owned nuclear development company. Though the two countries said engineering and site development work was starting, there was no agreement about the major unresolved issues: cost and financing. Instead, the countries said only that they had agreed to finalize a contract by June 2017. </P><P class=""News-body-text""> “Once completed, this project will fill the promise of the U.S.-India civil nuclear agreement and will create and sustain 10,000 jobs here in the U.S. and in India,” John Morton, White House senior director for energy and <mark>climate change</mark>, said during a conference call Tuesday. </P><P class=""News-body-text""> Westinghouse has eight AP1000 reactors under construction — two in South Carolina, two in Georgia and four in China. But the company has had to lay off workers in recent years as expected nuclear deals failed to materialize. Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011, competition from cheaper natural gas plants and slowing global growth sapped demand for nuclear plants.      </P><P class=""News-body-text""> Toshiba has slashed thousands of jobs and sold parts of its business. The Japanese conglomerate wrote down $2.3 billion of Westinghouse's value in April. Toshiba bought Westinghouse in 2006 for $5.4 billion, but the business has deteriorated since the disaster in Japan.  </P><P class=""News-body-text""> The contract in India is a potentially huge boost to Westinghouse, but without knowing the project's cost or how it will be paid for, it is difficult to judge the true impact on the company, said Chris Gadomski, lead nuclear analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance in New York. </P><P class=""News-body-text""> “To be frank, I'll believe it when the check clears,” Gadomski said. “There's so many of these deals that, you have to wait until the pie is completely cooked.” </P><P class=""News-body-text""> Other nuclear projects in China, Turkey and Russia were proposed years ago but have yet to break ground, he said. </P><P class=""News-body-text""> Once the financing is figured out, Westinghouse must determine where the sub-components of the plant will be built. </P><P class=""News-body-text""> Most likely, the majority of the work will be done by subcontractors in India, Gadomski said. Having the parts made close to construction sites would be cheaper and could help Westinghouse establish a cost-effective supply chain for other projects in Asian markets where it hopes to win business. </P><P class=""News-body-text""> “If they have a supply source in India, that helps them be more competitive in those markets,” Gadomski said. </P><P class=""News-body-text""> The project will help India limit <mark>carbon</mark> emissions as it works toward quadrupling its annual electricity production by 2030. The endorsement from the White House indicated that President Obama's administration sees nuclear power as important to curbing <mark>climate change</mark>.  </P><P class=""News-body-text""> In the joint agreement, the United States and India reaffirmed their commitments to the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement, which seeks to limit emissions that are said to contribute to <mark>climate change</mark>. India is the world's third-largest <mark>carbon</mark> emitter among nations, after China and the United States.  </P><P class=""News-body-text""> India will try to join the <mark>climate change</mark> deal within the year, the Obama administration said. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Obama at the White House and the two leaders played up their efforts to cooperate on issues of global concern.  </P><P class=""News-body-text""> Stressing their “strong bonds,” Obama said the world's two largest democracies had “joined forces” to bring about the landmark <mark>climate</mark> agreement that was reached in December in Paris.  </P><P class=""News-body-text"">  “We discussed how we can, as quickly as possible, bring the Paris agreement into place; how we can make sure that <mark>climate</mark> financing that's necessary for India to be able to embark on its bold vision for solar energy and clean energy that Prime Minister Modi has laid out can be accomplished,” Obama said alongside Modi after their meeting in the Oval Office.   </P><P class=""credits"">  Bloomberg News and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Hence, the ISO 26000 fails to account for the triple bottom line mainstream </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x0 hc y97 ff6 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">and so allows the company to tailor its report to the standards by selecting issues only concerned </DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x0 hc y98 ff8 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">with its stakeholders’ benefit regardless of the opinion of the international community (<SPAN class=""ff6"">Moratis, </SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""t m0 x0 hc y99 ff6 fs3 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"">2016).

  Matthew McKinzie</A></SPAN></SPAN></DIV></HEADER><DIV class=""page-node-wrap post-content""><DIV class=""l-content-full-wrap""><SPAN class=""body-content""><P>Just weeks before the start of the Trump administration, there is much uncertainty about which nuclear energy policies will be pursued, and what the policy timelines could be. But as a new year opens, it’s worth taking stock of how much happened in 2016. It was a year marked by major developments for nuclear power across the United States: from California to Nebraska to Illinois to Tennessee to New York.</P><P>Those developments were not largely in nuclear safety, or radioactive waste, or plant security, but instead the economics of nuclear power. They spoke to fundamental questions of energy policy: what role can nuclear energy play in a future of <mark>climate change</mark>? And, to what extent will U.S. nuclear plants be subsidized? </P><H3>The Costs of Nuclear Energy</H3><P>Some of the most significant developments in nuclear power in 2016 occurred at the level of state governments and public utility commissions, and not at the federal level.</P><P>June brought the <A href=""https://www.pge.com/en_US/safety/how-the-system-works/diablo-canyon-power-plant/joint-proposal.page?WT.mc_id=Vanity_jointproposal""><STRONG>Diablo Canyon</STRONG> Joint Proposal</A>: a commitment by the nuclear utility, labor and environmental organizations, including NRDC, to the orderly phase-out of California’s last nuclear power plant by 2025 and the replacement of its electric generating capacity by efficiency gains, wind power and solar power.</P><P>In August, the New York Public Service Commission adopted the <STRONG><A href=""http://www3.dps.ny.gov/W/PSCWeb.nsf/All/56C58A580D2CF2E185257FD4006B90CE?OpenDocument"">Clean Energy Standard (CES)</A></STRONG> that includes a zero-<mark>carbon</mark>-emissions credit or ZEC—the first <mark>carbon</mark> emissions credit created exclusively for nuclear power, for support to New York’s James A. <STRONG>FitzPatrick</STRONG> Nuclear Power Plant, <STRONG>Ginna</STRONG> Nuclear Power Plant, and <STRONG>Nine Mile Point</STRONG> Nuclear Generating Station.</P><P>And in December, the Illinois General Assembly passed energy and <mark>climate</mark> legislation, the <A href=""http://futureenergyjobsbill.com/"">Future Energy Jobs Bill</A>, that includes support for the <STRONG>Clinton </STRONG>Nuclear Generating Station and <STRONG>Quad Cities</STRONG> Nuclear Generating Station.</P><P>By contrast, on October 1 Entergy Corporation <A href=""https://www.palisadespower.com/palisades-power-purchase-agreement-to-end-early-nuclear-plant-to-close-in-2018/"">announced that the <STRONG>Palisades </STRONG>reactor in Michigan would permanently close in 2018</A> for economic reasons, and support for that nuclear power plant was not part of Michigan’s comprehensive 2016 energy legislation. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) <STRONG><A href=""https://www.tva.com/Newsroom/Watts-Bar-2-Project"">Watts Bar 2</A></STRONG> reactor entered commercial operation on October 19—the first new U.S. reactor to be completed this century following a decades-long pause in its construction. But also in late October, Nebraska’s nuclear power reactor <STRONG>Fort Calhoun</STRONG> shut down after the Omaha Public Power District voted in June to close the power plant for economic reasons. In November, TVA announced the sale of the <STRONG>Bellefonte</STRONG> property in Alabama to Nuclear Development, LLC for $111 million, <A href=""http://thebulletin.org/delivering-nuclear-promise-tvas-sale-bellefonte-nuclear-power-plant-site9524"">after $6 billion</A> was spent on its incomplete reactors over the last 46 years.</P><P>And the year 2016 ended with the striking news that Japan’s Toshiba conglomerate faces cost overruns in its nuclear business component that could result in a loss (writedown) of up to $4.3 billion. Toshiba paid $5.4 billion for Westinghouse Electric Co. in 2006. But in the last decade, many nuclear projects worldwide have seen cost overruns and missed project deadlines. In 2015, Toshiba had also acquired CB&amp;I Stone &amp; Webster Inc. for $229 million, a company which provides major components for AP1000 nuclear reactors under construction in Georgia and South Carolina.</P><H3>Federal Actions on Nuclear Energy in 2016</H3><P>In 2016, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) renewed nuclear power plant operating licenses at <STRONG>Braidwood</STRONG> Nuclear Power Plant in Illinois (Jan. 27), <STRONG>LaSalle</STRONG> Nuclear Plant in Illinois (Oct. 19), <STRONG>Grand Gulf</STRONG> Nuclear Plant in Mississippi (Dec. 1), and <STRONG>Fermi 2</STRONG> Nuclear Plant in Michigan (Dec. 16), and approved a power uprate for <STRONG>Catawba</STRONG> Nuclear Power Plant in South Carolina (May 4). The NRC issued a new reactor license to Duke Energy for the <STRONG>William States Lee III</STRONG> Site in South Carolina (Dec. 21).</P><P>Early in 2016, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) <A href=""https://energy.gov/articles/energy-department-announces-new-investments-advanced-nuclear-power-reactors-help-meet"">announced</A> that two companies, X-energy and Southern Company, would receive multi-year cost share awards of up to $80 million for the design, construction, and operation of non-light water reactors. Later, in June, DOE <A href=""https://energy.gov/articles/energy-department-invests-82-million-advanced-nuclear-technology"">awarded</A> $82 million more in nuclear energy technology research and development grants for 93 projects in 28 states.</P><P>In December, DOE stated that the United States commits to <A href=""https://energy.gov/articles/united-states-commits-iaea-monitoring-verifiable-disposition-six-metric-tons-surplus"">international monitoring</A> for the verifiable disposition of six tons of surplus plutonium, after Russia withdrew from a post-Cold War agreement covering excess military plutonium stockpiles earlier this year.</P><P>On nuclear waste issues, the DOE pursued an initiative to develop a <A href=""https://www.energy.gov/ne/consent-based-siting"">consent-based siting</A> for deep geologic repositories for nuclear waste, and in late December announced the re-opening of the <A href=""http://www.wipp.energy.gov/wipprecovery/recovery.html""><STRONG>Waste Isolation</STRONG> Pilot Plant</A> (WIPP) in New Mexico. In May, the NRC issued its <A href=""https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr2184/"">Final Supplement to <STRONG>Yucca Mountain</STRONG> Environmental Impact Statement</A>.</P><H3>Ramifications for Nuclear Energy</H3><P>Developments in 2016 for nuclear power in the United States should also be viewed against the backdrop of international developments in nuclear energy. These included President Obama’s <A href=""http://www.nss2016.org/"">fourth and final <STRONG>Nuclear Security Summit</STRONG></A> in late March and early April in Washington, DC, along with the 30<SUP>th</SUP> anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear accident in Ukraine, and the fifth anniversary of the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan.</P><P>The future of nuclear power in the United States remains uncertain, facing significant challenges but with continued support from the federal government and some state governments. As 2016 ended, 99 U.S. reactors produce 19.5 percent of U.S. electricity. Many of these reactors will reach the end of their current licenses and could close by mid-century. And a number of these reactors are at risk of near-term closure due to market competition and the possibility that expensive major components will need replacement. Only four reactors are currently under construction in the United States, and Toshiba’s December announcement of business losses in its nuclear enterprise creates uncertainty for these projects.</P><P>Fortunately, advances in energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies are superseding the role of nuclear power as a low-<mark>carbon</mark> energy resource.</P><P>NRDC is not opposed to nuclear power in principle.  We acknowledge its beneficial low-<mark>carbon</mark> attributes in a warming world. But we take seriously the significant safety, global security, environmental, and economic risks that this technology imposes on society. These risks call for more stringent regulation of the whole nuclear fuel cycle, from the mining and milling of uranium to reactor decommissioning and the final disposal of radioactive wastes. Until these risks are properly mitigated, expanding nuclear power should not be a leading strategy for diversifying America’s energy portfolio and reducing <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark>.</P><P>NRDC favors more practical, economical, and environmentally <mark>sustainable</mark> approaches to reducing U.S. and global <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. The focus should be on the widest possible implementation of end-use energy-efficiency improvements, and on policies to accelerate the commercialization of clean, flexible, renewable energy technologies.</P></SPAN><DIV class=""author-teaser""><H2 class=""center-title"">About the Authors</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The Sarulla geothermal power plant in Indonesia's North Sumatra, rated at approximately 110 MW, combines flash and binary technologies -- <mark>Toshiba Corp.</mark> provides the flash technology and Ormat Technologies Inc. the binary technology -- to provide a high-efficiency power plant. It is operated by Sarulla Operations Ltd.</P><P>Toshiba supplied the geothermal steam turbines and generators for the flash systems, while Ormat provided the conceptual design of the Geothermal Combined Cycle Unit power plant and supplied its Ormat Energy Converter, which serves as the condensing units for the steam turbines and utilizes the separated brine for maximum resource exploitation and maximum power output.</P><P>&quot;We are very proud to have installed our highly reliable geothermal STGs in one of the world's largest geothermal power plants. Toshiba has the number one market share in the geothermal sector. We continue to support development of power and infrastructure solutions in Indonesia,&quot; said Takao Konishi, vice president of Toshiba's Energy Systems &amp; Solutions Company.</P><P>Ormat is based in Reno, Nev. Its CEO, Isaac Angel, said that the start of commercial operation at Sarulla &quot;is a significant milestone for Ormat, both as an owner of SOL and as a supplier of our 25-year-proven binary technology. The Sarulla supply contract is the largest single contract that Ormat has signed to date. We manufactured and delivered our equipment ahead of schedule, mainly due to the improvements implemented across our entire value chain and to our professional teams. We continue to share our expertise as work continues on the second and third units of the Sarulla project that are expected to come on line by 2017 and 2018, respectively.&quot;</P><P>He added that &quot;Ormat's proven GCCU technology, which was also utilized in the Sarulla reservoir, will assure optimal and <mark>sustainable</mark> utilization of the resource to deliver to Indonesia clean, cost-effective, and baseload capacity.&quot;</P><P>Toshiba and Ormat signed a Strategic Collaboration Agreement in 2015 and won orders to supply Unit 2 of the Kizildere III Geothermal Combined Cycle Unit Power Plant in Turkey.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></FORM></BODY></HTML>"

Details of the scandal emerged the day before when an independent investigative panel released a report describing the accounting improprieties in detail. Improper accounting was found to have taken place over the course of seven years, embroiling two former CEOs in the scandal alongside Tanaka. The investigative report revealed that the CEOs did not directly instruct anyone to <A class=""termLink"" data-inlink=""link_2"" href=""/terms/c/cookthebooks.asp"">cook the books</A> but rather placed immense pressure on subordinates and waited for the <A href=""/terms/c/corporate-culture.asp"">corporate culture</A> to turn out the results they wanted.</P><H2>Toshiba: Quick Facts</H2><P><mark>Toshiba Corpo</mark>ration traces its history in Japan to 1875. The company rode the post-war Japanese boom in the late 1950s to high growth and an expanding catalog of unique and innovative products. Toshiba began selling products in foreign markets during this period and continued to expand its businesses across the globe during the following decades.</P><P>As of 2015, the <A class=""termLink"" data-inlink=""link_5"" href=""/terms/c/conglomerate.asp"">conglomerate</A> operates business units on a worldwide scale in a variety of diverse industries, including semiconductors, personal electronics, infrastructure, home appliances and medical equipment. Toshiba reported net worldwide sales of more than $63 billion for the <A class=""termLink"" data-inlink=""link_7"" href=""/terms/f/fiscalyear.asp"">fiscal year</A> ending March 31, 2015. It employs more than 200,000 people worldwide.</P><H2>Findings of the Investigative Report</H2><P>Investigators found direct evidence of inappropriate <A class=""termLink"" data-inlink=""link_8"" href=""/terms/a/accounting-practice.asp"">accounting practices</A> and overstated profits in multiple Toshiba business units, including the visual products unit, the PC unit and the <A class=""termLink"" data-inlink=""link_9"" href=""/terms/s/semiconductor.asp"">semiconductor</A> unit. The accounting misconduct began under CEO Atsutoshi Nishida in 2008 amid a <A href=""/articles/economics/09/financial-crisis-review.asp"">global financial crisis</A> that cut deeply into Toshiba's profitability. It continued unabated under the next CEO, Norio Sasaki, and eventually ended in scandal under Tanaka.</P><P>The inappropriate accounting techniques employed at Toshiba varied somewhat between the different business units. Investigators found evidence of booking future profits early, pushing back losses, pushing <A class=""termLink"" data-inlink=""link_11"" href=""/terms/b/back-charge.asp"">back charges</A> and other similar techniques that resulted in overstated profits. Although the techniques varied, the investigative panel identified a single set of direct and indirect causes to explain how the inappropriate practices took hold across the conglomerate.</P><P>Investigators describe how Toshiba's corporate leadership handed down strict <A class=""termLink"" data-inlink=""link_12"" href=""/terms/p/profit-target.asp"">profit targets</A>, known as Challenges, to business unit presidents, often with the implication that failure would not be accepted. In some cases, quarterly Challenges were handed down near the end of the quarter when there was no time left to materially affect unit performance. It soon became clear within individual business units that the only way to achieve these Challenges was to do so through the use of irregular accounting techniques.</P><P>The investigative panel concluded that Toshiba's corporate culture, which demanded obedience to superiors, was an important factor enabling the emergence of <A href=""/ask/answers/032715/what-accounting-fraud.asp"">fraudulent accounting practices</A>. The culture operated on the level of business unit presidents and on every level of authority down the chain to the <A class=""termLink"" data-inlink=""link_14"" href=""/terms/a/accountant.asp"">accountants</A> who ultimately employed the accounting techniques.</P><P>The investigative panel also pointed to weak <A href=""/terms/c/corporategovernance.asp"">corporate governance</A> and a poorly functioning system of <A class=""termLink"" data-inlink=""link_16"" href=""/terms/i/internalcontrols.asp"">internal controls</A> at every level of the Toshiba conglomerate. Internal controls in the finance division, the corporate auditing division, the <A class=""termLink"" data-inlink=""link_17"" href=""/terms/r/riskmanagement.asp"">risk management</A> division and in the securities disclosure committee did not function properly to identify and stop the inappropriate behaviors.</P><H2>Going Forward</H2><P>The investigative report includes specific recommendations to prevent the recurrence of unacceptable business practices across Toshiba's business units. These recommendations include reformation of the corporate culture, elimination of the Challenge system of profit targeting and reestablishment of internal controls and strong corporate governance. The report also recommends creation and promotion of a robust <A class=""termLink"" data-inlink=""link_18"" href=""/terms/w/whistleblower.asp"">whistleblower</A> system that employees can use without fear of retribution.</P><P>In response to the investigation, Toshiba released a statement outlining the initial actions it would take in response to the report. The company has promised to examine the results of the investigation thoroughly and to reflect the report recommendations in its business practices going forward. Toshiba further promised to announce the results of its examination process in a timely manner. At the time of this writing, no such announcements have been made.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""layout-side"" style=""opacity: 0; display:none;""><DIV class=""inner-helper""><DIV class=""box smallspace-item features widget-trending"" style=""display:none; max-height: 0;""><DIV class=""title"">

<mark>Toshiba Corpo</mark>ration
Mizuho Information &amp; Research Institute, Inc.

</P><P>TOKYO—<mark>Toshiba Corpo</mark>ration (HQ Minato-ku, Tokyo; represented by President &amp; CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa), Mizuho Information &amp; Research Institute, Inc. (MHIR, HQ in Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo; represented by President &amp; CEO Junichi Nishizawa) and 
11 other entities<SUP>*1</SUP> have been selected to carry out a major five-year project to promote clean energy generation, the &quot;Demonstration of <mark>Sustainable</mark> CCS Technology Project&quot; sponsored by Japan`s Ministry of the Environment (MOE). 
</P><P>
The consortium led by the two companies will construct a large-scale <mark>carbon</mark> capture facility that will capture <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (<mark>CO2</mark>) emitted by a thermal power plant, and evaluate the technology`s performance, cost and environmental impacts. The project will run from 2016 to 2020, and the consortium will use the results to develop policies and measures to facilitate <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage (CCS) deployment in Japan.
</P><P>
Toshiba will construct a <mark>carbon</mark> capture facility designed to capture more than 500 tons of <mark>CO2</mark> a day, about 50% of its daily emissions, from the Mikawa Power Plant (capacity: 49,000 kW) operated by Toshiba subsidiary Sigma Power Ariake Co., Ltd., 
in Omuta, Fukuoka prefecture. Mizuho and the other 11 members will investigate an environmental impact assessment method for CCS, the framework necessary for the smooth introduction of CCS in Japan, and overall CCS system appropriate to Japan. The demonstration project aims to achieve practical applications of this technology
 by 2020.
</P><P>
The Mikawa Power Plant is now being retrofitted to accommodate both coal- and biomass-fired power generation. When the demonstration facility is completed in 2020, it will become the world’s first power plant<SUP>*2</SUP> equipped with a large-scale <mark>carbon</mark> capture demonstration facility that is capable of capturing <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide from a biomass power plant.
Commenting on the project, Takao Konishi, Vice President of Toshiba’s Energy Systems &amp; Solutions Company said, “Toshiba is committed to the realization of a low-<mark>carbon</mark> society. Alongside <mark>CO2</mark>-free power generation methods, such as nuclear, renewables and hydrogen-based power, Toshiba is working on technologies for reducing <mark>CO2</mark> emissions from thermal power plants, including CCS and ultra- supercritical coal-fired thermal power generation. Through this project in Mikawa, we aim to further increase the efficiency and scale of CCS as a step toward global promotion of cleaner energy production.”
</P><P>
Yasushi Kaji, General Manager of MHIR said, &quot;MHIR will work to improve the environment for deploying CCS as a measure against <mark>climate change</mark> as well as to formulate a national policy based on the findings of this project. MHIR will advance its efforts in the field of environment and energy in order to help realize a <mark>sustainable</mark> society by assisting with policy planning, corporate management, and R&amp;D promotion.&quot;
</P><P>
CCS is a <mark>CO2</mark> reduction technology that can be applied to both new and existing thermal power plants. Along with other low-<mark>carbon</mark> technologies such as renewable energy, it is expected to help combat <mark>climate change</mark>. Toshiba and MHIR will seek to contribute to the mitigation of <mark>climate change</mark> through the early deployment of CCS in Japan and overseas.

Four of the latter are under construction in the United States, representing the only new reactors currently being built in the country. But the company was bedeviled by <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-13/toshiba-s-nuclear-reactor-mess-winds-back-to-a-louisiana-swamp"" target=""_blank"">cost overruns</A>, technical problems, conflicts with contractors, and regulatory challenges that set those projects back by years.</P><P>On Tuesday, Toshiba <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/business/toshiba-chairman-nuclear-loss.html"" target=""_blank"">projected</A> a $6.3 billion write-down for its nuclear unit and said it was looking to unload its stake. “It looked like a big deal at the time, but it’s turned into a mess,” says Michael Golay, a professor of nuclear science and engineering at MIT. “And it’s likely to have a very chilling effect.”</P><P>Toshiba’s four massive nuclear plants now under construction in the southern United States are AP1000 pressurized-water reactors, which use a simplified design that was supposed to accelerate construction. But the Vogtle project in Georgia and the V.C. Summer project in South Carolina are both around three years behind schedule and, together, billions of dollars over budget.</P><P>The company said those projects will continue, but many energy experts believe Toshiba’s decision to cease building new reactors spells the end of any nuclear construction in the United States for the foreseeable future. Analysts doubt Toshiba will find a buyer for its Westinghouse stake, or any willing construction partners to move ahead with dozens of additional plants it had once planned.</P><DIV class=""l-automated-trending--ordered"" data-widget-type=""automated-trending"" data-widget-layout=""ordered""><H5 class=""automated-trending__h"">Recommended for You</H5><OL class=""automated-trending__tz-list""><LI class=""automated-trending--ordered__tz""><DIV class=""automated-trending--ordered__tz__hgroup""><A href=""/s/611018/a-stealthy-harvard-startup-wants-to-reverse-aging-in-dogs-and-humans-could-be-next/"" class=""automated-trending--ordered__tz__story-link"" data-event-category=""recirculation"" data-event-action=""click"" data-event-label=""popular-list-right-rail"">A stealthy Harvard startup wants to reverse aging in dogs, and humans could be next</A></DIV></LI></OL></DIV><P>Toshiba’s struggles reflect the slow demise of nuclear power in much of the world (see <A href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/s/421399/giant-holes-in-the-ground/"" target=""_blank"">“Giant Holes in the Ground”</A>). The industry has been plagued by the rising cost of construction, the low price of natural gas, the Fukushima disaster in 2011, and the stricter regulations and souring public perceptions that followed. Germany is scaling down its nuclear program, engineering powerhouses like <A href=""http://www.nasdaq.com/article/ge-continues-restructuring-divests-nuclear-energy-unit-cm667688"" target=""_blank"">GE</A> and <A href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/business-14963575"" target=""_blank"">Siemens</A> have pulled back from the market, and France recently engineered the takeover of the nuclear giant Areva to rescue it after a series of stumbles.</P><P>Many fear the slowdown will prevent nations from building enough capacity to avoid the growing risks of <mark>climate change</mark>. The International Energy Agency <A href=""https://www.nei.org/News-Media/News/News-Archives/OECD-Calls-for-Doubling-of-Global-Nuclear-Capacity"" target=""_blank"">estimates</A> that nuclear energy capacity needs to double by 2050 to keep worldwide temperatures from rising more than 2 °C. Absent a <mark>carbon</mark>-capture breakthrough or a miracle battery, there’s no realistic plan for cutting greenhouse-gas emissions fast enough without far more use of nuclear, says Steven Chu, the former secretary of energy and a professor of physics at Stanford.</P><P>There is, however, something of a nuclear power renaissance under way in some parts of the world, including South Korea, Russia, India, and China. Worldwide, about 60 reactors are under construction and 160 are planned—enough to add almost half again today’s capacity, <A href=""http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/nuclear-power-in-the-world-today.aspx"" target=""_blank"">according</A> to the World Nuclear Association. China alone is building <A href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602051/fail-safe-nuclear-power/"" target=""_blank"">dozens of conventional nuclear plants</A> and forging ahead with advanced reactor designs in hopes of becoming the world’s leader in nuclear power.</P><P>Westinghouse’s <A href=""http://www.westinghousenuclear.com/New-Plants/AP1000-PWR/Overview"" target=""_blank"">1,100-megawatt AP1000 pressurized-water reactors</A> were specifically designed to be safer and easier to build than traditional nuclear plants, in part by utilizing standardized components. But plant construction has been plagued by <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/slow-reactor-safety/"" target=""_blank"">engineering setbacks</A> as well as design revisions required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</P><P>Some issues probably stemmed from mismanagement. But MIT’s Golay says Westinghouse’s problems underscore intrinsic challenges for any company attempting to develop nuclear power in the United States, including a lack of institutional expertise after decades of little construction, rigid regulatory oversight, and shrinking appetites among investors.</P><P>Getting nuclear projects moving forward again in the United States is likely to require some combination of supportive government policies and improved construction and deployment methods, says Mike Ford, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon who focuses on nuclear energy development.</P><DIV class=""callout--tagged-event-promo"" desc=""in-story-promo-mittr-subscribe""><P class=""callout__copy"">Want to go ad free?

It was one of three conventions adopted at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. To date, it has been ratified by <STRONG>195 countries</STRONG>. It started as a <STRONG>way for countries to work together to limit global temperature increases and <mark>climate change</mark></STRONG>, and to cope with their impacts.</P><P>The Council handles two issues related to the UNFCCC:</P><UL><LI>ratification of the <STRONG>Doha amendment to the Kyoto Protocol</STRONG>, which concerns commitments under the second period, running from 2013-2020</LI><LI><STRONG>Paris Agreement</STRONG> - new global <mark>climate change</mark> agreement covering all UNFCCC countries, its ratification, implementation and enter into force in 2020</LI></UL><H2>In detail</H2><H3>1. Kyoto Protocol</H3><P>In the mid 1990s, the UNFCCC signatories realised that stronger provisions were needed to reduce emissions. In 1997, they agreed the Kyoto Protocol, which introduced <B>legally binding emission reduction targets</B> for developed countries.</P><P>The <B>second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol</B> began on 1 January 2013 and will end in 2020. 38 developed countries, including the EU and its 28 member states, are participating. This second period is covered by the <B>Doha amendment</B>, under which participating countries have committed to <B>reducing emissions by at least 18% below 1990 levels</B>. The EU has committed to reducing emissions in this period to 20% below 1990 levels.</P><P>The main weakness of the Kyoto Protocol is that it <B>only requires developed countries to take action</B>. As the United States has never signed up to the Kyoto Protocol, Canada pulled out before the end of the first commitment period and Russia, Japan and New Zealand are not taking part in the second commitment period, it also <B>only now applies to around 14% of the world's emissions</B>. However, more than 70 developing and developed countries have made various <B>non-binding commitments</B> to reduce or limit their greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P>On 13 July 2015, the Council adopted a decision enabling the <B>EU to ratify the Doha amendment</B> establishing the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.</P><H3>2. Paris Agreement</H3><P>The Paris <mark>climate</mark> conference took place from 30 November to 11 December 2015.</P><P>On 12 December, the parties reached a new global agreement on <mark>climate change</mark>. The agreement presents a balanced outcome with an action plan to limit global warming 'well below' 2°C.</P><P>The Paris Agreement entered into force 4 November 2016 after the conditions for ratification by at least 55 countries accounting for at least 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions were met.

REUTERS/Fujitsu Ltd./Handout via Reuters </SPAN></SPAN></FIGCAPTION></DIV></DIV><P>Panasonic Corp, Fujitsu Ltd and others, seeking niche business opportunities to offset a downturn in demand for their consumer electronics, are touting automated greenhouses and sensor-controlled fields that ensure constant conditions to produce high-quality vegetables all year-round. </P><P>Fujitsu says its Akisai cloud-based farming system means users can sit at a desk in Tokyo or even New York while tending vegetables in Shizuoka, using a tablet to operate sprinklers, fans and heaters in response to changes in heat and moisture tracked by sensors in fields or greenhouses. </P><P>Companies are also converting factories into farms: <mark>Toshiba Corp </mark>is to start growing vegetables at a former floppy disk plant near Tokyo, while Panasonic is growing radishes and lettuce inside a Singapore factory, and Sharp Corp is trialling an indoor strawberry farm in Dubai. </P><P>This tech push into farming is endorsed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government, which is promoting robotics and sensors to boost farm production and exports – essential if Japan concedes to lower agricultural tariffs in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement. </P><P>Domestic demand for farming systems using information technology and the cloud is expected to expand ninefold to 60 billion yen ($586 million) by 2020, according to market research firm Seed Planning, as farmers fret over the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> on their crops. Last year’s summer was Japan’s hottest on record, with temperatures in Tokyo topping 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) for a week straight in early August. </P><P>“For the past 4-5 years, vegetable prices have gone up every year because of the heat,” says Takayoshi Tanizawa, the manager of Panasonic’s greenhouse project. “Farmers are in a bind because they can’t grow summer vegetables any more. They say they’ve never experienced this kind of heat before. There are also many bouts of heavy rain. Unusual weather is becoming more and more ‘normal’.”</P><DIV class=""container_1tVQo"" tabindex=""-1""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption_KoNH1""><SPAN>Leafy vegetables grow in Fujitsu's greenhouse showroom in Numazu, Shizuoka prefecture June 27, 2014.     REUTERS/Sophie Knight</SPAN></SPAN></FIGCAPTION></DIV><H3>JAPANESE MODEL </H3><P>While indoor farming has taken off in the United States and  Europe, particularly in the Netherlands, those systems are designed more for a colder <mark>climate</mark> and are only equipped with heating, rather than cooling systems. In Japan, rising electricity costs mean that energy-intensive methods, such as blasting out air conditioning, aren’t a cost-effective solution. </P><P>“The Japanese model that deals with high temperatures and humidity is more appropriate for Japan and other Asian countries,” says Yasufumi Miwa, an agricultural specialist at the Japan Research Institute. </P><P>Panasonic has developed a “passive”, low-energy greenhouse that uses sensor-activated fans, sprinklers and curtains instead of air conditioning to keep heat and humidity at a constant - whether it’s January or July. Fujitsu similarly offers solar-powered posts equipped with thermometers, humidity sensors and cameras for farmers’ fields. </P><P>Greenhouses cover 11 percent of the land used to cultivate vegetables in Japan, but account for 15 percent of total output, or 165 billion yen ($1.6 billion), and farmers who use them can have double the revenue of those who use open fields as they more consistently produce high-quality vegetables. </P><P>Although Panasonic’s greenhouses aren’t cheap, at 55 million yen ($540,000) for a set of ten, the company says the cost can be recouped within seven years, and estimates it is half the price of a system using air conditioning. A constant temperature can double harvests to eight a year, says Panasonic, which aims to sell 1,000 of its greenhouses by the year ending March 2017 and hopes the system will eventually be used to produce a tenth of Japan’s spinach output, or 26,000 tons. </P><P>High-tech systems that can produce higher-quality premium vegetables could give Japanese farmers the competitive edge they will need if the country joins the TPP, the free trade agreement it’s negotiating with 11 other countries.  </P><DIV class=""container_1tVQo"" tabindex=""-1""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption_KoNH1""><SPAN>Sensors measuring temperature and humidity are seen at a test site for Fujitsu's cloud-based farming system in Numazu, Shizuoka prefecture June 27, 2014.    REUTERS/Sophie Knight </SPAN></SPAN></FIGCAPTION></DIV><P>“It’s like semiconductors ... the low-cost ones have to be sold at high-volume to keep costs low, whereas Japan’s semiconductor industry is about developing the next generation and to add value,” said Takeshi Sudo, senior vice president of innovative business development at Fujitsu.  </P><H3>YOUNG BLOOD </H3><P>Low on effort and high on tech, Fujitsu’s Akisai system is designed to attract young blood into a sector where the average Japanese farmer is 66 years old. Using big data to analyze <mark>climate</mark> against output over a year can help newcomers understand what conditions are ideal: one test user increased his revenue by 30 percent and used nearly one-third less fertilizer. </P><P>Fujitsu says it has around 200 customers for the Akisai system which it launched in 2012, including supermarket retailer Aeon Co Ltd, which uses it to grow and time the distribution of perfectly ripe vegetables from 15 farms straight to stores. It aims to reap 15 billion yen ($150 million) in revenue by the year to end-March 2016. </P><P>And the system hasn’t ignored the meat industry either. </P><P>As Japan’s government hopes to expand beef exports fivefold by 2020, Fujitsu has come up with an anklet for heifers - which could be the world’s first wearable for cows. </P><P>The Gyuho, or ‘cow step’, pedometer can pinpoint when a heifer is most fertile based on how much she walks around. The farmer is sent an email alert so he can rush to artificially inseminate the cow and have a higher chance of meeting the target of one calf per year - a big potential improvement when a head of cattle can fetch up to $5,000 at auction. </P><P>“Before, you’d either have to get on top of the cow and see if she objected or not, or else check the floor to see if there were a lot of hoofprints,” said Hiroshi Kadomatsu, a beef farmer in Miyazaki prefecture in southern Japan. </P><P>“I’m not quite at 100 percent success rate with Gyuho yet, but it’s certainly a lot better than before.”</P><DIV class=""container_28wm1""><DIV class=""attribution_o4ojT""><P class=""content_27_rw"">Editing by Ian Geoghegan</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

	The Toshiba facility in Yokosuka, a port town on Tokyo Bay south of Yokohama, looks like a lot of other Japanese factories from the outside: quiet with neatly kept grounds, its low-rise whitewashed buildings built for utility rather than beauty. All-in-all pretty nondescript. But here, appearances definitely are deceptive.</P><P>
	Step off the elevator on the corner of the fourth floor of one of the buildings, and corridors run away left and right, both 50 meters or so. Take a few steps in either direction, and windows on the interior walls reveal the building’s secret. Bursts of green against white, rows after row of green in different shades and different sizes. The building is home to <mark>Toshiba Corpo</mark>ration’s first plant factory.</P><P>
	Toshiba is making a concerted effort to build a strong presence in the burgeoning healthcare market, and the plant factory showcases the progress the company is making—and just what technology has to contribute.</P><P>
	Whatever its causes, <mark>climate change</mark> is set to cut a swathe through some of the world’s most fertile regions, raising a lot of questions about the future of agriculture. There are other concerns too, chief among them population growth, which will impose more demands on land and water, and the increasing scale of natural disasters, particularly severe rain and flooding. In coming years, as the challenges pile up, <mark>innovation</mark> needs to come to the fore.</P><P>
	Toshiba’s plant factory is one such <mark>innovation</mark>. Of course, hydroponics—growing plants in a liquid, without soil—is hardly new. What is new is the level of know-how that Toshiba brings to the process.</P><P>
	The Yokosuka facility is a closed environment installed in a class 8 clean room. Filters clean the air pumped into the growing area, while water purifiers allow use of ordinary water fortified with nutrients. This ensures an almost aseptic environment that cuts germs on the vegetables to a thousandth that of the same vegetables grown outdoors. Not only are they free of bugs and agrichemical, they are also healthier and stay fresh for longer. And that is just the beginning.</P><P>
	Technologies used at Yokosuka draw on capabilities from across Toshiba Group. Entry to the clean room is via corridors coated with Rene Cat, a light activated antibacterial and deodorizer. A hypochlorous acid water machine delivers the disinfectant that employees use to wash their hands before entering the growing area. Once inside, fluorescent tubes output light at a wavelength optimized for growing vegetables, and the air-conditioning system maintains a constant temperature. A remote monitoring system networks the plant and tracks plant growth, and once the daily crop is ready for pick, UV sterilization systems for packing materials ensure that produce reaching customers is as clean as when harvested. All of this is supported by clean room management system largely based on semiconductor production.</P><P>
	The growing room has a floor area approaching 2,000 square meters. At one end, staff swathed in coveralls, head covers and masks deftly place seeds in germination trays. As the seedlings emerge and the plants grow, they are moved through the facility at planned intervals, from smaller to bigger racks, until they are ready for harvesting and packing. The whole process takes about a month. The current crop line-up includes romaine and frillice lettuces, baby spinach, Swiss chard and mizuna, a Japanese favorite. However, Toshiba has already proved that it can grow other plants, and is ready to supply customers with basil, coriander and dill if the demand is there.</P><P><STRONG>Putting seeds into germinating trays in the clean room</STRONG></P><P>Following months of testing and calibration, the plant has been delivering output since November, and has the capacity to grow the equivalent of 3 million heads of lettuce a year. That’s a lot of salad—and there’s a lot more to that salad. In the controlled environment Toshiba has created, it’s possible to create functional vegetables that are low in potassium and rich in vitamins and polyphenols, which are seen as helping to prevent cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and osteoporosis. Even better, the vegetables also taste good, with a full, natural taste deeper than that of a lot of supermarket-bought veggies.</P><P><STRONG>Ready to eat—fresh, crisp and very tasty</STRONG></P><P>In February 2014, Toshiba announced a four-pronged strategy for building on its world-class position in diagnostic imaging systems (MRI, CT, etc.) and expanding its presence in the healthcare market. The company is focusing on prevention to reduce risk of disease; diagnosis and treatment to achieve early detection and stress-free treatment regimes; prognosis and nursing care to support patients and convalescents; and health promotion that helps people to lead happier lives and remain mentally and physically fit by ensuring the quality of the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat.</P><P>
	The plant factory falls under health promotion, and shines a light on how technology can deliver solutions. Similar facilities in Middle Eastern countries might not green deserts, but they could establish a local source of green vegetables for countries with little arable land; and in Northern Europe they could help to make up for short growing seasons and long winters. In both cases, they could help to cut exports and all the related costs and logistics. In emerging economies, where cities continue to grow and suck people from the countryside, they could be integrated into new buildings, bringing farms into the city.</P><P>
	Of course, that is looking into the future, and looking quite a long way. But that is what Toshiba is doing: taking a long hard look at the way the world is changing and seeking to create imaginative solutions that draw on the wide ranging capabilities of Toshiba Group as a whole. In Toshiba, the impetus for this is known as New Concept <mark>Innovation</mark>, and it supports the company in working toward its vision of the future, the creation of a Human Smart Community where people everywhere live safe, secure, comfortable lives. Not a bad objective.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""span3 sidebar hidden-print""><ASIDE><DIV class=""section share clearfix""><H3 class=""""><SPAN class=""translation_missing"" title=""translation missing: en.layouts.public.share"">Share</SPAN></H3></DIV></ASIDE></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The project was initially expected to produce power in 2016. </P><P>The decision by Southern Co’s Georgia Power Co affiliate must be approved by the state’s utility regulator. A decision is expected by February. </P><P>The project’s future became uncertain after Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy in March and said it could not complete its fixed-price contract for the plant. </P><P>Georgia Power highlighted in a statement Vogtle’s promise to provide clean, stable power for up to 80 years. However, the company also said capital costs to finish the project will total $9.45 billion and ratepayer groups have already mounted campaigns to kill the project.  </P><P>Vogtle and a similar twin-reactor project in South Carolina known as V.C. Summer were approved a decade ago, and were seen at the time as the dawn of a new era of U.S. nuclear power plant construction. </P><P>Both so-called AP1000 plants were designed and being constructed by Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse, a subsidiary of <mark>Toshiba Corp </mark>of Japan, and were touted as quicker to build and safer than prior plants.    Since then, however, cheap natural gas flooded the market, the Fukushima accident in Japan dampened enthusiasm for nuclear power and the Trump administration is now unwinding steps aimed at countering <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>Both plants were also dogged by massive setbacks and cost overruns. </P><P>In July, the V.C. Summer project was scrapped by its owners SCANA Corp and state utility Santee Cooper. </P><P>Unlike V.C. Summer, Vogtle had a larger corporate backer in Southern Co and a $3.68 billion settlement with Toshiba, which promised only $2.2 billion for failing to complete the South Carolina project. </P><P>Resolving Vogtle’s future should bolster the image of Westinghouse’s cutting-edge AP1000 design and creates a customer for the company’s services business. </P><P>That services business, along with a unit that manufactures nuclear fuel products, generated around $400 million of cash flow in the last fiscal year before bankruptcy and the company has described them as “very profitable” in court records. </P><P>With Southern’s commitment to Vogtle, Westinghouse is expected to focus on finding a buyer and is expected to attract interest of U.S. private equity investors. </P><P>Southern Co cautioned that the success of Vogtle hinges on ailing Toshiba making good on its settlement, which will be paid in installments, and U.S. lawmakers extending production tax credits. </P><P>Vogtle’s success also depends the Department of Energy extending loans to help finance construction. </P><P>Georgia Power said Bechtel, a San Francisco-based engineering company, would manage construction.  </P><DIV class=""container_28wm1""><DIV class=""attribution_o4ojT""><P class=""content_27_rw"">Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Del.; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Matthew Lewis</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>As is so often the case with corporate scandals, establishing responsibility proves a slippery task. Then-CEO Martin Winterkorn took five days to resign, accepting responsibility only with the caveat “<A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/23/volkswagen-ceo-martin-winterkorn-quits-over-diesel-emissions-scandal"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">I am not aware of any wrongdoing on my part</A>”. Under the new leadership of Matthias Müller, VW says it has made progress in its search to understand what went on. A <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/dec/10/volkswagen-emissions-scandal-german-carmaker"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">“chain of errors”</A> is the unsatisfying conclusion so far, with blame pinned on weak processes, “misconduct and shortcomings”, and some overly-tolerant “mindsets”. </P><P>VW’s dodgy emissions tests speak to a broader problem of people’s trust in businesses. When businesses abuse their position and indulge in <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/<mark>sustainable</mark>-business/2015/oct/13/how-companies-can-keep-the-faith-on-<mark>climate</mark>-change"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">dangerous greenwashing</A> they undermine any company’s attempts to advocate for <mark>climate change</mark> action and responsible business.</P><P>Consistently pitching itself as a champion of corporate responsibility, VW topped the Dow Jones Sustainability Index as the most <mark>sustainable</mark> car maker just before the scandal broke, with <A href=""http://www.volkswagenag.com/content/vwcorp/info_center/en/news/2015/09/sustain.html"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Winterkorn saying</A> “the Volkswagen Group is well on the way to establishing itself long term as the world’s most <mark>sustainable</mark> automaker”. It now faces multiple investigations, including from the European parliament, and potentially tens of billions of euros in fines.</P><H2>Exxon: “no corporation has ever done anything ... this bad”</H2><P>If VW was villain of the year, some are suggesting that oil and gas behemoth <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/exxonmobil"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">ExxonMobil</A> is the villain of our lifetime.</P><P>An Inside <mark>Climate</mark> News <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/14/exxons-<mark>climate</mark>-lie-change-global-warming"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">investigation</A> in September into internal Exxon documents revealed that the company’s own research had warned of the dangers of man-made <mark>climate change</mark> <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/08/exxon-<mark>climate</mark>-change-1981-<mark>climate</mark>-denier-funding"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">as early as 1981</A>. Rather than start a debate about how to transition to a low <mark>carbon</mark> economy, the company chose instead to <A href=""http://www.exxonsecrets.org/maps.php"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">plough more than $30m</A> (£20.3m) into <mark>climate</mark> denial, according to Greenpeace figures. For a long time it ran a campaign of misinformation, insisting that <mark>climate</mark> science remained uncertain, and even now it <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/<mark>sustainable</mark>-business/2015/sep/03/exxonmobil-oil-gas-renewable-energy-china-brazil-russia-citizenship-report"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">dismisses the possibility of a low-<mark>carbon</mark> future</A> any time soon.</P><P>The scandal is so significant because it is now clear that the richest company in America’s history had a choice. It could have engaged with its own research, opened up a public debate about the implications of <mark>climate change</mark> and looked at how to adapt its business model to meet the oncoming crisis. Or, as it chose to do, it could bury its head in the sand, invest in denial, minimise the potential of renewables and claim the future lies in oil and gas. </P><ASIDE class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded"" data-component=""rich-link"" data-link-name=""rich-link-1 | 1""><DIV class=""rich-link""><DIV class=""rich-link__container""><DIV class=""rich-link__header""><H1 class=""rich-link__title"">Top sustainability stories of 2015 – in pictures</H1></DIV><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more""><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more-text"">

</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ASIDE><P>According to Bill McKibben: “Businesses misbehave all the time, but VW is the flea to Exxon’s elephant. <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/14/exxons-<mark>climate</mark>-lie-change-global-warming"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">No corporation has ever done anything this big and this bad</A>.”</P><H2><mark>Climate</mark> lobbying – the gap between words and action</H2><P>In a year that saw the Paris <mark>climate</mark> talks and negotiations on two global trade agreements – the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (<A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/05/trans-pacific-partnership-deal-reached-pacific-countries-international-trade"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">TTP</A>) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (<A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/03/ttip-what-why-angry-transatlantic-trade-investment-partnership-guide"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">TTIP</A>) – it’s perhaps not surprising that <mark>climate</mark> lobbying was such a big feature of 2015. According to <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/<mark>sustainable</mark>-business/2015/apr/15/big-business-trade-groups-lobby-against-eu-<mark>climate</mark>-change"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">data</A> from the environmental non-profit CDP, 77% of the largest 500 companies in the world say they use trade associations to lobby on <mark>climate policy</mark>.</P><P> A Policy Studies Institute (PSI) investigation in March found that multinational companies eager to tout their sustainability credentials were also members of influential trade associations <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/<mark>sustainable</mark>-business/2015/apr/15/big-business-trade-groups-lobby-against-eu-<mark>climate</mark>-change"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">lobbying against EU <mark>climate policy</mark></A>. PSI looked at groups such as BusinessEurope, which has argued <mark>climate</mark> policies will undermine competitiveness, and the European Chemical Council, which argued that strengthening the EU Emissions Trading System would lead to businesses moving overseas for lower energy costs.</P><P>Armed with this research, NGO ShareAction launched its <A href=""http://www.shareaction.org/clean-words-dirty-lobby"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">“clean words, dirty lobby”</A> campaign aiming to force companies to stand up to their rhetoric on <mark>climate change</mark> and stop funding trade associations working to weaken <mark>climate policy</mark>. In September, ShareAction organised a group of 25 investors with more than €61bn (£45bn) in assets to write to multinationals including BP, Glencore and Proctor &amp; Gamble asking them to <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/<mark>sustainable</mark>-business/2015/sep/10/bp-edf-proctor-gamble-face-pressure-over-<mark>climate</mark>-change-lobbying"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">justify their membership of big EU trade associations</A>.</P><P>There is movement from companies. Shell announced in August that it was cutting ties with the rightwing American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec) because of its denial of <mark>climate change</mark> and last year Unilever split from BusinessEurope, reportedly for similar reasons. </P><P>Multinational companies have enormous power and influence and will have a key role in shaping <mark>climate policy</mark>. While many made bold pledges in 2015 in the run up to the Paris talks (Ikea, for example, <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/04/ikea-pledges-1bn-on-renewable-energy-and-<mark>climate</mark>-change-efforts"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">promised €1bn</A> to fight <mark>climate change</mark>), the continued existence of cosy, secretive lobbying threatens to undermine action we need to avoid catastrophic <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><H2>Brazil mining tragedy</H2><P>Brazil’s government called it the “worst environmental disaster in Brazil’s history”. In November, a tailings dam in the Brazilian mining state of Minas Gerais <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/<mark>sustainable</mark>-business/2015/nov/25/brazils-mining-tragedy-dam-preventable-disaster-samarco-vale-bhp-billiton"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">burst causing a huge and devastating mudflow</A>. The 60m cubic meters of mine waste (equivalent to 25,000 Olympic swimming pools) killed at least 13 people and left hundreds homeless as it swept through villages and polluted the 800km River Doce, depriving local people of their water source and killing thousands of fish.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

The project is also at least five years behind its original schedule.</P><P>SCANA, the lead partner with a 55 percent stake, said completing the plants on its own would be “prohibitively expensive.” The reactors were being built at the Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station in Jenkinsville, S.C., which has one reactor. The two utilities said they would ask the Public Service Commission of South Carolina to approve a plan to abandon the project. About 5,000 construction workers have been on the job. </P><P>The United States has 99 nuclear reactors, but only one new nuclear power reactor has been completed since the 1980s. And none had begun construction since an accident at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island site in March 1979 gave regulators and utilities pause. In 1986, disaster struck the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine, killing 30 within weeks, making many more ill and contaminating a wide area. </P><P>But a wave of optimism about electricity demand and nuclear reactor designs fueled new proposals in the early 2000s. And federal production tax credits and loan guarantees also have been designed to promote new projects. The V.C. Summer reactors were part of a proposal made in 2008. </P><P>If they had come online by 2021, the V.C. Summer reactors would have benefited from federal production tax credits. That would have been plenty of time with the original schedule; the first plant was due to come online in 2016 and the second in 2019. But that appears impossible now, and neither Congress nor the Trump administration has acted to extend the deadline for the credits. </P><P>During the administration’s “energy week,” Energy Secretary Rick Perry said that “this administration believes that nuclear energy development can be a game-changer and an important player in the development of our clean-energy portfolio globally.” Yet the Trump budget proposal would slash nuclear research and development.</P><P>Although the Trump administration has touted the benefits of nuclear power, the completion of the reactors would have created competition for coal-fired power plants in the region, undercutting a key Trump goal. An analysis by Michael Shellenberger, president of an independent group called Environmental Progress, says that V.C. Summer reactors would reduce coal generation in South Carolina by 86 percent, an amount of coal that produces <mark>pollution</mark> equivalent to 3.8 million cars.</P><P>Special provisions in South Carolina and Georgia allow utilities to charge ratepayers for a portion of power projects before they come online, a controversial way for private utilities to raise capital. South Carolina ratepayers already have kicked in $1.4 billion through surcharges on their monthly bills.</P><P>“We simply cannot ask our customers to pay for a project that has become uneconomical,” Lonnie Carter, the president and chief executive of Santee Cooper, said in a statement. “And even though suspending construction is the best option for them, we are disappointed that our contractor has failed to meet its obligations and put Santee Cooper and our customers in this situation.”</P><P>Santee Cooper said that Westinghouse’s parent, <mark>Toshiba Corp.</mark>, has contractually agreed to pay Santee Cooper $976 million in a settlement beginning later this year and continuing through 2022. Santee Cooper will use that money to avoid new debt and stabilize customers’ rates. The company said it will continue to pursue Westinghouse’s assets in bankruptcy court to obtain further payment. </P><P>SCANA chief executive Kevin Marsh said in a statement that “many factors outside our control have changed since inception of this project.” He said that “chief among them” was “the bankruptcy of our primary construction contractor, Westinghouse.”</P><P>In a conference call with analysts Monday, Marsh said the company had sought other partners and government assistance but found none. </P><P>Nuclear energy is expanding more abroad, especially in fast-growing China, which has 36 nuclear reactors and 21 others under construction, according to the World Nuclear Association. But it has been easier to meet financial hurdles because the plants are built by state-owned companies and the cost of capital is heavily subsidized by the government. </P><P>That could create opportunity for salvaging some of the equipment already delivered to the South Carolina site, said SCANA’s Marsh. He said the utilities would maintain the equipment in case a buyer using the same Westinghouse design emerges. Selling the equipment for scrap would be less beneficial than simply taking a tax write-off. </P><P>But with Westinghouse mired in bankruptcy court and its parent Toshiba financially strapped, it isn’t clear whether the AP1000 design will be used again. Any foreign company seeking to buy the design would need approval from the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. </P></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""moat-trackable pb-f-theme-normal pb-f-dehydrate-false pb-f-async-false full pb-feature pb-layout-item pb-f-article-article-author-bio"" moat-id=""article/article-author-bio|business"" data-chain-name=""no-name"" data-feature-name=""no-name"" data-feature-id=""article/article-author-bio"" data-pb-fingerprint=""0f7Y1cjOKqD"" id=""fUpLQ61uzH1kSq""><DIV class=""pb-bottom-author-wrapper border-bottom-hairline border-bottom-100-pct""><DIV class=""pb-bottom-author""><DIV class=""pb-author-info col-sm-offset-2""><DIV class=""pb-author-bio"">Steven Mufson covers energy and other financial matters.

Google Inc. recently added its name to a growing list of corporations looking for alternatives to electric service from Nevada utility NV Energy.</P><P>
The tech giant filed a petition with the Nevada Public Utilities Commission on April 25 asking for direction on how a new electric customer should go about obtaining permission to use a supplier alternative to NV Energy.</P><P>
Over the last year, a series of high-profile electricity customers of the utility had applied for -- and in the case of MGM Resorts International, Wynn Resorts Ltd. and Switch were granted -- permission to stop buying their electricity from the utility under a 2001 energy crisis-era law. That route required the companies to pay notable exit fees, $87 million in the case of MGM, in order to do so.</P><STRONG><A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>central.org/news/indian-solar-undercutting-fossil-fuels-21442"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow""><mark>Climate</mark> Central</A>: Indian Solar Prices Hit New Low, Undercutting Fossil Fuels</STRONG><P>
Wholesale solar power prices have reached another record low in India, faster than analysts predicted and further undercutting the price of fossil fuel-generated power in the country.</P><P>
The tumbling price of solar energy also increases the likelihood that India will meet -- and by its own predictions, exceed -- the renewable energy targets it set at the Paris <mark>climate</mark> accords in December 2015.</P><P>
India is the world’s third-largest <mark>carbon</mark> polluter, with emissions forecast to at least double as it seeks to develop its economy and lift hundreds of millions of citizens out of poverty.</P><P>
Ensuring it generates as much of that energy as possible from renewable sources is considered crucial to limiting catastrophic global temperature increases.</P><STRONG><A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/05052017/paris-agreement-<mark>climate</mark>-change-donald-trump-jared-kushner-steve-bannon-clean-power-plan"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Inside<mark>Climate</mark> News</A>: Inside the White House War Over the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Treaty</STRONG><P>
Like Jean Valjean in the sewers, the White House is racing to elude the authorities of Paris, the city that gave its name to the binding 2015 treaty enlisting all nations to address the world's <mark>climate change</mark> crisis.</P><P>
Put simply, President Donald Trump faces a choice between two routes -- one marked rejection, the other revision -- as he seeks to fulfill his campaign pledge to &quot;cancel&quot; the treaty.</P><P>
That he has this choice stems from two competing impulses that shaped the text of the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement as nations sought to make it both effective and flexible.</P><P>
The delicate balance they struck was to make the document binding but not compulsory, ambitious but not rigid. Now, that compromise is being manipulated by two factions, the rejectionists and the revisionists, inside the White House.</P><STRONG><A href=""http://www.postandcourier.com/business/reports-of-impending-toshiba-bankruptcy-raise-new-doubts-about-s/article_86a02b3c-35b7-11e7-a195-1fa7bc44ac18.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">The Post and Courier</A>: Reports of Impending Toshiba Bankruptcy Raise New Doubts About South Carolina Nuclear Project</STRONG><P>
The utilities building new reactors at a Midlands nuclear plant aren't saying what impact a potential <mark>Toshiba Corp.</mark> bankruptcy filing could have on the troubled construction project, even as more questions are being raised about the Japanese conglomerate's financial health.</P><P>
&quot;We haven’t been informed about a Toshiba bankruptcy filing, and we won’t speculate about one,&quot; Rhonda O'Banion, spokesperson for South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas parent SCANA Corp., said this week.</P><P>
Toshiba's business partners told <EM>The Wall Street Journal</EM> that they are bracing for a bankruptcy filing that could wipe out many of the Tokyo firm's commitments, including a guarantee to pay up to $1.7 billion in cost overruns at the V.C. Summer Nuclear Station in Jenkinsville.</P><STRONG><A href=""http://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/energy/policy/how-much-does-the-us-government-subsidize-electricity-generating-technologies"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">IEEE Spectrum</A>: How Much Does the U.S. Government Subsidize Electricity Generating Technologies?</STRONG><P>
Exactly what is a subsidy, who pays for them, and who benefits? Everybody in the energy business has an opinion but few people agree on any one answer. The American Petroleum Institute, an oil and gas trade association, offers a fact sheet arguing that their industry isn’t subsidized; the Nuclear Energy Institute offers an analysis that reaches contrary conclusions. Renewables either receive disproportionate largess or are underfunded, depending on whom you ask.</P><P>
These questions incite cross-talk, not cross-tabulation. But we elected to do the latter as part of a comprehensive, interdisciplinary research project called the Full Cost of Electricity (FCe-) conducted by the University of Texas at Austin Energy Institute. Our analysis of energy subsidies aims to estimate the magnitude of federal financial support offered to various electricity supply chains and technologies -- gas turbines, nuclear power plants, wind turbines -- from mine-mouth to wall socket.</P></STRONG></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

For this they need to be publicly exposed, as this book does.An interesting dimension for me is in the divergent cultures within Exxon at the time. Major companies are rarely ideological monoliths; they are usually collections of competing agendas. However, it is clear that the environmental responsibility message did not filter through to the next generation of corporate executives, much to the shame of Exxon. It could have taken the road to corporate leadership but failed. It is not just the company who is worse off for this, it is the colossal task facing the world community to stem the tide of <mark>climate</mark> damaging emissions that Exxon, and companies like them, are largely responsible for.The message of the book: Exxon knew that its emissions would raise the temperature of the planet, and they knew that this could cause enormous challenges, if not make the world uninhabitable for the types of societies we have built. But they took the cheap road and failed in moral leadership. Shame on them.Final comment on the book; because it is a collection of essays, the narrative does not flow as well as it could. Therefore as a literary piece it is not going to win any prizes. But as an expose, it is very good.</DIV></DIV></SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

    </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Toshiba has achieved an advance in photo-electrochemical processing that converts <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide directly into ethylene glycol with an efficiency of 0.48%. Ethylene glycol is a useful and versatile industrial raw material that can be used to manufacture polyester fibers, PET bottles and antifreeze formulations.
                                </P></DIV><P>The high conversion rate is due to Toshiba's development of a silicon-based photovoltaic cell as the electricity source for a molecular catalyst to electrochemically reduce <A href=""https://phys.org/tags/<mark>carbon</mark>+dioxide/"" rel=""tag"" class=""textTag""><mark>carbon</mark> dioxide</A> in an aqueous solution and convert it into <A href=""https://phys.org/tags/ethylene+glycol/"" rel=""tag"" class=""textTag"">ethylene glycol</A>. The technology was presented at the PRiME 2016 international conference held in Honolulu, Hawaii, on October 2-7, 2016.</P><P>Rising concentrations of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere are recognized by the International Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> and other expert bodies as a primary cause of <mark>climate change</mark>, and this, along with growing concerns for fossil fuels, is stimulating efforts to develop renewable and low-<mark>carbon</mark> energy sources. In parallel, efforts are also being made around the world to develop photo-electrochemical cell technology for converting <mark>CO2</mark> into chemical energy, as a countermeasure against both <mark>climate change</mark> and fossil-fuel concerns.</P><P>Previously reported electrochemical catalyst have converted <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide into two-electron reduction products, such as <mark>carbon</mark> monoxide and formic acid, stimulating a search for catalysts that support more complex reduction reactions and produce a multi-electron reduction substances. This approach is seen in the use of a copper catalyst to trigger direct conversion into hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s. However, this approach also generates a large quantity of by-products, a problem in itself.</P><FIGURE class=""image-block""><FIGCAPTION class=""image-block-caption"">

    </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Toshiba's work in molecular catalysts has led to the development of a photo-electrochemical system (patent pending) that uses a silicon-based photovoltaic cell as the source of electricity for molecular catalysts to electrochemically reduce <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide into ethylene glycol. Conversion to ethylene glycol using the photo-electrochemical system produces an energy conversion <A href=""https://phys.org/tags/efficiency/"" rel=""tag"" class=""textTag"">efficiency</A> of 0.48%.</P><P>The newly developed catalyst is an imidazolium salt derivative adsorbed at high density onto a metal surface. When <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide molecules interact with the derivative, a reaction not previously achieved occurs, a result attributed to the molecular catalyst promoting both a direct reaction with the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and serving as a reaction field for multi-electron reduction reactions.</P><P>The ethylene glycol generated by the system is a valuable and versatile industrial raw material that can be used in the manufacture of PET bottles, polyester fibers and resins. Toshiba will continue to develop the technology, targeting commercialization of a highly efficient system for producing industrial raw materials by the 2020s.

				</A></LI></ARTICLE></DIV><DIV class=""entry"" id=""jtarticle""><P>An accounting scandal engulfing Japanese conglomerate <mark>Toshiba Corp.</mark> has exposed how closed corporate culture, still prevalent even at globally well-known companies in the country, plagues corporate governance.</P><P>In the country’s worst accounting scandal in years, a third-party panel concluded that Toshiba’s top management had “pressured” employees to achieve ambitious profit targets, saying that a corporate culture that did not allow subordinates to oppose their bosses was behind the dodgy bookkeeping.</P><P>It also criticized the Japanese conglomerate’s excessive focus on producing numbers. The panel reported that the firm’s “systematic” inflation of profits totaled ¥151.8 billion over nearly seven years.</P><P>The scandal sent out shock waves as Toshiba had been seen as one of the leading companies in the area of corporate governance.</P><P>The scandal comes to light at a time when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is seeking to draw more foreign investment. Japan’s new corporate governance code, introduced in June, encourages companies to appoint multiple outside directors.</P><P>Amid the presence of assertive shareholders demanding companies quickly improve profitability, analysts say that top management in Japan has become more profit-centric.</P><P>But a corporate culture like Toshiba’s, with its focus on subordinating employees, is not unique in a country where conformity in organizations and lifetime employment are treasured.</P><P>To bring about a change in the rigid corporate structure, experts say promoting diversity would help bring new perspectives and enhance transparency and thus contribute to corporate growth over the long term.</P><P>“(Japan’s) corporate culture encourages you to take the same action as others, and makes you believe that maintaining the status quo is the right thing to do. It’s really hard to change,” said Yamato Sato, professor of management at the Faculty of Business and Commerce of Keio University.</P><P>“When people with different views come to an organization, they may face resistance at first. But accepting them will also allow the organization to find and fix what may be wrong with it,” Sato added.</P><P>A growing number of Japanese companies are aware of the need to promote diversity as they further globalize, but the change is coming slowly.</P><P>One of the reasons is that few companies see diversity management as a long-term investment that will enhance corporate value, experts say.</P><P>Domestic debate about diversity management has gradually gained momentum over the last two decades or so. Diversity in Japan is often synonymous with promoting women to managerial posts and hiring more non-Japanese executives.</P><P>Nissan Motor Corp., a Renault S.A. affiliate led by President and Chief Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn since 2001, is a rare example.</P><P>The graying of Japan’s population has encouraged more and more Japanese companies to look overseas for growth. Finding the right talent for their operations in the increasingly competitive global market is more important than ever.</P><P>Mitsuyo Matsubara, visiting professor of the Faculty of Economics at Gakushuin University, said promoting diversity is inevitable as globalization progresses and the number of cross-border mergers and acquisitions by Japanese companies increases. But she said Japanese companies by and large remain conservative in managing human resources.</P><P>“Japanese companies still emphasize Japaneseness rather than diverse perspectives when it comes to human resources management,” said Matsubara, who specializes in diversity management.</P><P>Japanese firms should go beyond hiring more foreign nationals, experts say. They should promote diversity at various organizational levels.</P><P>Toyota Motor Corp.’s promotion of Julie Hamp as its first female managing officer in April was a symbolic development, though she stepped down about three months later following her arrest on suspicion of illegally importing a narcotic painkiller into Japan.</P><P>Toyota Managing Officer Tetsuya Otake told a recent news conference that the Japanese automaker will “put the right people in the right posts regardless of nationality, gender and age to respect diversity,” and become a truly global company.</P><P>Corporate managers may need to create a work environment for diverse people, encourage them to express candid opinions and build a consensus rather than avoiding conflicts of opinions, the experts say.</P><P>Keio University professor Sato said Japanese companies have been increasingly seeking to set up a mechanism to strengthen corporate governance over the years, but he questioned its effectiveness in imposing proper checks.</P><P>One such step is to have outside directors — already a common practice among globally operating Japanese firms — but there have been questions about whether the right people are in the job.</P><P>At Toyo Tire &amp; Rubber Co. mired in a product data falsification scandal, for instance, the company did not disclose the problem until a year after suspicions first surfaced in February 2014 that its quake shock absorbers did not meeting government requirements. No one blew the whistle before the disclosure in March this year.</P><P>A team of outside lawyers who investigated the matter concluded that Toyo’s top executives knew about the data-rigging by August 2014, tracing the problem to its corporate culture. The company at the time had three outside directors and four auditors.</P><P>“If we appoint outside directors, for example, what is important is who they are,” not the fact of having them, Sato said.</P><P>“It depends on whether top leaders are serious about changing their organizations and making it (the governance system) work,” he added.</P><DIV class=""jtarticle_related""><H3 class=""jtarticle_related_ttl"">LATEST BUSINESS STORIES</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Major electronics manufacturer <mark>Toshiba Corp.</mark> and Toshiba Fuel Cell Power Systems Corp., a Toshiba Group company, announced December 20, 2011, that they would be offering city gas companies and liquefied petroleum gas sales companies a new household fuel cell product line called Ene-Farm, starting in March 2012. </P><P>Toshiba says that, compared to the condition without Ene-Farm, the product has the world's highest overall efficiency rating of 94 percent, emits 1.5 fewer tons of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (<mark>CO2</mark>), and saves 61,000 yen (U.S.$792) in energy costs annually. The use of fewer and lower-cost components brought the cost down to 20% below existing models. Also, its smaller size requires a footprint of only 1.9 square meters for installation, and Toshiba says its durability is the industry's longest, lasting 80,000 hours.</P><P>A special feature of this new household fuel cell is that the same model can work on different types of gas (city gas, liquefied petroleum gas, and Japanese domestic natural gas). This versatility, unmatched by competitors, will help boost the popularity overall the Ene-Farm residential fuel cells, the company says.</P><P>

Approximately half of the world’s nuclear power reactors are based on Westinghouse technology.</P><P>In 2006, when Toshiba bought Westinghouse for $5.4 billion, the seller projected that by 2020 the global market for nuclear power generation was expected to have grown by 50 percent.</P><P><STRONG>Related:</STRONG><A href=""http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sd-utbg-nuclear-power-schultz-20170428-story.html"" target=""_blank"">Do we need clean, green nuclear power? Absolutely!</A></P><P>Westinghouse was set to be the king of what Toshiba thought would be the golden age of nuclear power. Toshiba’s president and CEO envisioned a market where 10 large nuclear reactors would be built each year until 2020, amounting to 130 gigawatts of new reactor capacity.</P><P>Just 10 years after forecasting billions in profit, Westinghouse’s bankruptcy filing cited as much as $10 billion in debt.</P><P>As part of the new golden age, Westinghouse proposed a new, commercially unproven reactor design — the AP1000. The company touts the reactor as “the safest and most economical nuclear power plant available in the worldwide commercial marketplace.”</P><P>In the U.S., four of these reactors are under construction. But the reality is this: These projects are so far behind and so over-budget that they triggered the bankruptcy of the world’s premier nuclear contractor.</P><P>The four reactors under construction in Georgia and South Carolina were scheduled to be completed by 2019-2020, but are seriously behind schedule. The projects are only between 30 percent to 40 percent compete.</P><P>According to a Morgan Stanley analyses, the owners of the reactors face billions of dollars in cost overruns, and with the bankruptcy, it is very possible the projects may never be completed.</P><P>In South Carolina, the completed project could be as much as $5.2 billion over budget, while Southern Co. in Georgia faces cost overruns that could reach $3.3 billion.</P><P>It is no wonder that Stan Wise, the chairman of Georgia’s state Public Service Commission, said “If I had known any of this a decade ago, we could have gone a different way.”</P><P>It was just last year when the “newest” nuclear reactor in the U.S. went online. It used 1960s technology, took 43 years to complete and cost $6.1 billion. In March of this year, the reactor went down and has yet to be fixed.</P><P>The news of Westinghouse’s death rattle comes at the same time that California’s consideration of the historic proposal to close the state’s last nuclear power plant and replace it with greenhouse gas-free renewable energy.</P><P>The agreement to close the last remaining nuclear power plant in California — Pacific Gas &amp; Electric’s (PG&amp;E) Diablo Canyon – was released in June 2016. The landmark agreement was a product of a proposal by PG&amp;E and Friends of the Earth, with other environmental, labor and community groups.</P><P>As the plant goes offline, the needed power would be replaced with renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy storage resources free of greenhouse gasses (GHG).</P><P>The renewable energy alternatives cost less than continuing to operate the controversial, aging reactors at Diablo Canyon.</P><P>In the agreement, PG&amp;E, which owns and operates the nuclear reactors, unions representing workers at the plant, the local communities, and environmental organizations agreed: “Orderly replacement of Diablo Canyon with GHG-free resources will be the reliable, flexible and cost-effective solution for PG&amp;E customers.”</P><P>“Cost-effective.” Two small words, but a historic end to the perilous age of nuclear power in California.</P><P>The agreement to close Diablo Canyon sets to rest the economic question: operating outdated, aging nuclear power plants is more expensive than procuring cheaper, more efficient and cleaner technologies.</P><P>This is what 21st-century clean energy looks like. It’s cheaper, cleaner, safer and does not produce proliferation-related and terrorism-related risks of nuclear power.</P><P>What happened in California needs to be repeated across the country. The intransigent nature of nuclear power, which must operate full blast, 24 hours a day, is impeding the increased uptake of solar and wind power.</P><P>We have a technical and ethical imperative to massively increase our use of GHG-free energy to combat <mark>climate change</mark>.

The grant will fund further R&amp;D and manufacturing of both developing and proven high-performance materials that enable NET Power’s novel, clean, low-cost power generation technology to reach extremely high efficiencies.</P><P>NET Power, <mark>Toshiba Corpo</mark>ration (TOKYO: 6502), a world-class technology manufacturer, Goodwin Steel Castings (LSE: GDWN), a global expert in metallurgy and castings based in the UK, and The Shaw Group (NYSE: <A title=""SHAW"" href=""http://studio-5.financialcontent.com/prnews?Page=Quote&amp;Ticker=SHAW"" target=""_blank"">SHAW</A>), a leading engineering, procurement and construction firm, will utilize these advanced materials in NET Power’s 25MW natural gas demonstration plant.</P><P>“Through this competition and the CCS Commercialisation Programme, The Department of Energy and <mark>Climate Change</mark> is focused on making CCS more affordable, and they recognize NET Power’s potential as a breakthrough technology,” said NET Power CEO Bill Brown. “Our step-out process leaps over current CCS technologies by producing electricity that generates zero atmospheric emissions and is less expensive than cheap, <mark>carbon</mark>-emitting technologies. We are excited to work with the UK government to commercialize this important technology.”</P><P>NET Power’s new fossil fuel-based power technology is low-cost and highly efficient – on par with state-of-the-art natural gas combined cycle plants. In addition to generating electricity at strongly competitive costs, though, NET Power also eliminates all atmospheric emissions, including <mark>CO2</mark>. To do this, NET Power utilizes a novel, oxyfuel, high-pressure, supercritical <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide thermodynamic cycle—named the Allam Cycle after lead inventor Rodney Allam of Chippenham, England. Mr. Allam was previously the Director of Technology Development at Air Products and Chemicals PLC. He was a lead author for the IPCC report on <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage and received the 2012 Global Energy Prize.</P><P>NET Power is different from typical <mark>carbon</mark> capture technologies, which require the addition of new processes and equipment to current power systems. Rather than use this approach, which results in increased costs and reduced efficiency, NET Power developed a new power generation technology that was designed from the ground up to eliminate air emissions. The resulting system produces low-cost electricity and a pipeline-ready <mark>CO2</mark> byproduct that can be sequestrated or used in enhanced oil recovery without requiring additional expenses and processes.</P><P>“This announcement helps maintain the UK’s place leading the world in CCS, to deliver an affordable and secure low <mark>carbon</mark> energy mix,” said Energy and <mark>Climate Change</mark> Secretary Edward Davey. “<mark>Carbon</mark> Capture and Storage is a huge opportunity for our world class research industry. The UK’s clear commitment to CCS is underlined by innovative companies like NET Power and Toshiba’s choosing British manufacturer Goodwin for its world leading expertise.”</P><P>Under the terms of the grant, Goodwin and Toshiba will further develop and manufacture advanced materials to be used in the turbine that Toshiba is developing for the NET Power process. These materials will lead to improved NET Power cycle performance. The DECC grant will directly create high-value R&amp;D and manufacturing jobs in the UK, and it will solidify Goodwin’s position as a global leader in advanced materials manufacturing. NET Power and Shaw will support overall project engineering and integration of the materials into the NET Power cycle. NET Power’s UK-based subsidiary, NET Power Europe, will administer the grant and conduct other R&amp;D in the UK.</P><P>NET Power’s Allam Cycle is a flexible platform technology that spans natural gas, coal, solar, nuclear, enhanced oil recovery and liquefied natural gas applications, each of which will directly address rising electricity costs while enabling aggressive emissions reduction targets to be met. DECC’s grant supports NET Power to lay the foundation for a coal development program that will result in lower-cost coal-fired power generation that eliminates all atmospheric emissions of <mark>CO2</mark>, SOX, NOX and particulates.</P><P>NET Power, Shaw, Toshiba, and Exelon Corporation (NYSE: <A title=""EXC"" href=""http://studio-5.financialcontent.com/prnews?Page=Quote&amp;Ticker=EXC"" target=""_blank"">EXC</A>), the leading U.S. competitive energy provider, have partnered to develop a 25MW natural gas plant demonstrating NET Power’s technology; the plant is expected to begin operating in late 2014. Construction of the first 250MW NET Power plant is expected to begin in early 2015. In June 2012, Shaw committed up to$50.4 million in cash and in-kind services to the effort, subject to certain milestones, acquiring up to 50% of NET Power LLC as those milestones are completed.</P><P><STRONG>NET Power LLC</STRONG> is a Durham, N.C.-based company affiliated with 8 Rivers Capital LLC, the inventor and early developer of the NET Power technology.

Then, in 2009, when regulators in both Georgia and South Carolina approved the construction of new AP1000 reactors, it looked like Toshiba’s investment would pay off.</P><P>Eight years later, construction on those plants is still under way. But <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/business/westinghouse-toshiba-nuclear-bankruptcy.html?_r=0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">according to The New York Times</A>, “The cost estimates are already running $1 billion to $1.3 billion higher than originally expected, according to a recent report from Morgan Stanley, and could eventually exceed $8 billion over all.”</P><P>Meanwhile, bigger scares have cast doubt over the nuclear sector’s long-term future. The earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in March 2011 touched off a series of meltdowns at the country’s Fukushima Daiichi plant. The incident soured public attitudes toward nuclear power around the world, including in the United States, where officials have since moved toward decommissioning aging plants in <A href=""http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2017/0108/The-shutdown-of-New-York-s-Indian-Point-is-far-from-the-end-of-nuclear-power"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">New York</A>, <A href=""http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/USA-Update/2016/0621/Why-California-plans-to-shut-down-its-only-remaining-nuclear-power-plant"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">California</A>, and <A href=""http://www.exeloncorp.com/newsroom/clinton-and-quad-cities-retirement"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Illinois</A>.</P><P>The AP1000 was <A href=""https://www.iaea.org/NuclearPower/Downloads/Technology/meetings/2011-Jul-4-8-ANRT-WS/2_USA_UK_AP1000_Westinghouse_Pfister.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">billed for its safety</A> in earthquakes and other natural disasters. But at the same time politicians were turning against nuclear power out of safety concerns, a flood of cheap natural gas, wind, and solar power has eaten away at its economic advantages.</P><P>Last December, Duke Energy won a Nuclear Regulatory Commission license to operate two AP1000 reactors at its William States Lee III plant in Gaffney, S.C.. But, in a sign of the industry’s downturn, “The Lee decision is further complicated by several factors: Whether prices for a competing fuel, natural gas, stay low; the impact of environmental regulations such as President Obama’s <mark>carbon</mark>-cutting plan, now on hold; and whether federal regulators will let Duke extend the operating licenses of its current nuclear fleet,” <A href=""http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/business/article122205799.html#storylink=cpy"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">according to The Charlotte Observer</A>.</P><P>Westinghouse has faced other, more specific challenges.

Technologies related to electric vehicles are a typical example of CCMT technologies related to Transport.  Renewable Energy includes technologies in areas such as hydro energy, wind energy, solar energy and geothermal energy.  In Buildings, emission reductions are gained through better lighting, heating, ventilation systems as well as better elevators, escalators and increased thermal performance in general.    Traditional Energy includes improvements in fossil-fuel technologies and alternatives such as nuclear energy.  Clean Energy Enablers are technologies related to energy conversion or management systems that are also designed to reduce greenhouse gases.  Technologies related to batteries are example of technologies that would fall under this category as batteries are considered an alternative to using other types of energies that are more polluting.  Smart Grids are related to the imporvement of technologies related to an electrical supply network using digital communication technology.  Using communication technologies to optimize electricity usage ultimately empowers consumers to more effictiently control energy use thereby reducing the likelihood of outages. <SUP id=""fn13-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn13""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>13</A></SUP> Finally, <mark>Carbon</mark> Capture related technologies are designed to capture waste CO<SUB>2</SUB> and other greenhouse gases and inject it into deep underground rock formations for permanent storage. <SUP id=""fn14-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn14""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>14</A></SUP></P><P>The Canadian researcher data used in this report was obtained from Antoine Dechezleprêtre, Associate Professorial Research Fellow at the Grantham Research Institute on <mark>Climate Change</mark> and the Environment at the London School of Economics, and co-author of the UNEP and EPO report.  The analysis focuses on patent applications filed between January 1st, 2008 and December 31st, 2012.  The dataset consists of 7,873 high-value invention (HVI) patent applications with at least one Canadian researcher filed over the time span translating into 2,184 HVI patent families.  A patent family represents one or more published patents related to the same invention with a shared priority.  This report uses the same fractional counting approach as in the UNEP and EPO report for assigning patented inventions to inventors in cases where multiple inventors from various countries jointly filed a patent.  Using the fractional counting approach, the 2,184 HVI patent families equates to 608 HVI patent families.  This approach uses information on the inventor's country of residence or origin to determine in which country a patented invention has been developed.  For example,  in the case where a patent is filed by a Canadian, an American, and a Japanese inventor, Canada would be assigned one third of the ownership of the patent, the United States would also retain one third of the ownership, and Japan would retain the final third of the ownership.</P><P>In addition to examining CCMT patenting activity by researchers, this report examines the CCMT patent data from the perspective of business inventive activity.  The Derwent <mark>Innovation</mark> database was used to extract patent families that were filed in more than one country and where the basic patent, or the first member of the patent family, was filed between 2008 and 2012.  We refer to these patent families as high-value inventions.  The dataset consists of 99,935 high-value inventions in CCMT.  The Canadian businesses dataset represents approximately 1%, or 1,140 high-value inventions, of the total number of patent families worlwide involved in CCMT.  This is approximately half the size of the Canadian researcher dataset.  Similar to the researcher data, the business data is limited to patent filed between January 1st, 2008 and December 31st, 2012.  An absolute counting approach is used to assess the patented inventions to businesses.  The reason for not using the fractional counting approach for the business analysis is because the IP is associated with the company's country of origin based on its headquarter's location.</P><P>Time was spent treating the data to ensure that proper country codes were attributed to businesses. This is due to cases of missing address information as reported by the office where the basic patent was applied. Treatment included creating a database of business names from the dataset and attributing a country code to those businesses that were without a country code but that have already appeared somewhere in the dataset with one.  In doing so, the percentage of businesses without an address dropped from 5% to less than 1%.</P><H2 id=""toc-5"">Methodology</H2><H3>Patent analytics</H3><P>The development and adoption of new technologies are required to meet current and future environmental challenges. <SUP id=""fn15-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn15""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>15</A></SUP> Patent data is a good starting point for analysis of the development of new technologies as it provides important information on the specific <mark>innovation</mark> in the invention and who the inventors and applicant are.  Like any data source patent data has its strengths and weaknesses and if used in the wrong way it can lead to erroneous conclusions and poor policy.  The following provides context on the use of patents in understanding <mark>innovation</mark>.</P><P>While patents measure the flow of new ideas, it has been argued that patents may not measure <mark>innovation</mark> for three important reasons: patents do not include non-patented <mark>innovation</mark>s, not all patents result in commercialization, and many patents are strategic in nature. <SUP id=""fn16-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn16""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>16</A></SUP> For this reason the analysis is based on patent families that include applications in at least two jurisdictions.  This makes it more likely that these patent families will be a higher-valued invention and that the firm expects to commercialize the invention. <SUP id=""fn17-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn17""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>17</A></SUP></P><P>Another challenge presented is that many <mark>innovation</mark>s or inventions remain hidden as trade secrets.  These <mark>innovation</mark>s will be missed in a measure that includes only patents.  However, a 2008 study indicates that world-first innovators patent more frequently. Conversely, firms that patent infrequently tend to be imitators. <SUP id=""fn18-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn18""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>18</A></SUP> In addition, the study finds that firms that protect their intellectual property are more likely to increase their profits than those that do not.  In addition, SMEs that patent are more likely to be high-growth firms, which is important for success. <SUP id=""fn19-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn19""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>19</A></SUP> These conclusions are reinforced by a Canadian study that noted that firms that are aggressive innovators, introducing radically new products that involve patent protection, have higher profits. <SUP id=""fn20-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn20""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>20</A></SUP> Finally, while some inventions are not patented, patents are obtained for almost all economically significant inventions. <SUP id=""fn21-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn21""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>21</A></SUP></P><P>Below are the primary ways to view or interpret patent data:</P><DL><DT><STRONG>Market Reach</STRONG></DT><DD>Patent filings in foreign markets are a good indicator of firms accessing those markets.  Surveys have shown that firms that hold patents are more likely to be exporters <SUP id=""fn22-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn22""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>22</A></SUP> .</DD><DT><STRONG>Innovative Activity</STRONG></DT><DD>When we do not account for filings in multiple jurisdictions we are double and triple counting the number of patented inventions or innovative activities.  In order to address this patent data allows for the formation of patent families where by each family includes all related or similar patents in all jurisdictions.</DD><DT><STRONG>Scientific Strength</STRONG></DT><DD>It is possible to identify the researchers or scientists, rather than the company or applicant.  While these can be the same, they are often different.  In this way we can see the inventive activity of Canadian researchers working in other countries or for non-Canadian companies.</DD><DT><STRONG>Relative Advantage</STRONG></DT><DD>Canada is a small open-economy.  For this reason it is unlikely that our industries or innovators would have an absolute advantage in a particular area, be the most prolific IP users or have the largest global market share.  However, there are areas where we have a comparative or relative advantage.  Much work has been done in the creation of metrics of relative technological advantage and relative specialization.</DD></DL><H3>Patent families</H3><P>The analysis of businesses and institutions is based on Derwent <mark>Innovation</mark>'s patent family data. These families are defined as drawing together patents covering the same invention and their relationship is defined by the priority or application details claimed by each document.  A patent family can be tagged to multiple classifications.  For this reason, it is important to note that when we say patent, we actually mean a patent linked to the specific classification regardless of if it was tagged to another one.</P><P>Similar to the EPO report, the patent family data in this report was used to construct statistics for &quot;high-value&quot; inventions.  High-value inventions are defined as patent families that are filed in more than one jurisdiction.  Although it can be said that patents are not all of high-value, it is rare to find that a successful invention was not patented.  This idea along with our methodology for using only patent families filed in more than one jurisdiction justifies our assumption that the patents in our datasets are high-value inventions.  Although it is very difficult to quickly identify the value of patents within a large dataset, it is a safe assumption that patents filed in multiple jurisdictions are likely to be of higher value than patents filed in only one jurisdiction.  By omitting patents filed in only one jurisdiction from the dataset, it was possible to limit the dataset to high-value inventions.</P><H3>Revealed technological advantage</H3><P>In order to gain a better understanding of Canada's strengths in CCMT research, we use the Revealed Technological Advantage (RTA) index, which was developed by the OECD and uses patenting intensity to allow for industries to be compared between countries of different sizes on a relative basis.  The index is calculated as a correction for the absolute numbers of HVI patent families in order to account for the fact that some countries file more patent applications than others in all fields of technology.  In this report the RTA index is used to determine where Canadians have a comparative advantage over competitors.  This report compares Canada's RTA index for each CCMT category to that of the G7 countries along with four other countries, China, Korea, Australia and Denmark.  China and Korea are included in the comparison because they are two prolific patenting countries.   Australia is also included because of its IPO's similarities with the Canadian IPO in terms of size and activity levels.  Finally, Denmark is included because of its specialization in the area of CCMT.</P><P>The formula used to calculate the RTA is as follows:</P><DL><DT><STRONG>Numerator</STRONG></DT><DD>The sum of HVI patent families for a category (or subgroup) in Canada divided by the sum of HVI patent families for the category (or subgroup) in the world</DD><DT><STRONG>Denominator</STRONG></DT><DD>The sum of HVI patent families in Canada divided by the sum of HVI patent families in the world

The team is comprised of over 30 specialists who engage across all geographies (with team members in New York, San Francisco, London, Tokyo and Hong Kong), taking a local approach with companies while benefiting from global insights. It is positioned as an investment function and collaborates closely with BlackRock’s more than 125 investment teams to ensure team members have a long-term value mindset, engaging with companies irrespective of whether a holding is in active or <SPAN>index-tracking</SPAN> portfolios, or both. As a significant number of our clients invest through index-based strategies, <SPAN class=""s2"">engagement is an important mechanism to provide feedback or signal concerns about factors affecting long-term performance, absent the option to sell.</SPAN></P><P>Many of our engagements are triggered because companies have not provided sufficient information in their disclosures to fully inform our assessment of the quality of governance, including the exposure to and management of environmental and social factors. We ask companies to review their reporting in light of their investors’ informational needs. In our view, companies that report only to meet the regulatory disclosure requirements are missing a prime opportunity to more comprehensively engage new and existing investors about how effectively a business is led and managed. Where reporting requirements are silent on an emerging issue, we believe it is important for companies and investors to develop disclosure guidelines.</P><P>We seek to engage in a constructive manner. Our aim is to build mutual understanding and ask probing questions, not to tell companies what to do. Where we believe a company’s business or governance practices fall short, we explain our concerns and expectations, and then allow time for a considered response. As a long-term investor, we are willing to be patient with companies when our engagement affirms they are working to address our concerns. However, our patience is not infinite - when we do not see progress despite ongoing engagement, or companies are insufficiently responsive to our efforts to protect the long-term economic interests of our clients, we will not hesitate to exercise our right to vote against management recommendations.</P><P>BlackRock’s paper <A href=""/corporate/literature/whitepaper/viewpoint-exploring-esg-a-practitioners-perspective-june-2016.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Read more about our news on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors."">“Exploring ESG: A Practitioner’s Perspective”</A> provides insight into our views on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors and demonstrate the firm’s focus on the impact they can have on long-term value. Our Chairman and CEO, <A href=""/corporate/about-us/leadership/larry-fink"" title=""Read Larry's bio."">Larry Fink</A>, in his <A href=""/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter"" title=""Learn more in Larry Fink's letter to CEOs this year."">2018 annual letter to CEOs</A> (as in prior year CEO letters) highlighted our view that a company’s ability to manage ESG factors relevant to its business is one signal of the leadership that is essential to <mark>sustainable</mark> growth and thus a company’s long-term prospects.</P><P>Each year there are some engagement themes that we prioritize. Our priority themes for 2018 are a continuation of those identified last year and are set out below. We hope that highlighting our priorities will help company boards and management prepare for engagement with us. Some governance issues are perennial, such as board quality and performance, although the areas of focus may change over time.  These will always be a core component of the Investment Stewardship team’s work. Other priorities are evolving and are informed by regulatory and other market developments.</P><P>We strongly encourage companies to provide a detailed agenda when sending us a request for engagement. In practice, we assess whether to initiate an engagement or accept an invitation to engage with individual companies based on a range of material factors including our thematic priorities, level of concern on specific governance issues, observation of market events, and assessment that engagement will contribute to outcomes that protect and enhance the economic value of our clients’ investments.</P><H2 class=""h2-green"">Governance</H2><P>Board composition, effectiveness, and accountability remain a top priority. In our experience, most governance issues, including how environmental and social factors are managed, stem from board leadership and oversight. We will encourage engagement protocols that foster constructive dialogue including with independent directors in those situations where a director is best placed to explain and justify the company’s approach. We will seek to better understand how boards assess their performance and the skills and expertise needed to take the company through its future (rather than prior) multi-year strategy. In that context, we want to understand the board’s position on director responsibilities and commitments, turnover, succession planning and diversity. More specifically, over the coming year, we will continue to engage companies to better understand their progress on improving gender balance in the boardroom. BlackRock recognizes that diversity has multiple dimensions, including personal factors such as gender, ethnicity, and age; as well as professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry, area of expertise, and geographic location. <A href=""/corporate/literature/publication/blk-commentary-engaging-on-diversity-march2018.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""BlackRock Investment Stewardship’s approach to engagement on diversity"">Diverse boards make better decisions</A>. If there is no progress within a reasonable time frame, we will hold nominating and/or governance committees accountable for an apparent lack of commitment to board effectiveness. Further, we will encourage governance structures that enhance accountability (e.g. proxy access in the U.S.), limit entrenchment (e.g. regular election of directors and board evaluations), and align voting rights and economic interests (i.e. one share, one vote).</P><P>The concept of the “<mark>climate</mark> competent board” has surfaced in recent years. For directors of companies in sectors that are significantly exposed to <mark>climate</mark> risk, BlackRock expects the whole board to have demonstrable fluency in how <mark>climate</mark> risk affects the business and management’s approach to adapting the long-term strategy and mitigating the risk. We have the same expectation of boards wherever a company faces a material, business-specific risk. We would assess this both through corporate disclosures and direct engagement with independent board members, if necessary. Where we have concerns that the board is not dealing with a material risk appropriately, as with any other governance issue, we may signal that concern through our vote, most likely by voting against the re-election of certain directors we deem most responsible for board process and risk oversight.</P><H2 class=""h2-green"">Corporate strategy for the long-term</H2><P>For several years we have asked companies to articulate their strategic frameworks for long-term value creation, to affirm that their boards have reviewed those plans. Investors expect the board to be fully engaged with management on the implementation of the strategy, particularly when it needs to pivot in light of unanticipated developments. This demonstrates to investors that boards are engaged with the strategic direction of the company.</P><P><SPAN>As noted in Larry Fink’s <A href=""/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter"" title=""Read Larry Fink’s 2018 letter."">2018 annual CEO letter</A>, corporate strategy disclosures should clearly explain a company’s purpose, i.e. what it is in business to do. <A href=""/corporate/literature/publication/blk-commentary-engaging-on-strategy-purpose-culture-march2018.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""BlackRock Investment Stewardship’s approach to engagement on strategy, purpose and culture"">Companies that better articulate their purpose</A> are more likely to have engaged employees, loyal customers, and other supportive stakeholders<SUP>i</SUP>.</SPAN></P><P>Companies should succinctly explain the long-term strategic goals management is working towards, the milestones that will demonstrate progress, and any obstacles anticipated or incurred. Each year this explanation should be refreshed and adapted to reflect the changing business environment and how it might affect how a company prioritizes capital allocation, including capital investments, research and development, technological adaptation, employee development, and capital return to shareholders. In this context, we are also interested in understanding how a board addresses shorter-term goals, such as those focused on quarterly performance.</P><H2 class=""h2-green"">Compensation that promoteslong-termism</H2><P>We will be particularly focused on how boards establish performance metrics and hurdles in the context of the aforementioned long-term strategy setting. We expect executive pay policies to use performance measures that are closely linked to the company’s long-term strategy and goals. This should ensure that executives are rewarded for delivering strong and <mark>sustainable</mark> returns over the long-term, as opposed to short-term hikes in share prices. To this end, we’ll seek clarity on the company’s balance and prioritization between “input” metrics that are within management’s control relative to “output” metrics such as earnings per share or total shareholder return. Where pay seems out of line with performance, we expect the company to provide detailed justification in its public disclosures and may engage with independent directors where concerns persist. We may ask the board to explain the extent to which it considers internal pay equity and the broader macroeconomic context when setting pay. We may vote against the election of compensation committee members in instances, including but not limited to, where a company has not persuasively demonstrated the connection between strategy, long-term shareholder value creation and incentive plan <A href=""/corporate/literature/publication/blk-commentary-our-approach-to-executive-compensation-march2018.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""BlackRock Investment Stewardship’s approach to executive compensation"">design</A>.</P><H2 class=""h2-green"">Disclosure of <mark>climate</mark> risks</H2><P>The <A href=""/corporate/insights/blackrock-investment-institute"" title=""Learn more about the BlackRock Investment Institute (BII)."">BlackRock Investment Institute</A> has published two papers – <A href=""/corporate/literature/whitepaper/bii-pricing-<mark>climate</mark>-risk-us.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Read this publication on the impact of <mark>climate change</mark>."">&quot;The Price of <mark>Climate Change</mark> – Global Warming’s Impact on Portfolios”</A> and <A href=""/corporate/literature/whitepaper/bii-<mark>climate</mark>-change-2016-us.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Learn more about adapting your portfolio to <mark>climate change</mark>."">“Adapting Portfolios to <mark>Climate Change</mark>”</A>– on <mark>climate change</mark> as an investment consideration, to which the Investment Stewardship team contributed. That work enhanced our understanding of the complexity companies and investors face in relation to <mark>climate change</mark>. It has also informed our engagement with companies on the anticipated impact of <mark>climate change</mark> on their business models and operations over time. We believe that enhanced, meaningful disclosures are an important step towards building understanding of the impact on individual companies, sectors and investment strategies. Given <mark>climate</mark> risk is a universal issue, we believe disclosure standards should be developed that are applicable to listed companies across each market and, ideally, that are globally consistent.</P><P>To that end, BlackRock continues to be a member of the industry-led Financial Stability Board Task Force on <mark>Climate</mark>-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”). The TCFD published in June 2017 its <A href=""https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/publications/recommendations-report/"" target=""_blank"">recommendations</A> around four thematic areas that represent core elements of how organizations operate – governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. This framework offers companies and investors a starting point to assess, report, and price <mark>climate</mark>-related risks and opportunities. In our view, the TCFD recommendations, which include sector-specific supplemental guidance, provide a relevant roadmap for companies and help achieve comparability and consistency of reporting. Over the course of the coming year, <A href=""/corporate/literature/publication/blk-commentary-engaging-on-<mark>climate</mark>-risk-march2018.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""BlackRock Investment Stewardship’s approach to engagement on <mark>climate</mark> risk"">we will continue to engage companies</A> most exposed to <mark>climate</mark> risk to understand their views on the TCFD recommendations and to encourage them to consider using this reporting framework as evolves over time.</P><H2 class=""h2-green"">Human capital management</H2><P>Most companies BlackRock invests in on behalf of clients make the point in their public disclosures that their success is heavily dependent on their employees or talent. Often they also report that they are operating in a talent constrained environment, or put differently, are in a war for talent. It is therefore important to investors that companies establish themselves as the employer of choice for the workers on whom they depend. A company’s approach to human capital management – employee development, diversity and a commitment to equal employment opportunity, health and safety, labor relations, and supply chain labor standards, amongst other things – will vary across sectors but are a factor in business continuity and success. In light of evolving market trends like shortages of skilled labor, uneven wage growth, and technology that is transforming the labor market, many companies and investors consider having a high standard of human capital management a competitive advantage. In <A href=""/corporate/literature/publication/blk-commentary-engagement-on-human-capital-march2018.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""BlackRock Investment Stewardship’s approach to engagement on human capital"">our engagement on these factors</A>, we seek to ensure companies are adopting the sound business practices likely to create an engaged and stable workforce. As part of the engagement, we are interested to know if and how boards oversee and work with management to improve performance in these areas. Such engagement also provides a lens into the company’s culture, long-term operational risk management practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s oversight.</P><P>A copy of the BlackRock Investment Stewardship team’s 2018 engagement priorities can be found on our website here: <A href=""https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/en-us/about-us/investment-stewardship/engagement-priorities"">https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/en-us/about-us/investment-stewardship/engagement-priorities</A></P><P><SUP>i</SUP> “Culture of Purpose – Building business confidence; driving growth – 2014 core beliefs &amp; culture survey” available at <A href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/about-deloitte/us-leadership-2014-core-beliefs-culture-survey-040414.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Read more about core beliefs culture."">https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/about-deloitte/us-leadership-2014-core-beliefs-culture-survey-040414.pdf</A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""ls-cmp-wrap"" id=""w1506575530509""><DIV class=""iw_component"" id=""c1506575530509""><DIV data-componentname=""Accordion"" data-component-display-name=""Copy of Accordion"" class=""vi16""><DIV class=""accordion arrow-icon tinymce""><DIV class=""introduction""><H2 class=""h2-green"">Reports</H2></DIV><UL class=""accordion-list""><LI class=""accordion-item active""><DIV class=""accordion-data""><P><A href=""/corporate/literature/publication/blk-profile-of-blackrock-investment-stewardship-team-work.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Read more about profile of the Investment Stewardship team's work.""><SPAN class=""icon-pdf "">Profile of Investment Stewardship team's work</SPAN></A></P><P>This brochure sets out the philosophy and approach of the BlackRock Investment Stewardship team in promoting sound business practices aligned with long-term value creation.

									</SPAN></DIV></DIV></PERSONALIZATION-PLACEMENT></DIV><DIV class=""article article-first-row premium""><P>Back in the late 1970s, as a consultant to several Japanese computer giants, I read everything I could about Japanese business. It was all very interesting—interesting, but not particularly useful. When I became a line manager in 1981, I realized how little of what I’d read had any practical value. I couldn’t control interest rates, the education system, or the culture. Wasn’t there something to learn from the Japanese that I could actually apply in my own managerial role?</P><P>Having spent the past ten years working for Japanese companies, I can now answer that question. As an insider, I’ve discovered more than ten specific management techniques the Japanese use to run their businesses. I’ve also come to understand why these techniques are so effective; I’ve seen them change people’s behavior—including my own. And I’ve learned that many, though not all, of these approaches are equally effective in the United States.</P><P>My “research lab” has been Toshiba America, where I was vice president and general manager of its computer division for nine years, and Seiko Instruments USA, where I have been president of U.S. operations since 1989. Toshiba America and Seiko Instruments USA are U.S. companies, have mostly American employees, and compete in the U.S. market, but they have strong cultural and financial ties to Japan.</P><P>I have had close relationships with the Japanese managers assigned to me and with those to whom I reported in Japan. I have seen how they manage their own people, American employees, customers and vendors, and the external marketplace. I’ve heard the president of Toshiba America say, as we discussed some problems with product quality, “This is not Japanese quality.” And I’ve heard Japanese managers say, when talking about problems with an American employee, “We must help this person overcome his weaknesses.”</P><P>From this vantage point, I’ve seen how powerful seemingly simple things like six-month budget cycles, consensus decision making, and <EM>kaizen,</EM> or continuous improvement, can be, especially in combination. While non-Japanese managers are familiar with—and may even practice—some of the typically Japanese management techniques, rarely do they practice them all.</P><P>I want to encourage non-Japanese managers to put aside economic, cultural, and trade issues for the moment and learn from what I’ve seen the Japanese do every day.</P><H2>Welcome to Japanese Management </H2><P>When I was hired in 1981 to help Toshiba capture the U.S. computer market, I was full of ambition and energy. I needed it, since all I had to work with were four Japanese engineers, one American secretary, and two misfit personal computers the U.S. market didn’t want. The two CPM-based, 8-bit CPU personal computers could not run any U.S. software and were hardly elegant machines. (CPM is the operating system for the 8-bit computer.) The trade press, in fact, described the PCs as “rugged tanks.”</P><P>Within a month, IBM made the whole CPM world obsolete with the introduction of the IBM PC DOS machine using 16-bit CPU (central processing unit) technology. We had a difficult product to sell, and problems of culture and credibility made it hard to convince Toshiba’s Japanese engineers to respond. The problems seemed insurmountable. Frankly, I thought Toshiba would fail and abandon the U.S. market. But it didn’t. We overcame the initial business setbacks and over the next three years introduced a better quality dot-matrix printer and went on to build a <SPAN class=""bodysmallcaps"">$</SPAN>75 million printer business against such formidable opponents as Epson, NEC, and Oki. We then reentered the PC market with a laptop computer and gained a leading share in that market. By the time I left Toshiba in 1989, 350 American and two Japanese employees were supporting annual sales of <SPAN class=""bodysmallcaps"">$</SPAN>400 million. 
 </P><P>Perseverance and patient capital helped, but I also attribute Toshiba’s success to the management approaches that allowed the company to learn and stay on track. Let me explain how I came to accept—and even appreciate—these approaches and why I think non-Japanese managers should use them too.</P><H3>Budget for Six Months </H3><P>When I went to work for Toshiba, I immediately had to adjust to a 6-month budgeting cycle. The Japanese fiscal year generally runs from April through March. Although a full-year budget is prepared in January or February, only the first 6 months are approved—the A period. The B part is modified based on the initial results in the A period and is formally approved in August or September.</P><P>Like any U.S. businessperson, I had come in with a 12-month mind-set, so the budgeting periods seemed to come up too fast. I had no sooner developed a budget and countermeasures to correct variances than I was going through it all again. I was giving twice as many performance reviews and awarding bonuses twice as often.</P><P>To me, 6-month budgeting was just twice as much work. But after three or four fiscal periods, I began to appreciate it. I came to welcome the opportunity to change the budget because the world had changed so much in 6 months (remember, this was the PC business!). And having two deadlines each year leaves less room for procrastination. If you’re slipping from the budget after the first quarter and you know you have only 3 months instead of 9 to get back on plan, you work harder to figure out what to do. There’s a greater sense of urgency to hit the target.</P><P>Of course, budgets are also a planning tool. If the budget becomes meaningless during the course of the year, the company is like a ship without a rudder. And if you’re running a company with several divisions, the effect is cumulative. If, say, three divisions are each off by 20<SPAN class=""bodysmallcaps"">%</SPAN>, it’s pretty hard for senior executives to know what to expect. If, on the other hand, the divisions are pretty much on track, management has some control.</P><P>Also, each new budget gave us a chance to wipe the slate clean and start over, which was good for motivation because it allowed managers to adjust goals that no longer seemed achievable. All managers miss their budgets. But if you slip so much that you lose hope of reaching your target, you lose motivation. You know you don’t stand a chance of making it, so you give up.</P><P>When I arrived at Seiko Instruments, its seven divisions were using a 12-month budget cycle. One of the computer peripherals divisions at Seiko Instruments, which was in a particularly volatile industry, was so far off the plan that managers weren’t even referring to the original budget. They had given up on it and were putting up a new set of numbers every month rather than concentrating on developing and implementing countermeasures to minimize the negative variances to budget.</P><P>Since then, all of our divisions have switched to a 6-month budget. This year, the same division was off budget again—but it was off for 3 months instead of 10. Knowing that the end of the fiscal period was just 3 months away, the managers immediately developed countermeasures to minimize the variances to budget. Midyear, they reset the budget and came up with additional countermeasures. If they had still been using a 12-month budget, they would have been directionless again. But by stopping to ask why they were off and then making adjustments, they put a rudder on their ship. The division used to be 30<SPAN class=""bodysmallcaps"">%</SPAN> off budget, but now it’s maybe 10<SPAN class=""bodysmallcaps"">%</SPAN> off—which is something you can get your arms around and fix. 
 </P><P>When I tell my U.S. peers about 6-month budgeting, I get one of two reactions. Either they say we spend too much time planning, or they ask why we don’t use a quarterly plan. A quarter is too short a time to turn the ship. Besides, it would be too time consuming to create the plan, get it approved, communicate it to everyone, and start performing against it every 3 months. Six months is a good compromise. You ensure that the budget is realistic, but you don’t spend all your time on the budget process. Having lived with it for nearly a decade, I think it feels just about right.</P><H3>Fix the Problem, Not the Blame </H3><P>When I say many people miss their business plans, I include myself. From the first month on at Toshiba, I missed the plan. We had a personal computer the market didn’t want; we couldn’t make any changes without getting engineering in Japan to approve and implement them; and management in Japan didn’t fully understand the U.S. market. The budget called for <SPAN class=""bodysmallcaps"">$</SPAN>3 million in sales in the first six months. We shipped approximately <SPAN class=""bodysmallcaps"">$</SPAN>3 million worth of equipment—but we got paid for only about half. Since we were unable to make the engineering upgrades we had promised, the rest came back. The next year the plan called for <SPAN class=""bodysmallcaps"">$</SPAN>10 million. We almost made those numbers, but the product mix—and profit—was not as planned. We made it with printers; the PC sales never really got off the ground.</P><P>I was doing the best I could under the circumstances, but I expected big trouble when I met with the Japanese higher-ups. They represented manufacturing, product development, and the money, and I represented sales and marketing. Everyone was under stress. I was prepared for a knock-down-drag-out fight over who was to blame for our lousy performance.</P><P>Those early meetings were another source of insight into Japanese management. When we got together to talk about why we were underperforming, no one got emotional. The discussions were always calm, and the focus was always on solving the problems. No one seemed the least bit interested in laying blame. Rather than chastising me and putting me on the defensive, they talked to me about what was going wrong and how to fix it.</P><P>I immediately felt that I was part of the team and worked that much harder to get us out of our predicament. I realized that others in the company had a lot of trust in me, and I wanted to live up to it.</P><P>I can’t help but think about what would have happened in a typical U.S. company. When things go wrong, the instinct is to find a scapegoat. I probably would have been fired and replaced. And the problems would still be there for the new person to deal with.</P><H3>Don’t Rest on Your Laurels </H3><P>My managers and I really knocked ourselves out during those early years at Toshiba, with little to show for it. Even though I didn’t get beat up about it, I was under a lot of pressure to make the goals. We started to achieve the budget in the third year, and we continued to make it for something like nine periods in a row.</P><P>I felt great that all the stress and hard work was finally paying off, and I kept waiting for my efforts to be acknowledged. But I never got a thank-you. I got some satisfaction from the business performance itself, but I was frustrated and discouraged that no one back at headquarters seemed to recognize how far we’d come. My staff was discouraged too and complained to me, “We do this great job, but we never get a thank-you. Do the Japanese think we’re their slaves?” 
 </P><P>I finally gave up hope of getting praise. I figured it was just a cultural thing. But little by little, I began to understand what was behind it. The Japanese simply are not interested only in the absolute results; they are equally interested in the process and in how you can do it better next time. I didn’t have a name for this seemingly negative environment back then, but now I see it as part of the process of kaizen, or continuous improvement.</P><P>Kaizen is typically referred to in the context of quality control, but the Japanese apply it broadly. In many areas, they not only <EM>plan</EM> something and <EM>do</EM> it but also stop to <EM>see</EM> the result to determine how it could be done better. American managers, on the other hand, tend to be task-oriented. They create a goal and set out to attain it. Americans interpret the <EM>see</EM> part as a report card—a pat on the back or an admission of mistakes. For the Japanese, it is an opportunity to reflect and learn.</P><P>I have a friend who is responsible for two factories, one in Japan and one in the United States. He explained why the factory in Japan always outperforms the one in the United States: “They both set the same target, and they both may hit it. But when the Japanese hit it, they keep going, whereas the Americans tend to stop and rest on their laurels before pursuing the next goal. So in the end, the Japanese achieve more.” They continuously strive for perfection with the goal of achieving excellence.</P><P>I’m not saying that it’s a good idea to withhold praise. The Japanese style is very frustrating for many non-Japanese, especially those who have little direct contact with the business plan and therefore don’t derive direct satisfaction from achieving the numbers. Even for me, there were times when positive feedback would have boosted my enthusiasm and morale at Toshiba. Most people respond better to constructive criticism when it is balanced with some thanks and compliments. But the constant striving to do better and to learn from your successes and failures is an important step toward superior performance.</P><P>The compulsion to look for ways to improve paid off at Toshiba. One common promotional tool in the PC business is dealer demonstration programs, whereby you offer dealers a free unit for buying a certain number of products. The dealers have to keep the demos in the store for a specified period of time before they sell them. Like most Americans, I started out designing the program, getting the units out, and then going on to the next thing. My Japanese colleagues would always remind me to <EM>see</EM> if the program was working. Improving a million-dollar program, even a little, saves a lot of money.</P><H3>Stay Focused </H3><P>Just as the fascination with deal making permeates U.S. business, the sense of sticking to the knitting characterizes Japanese business. Americans love to make deals. The highly publicized large salaries and jackpot payoffs of the 1980s further encouraged this get-rich-quick deal making. Japanese businesspeople prefer to improve incrementally something they’re already doing—just like Japanese artists. The vast majority of Japanese artists pick a subject or a style and stick with it forever. Yoshiharu Kimura, a wood-block artist, has done nothing but birds for 25 years; another, printmaker Shigeki Kuroda, has for 10 years been depicting only bicycles and umbrellas in every conceivable permutation. By staying focused and by applying the technique of kaizen, these artists consistently improve their work.</P><P>It was the same thing at Toshiba. We questioned how we could improve, but always in the context of what we were already doing. We were never drawn off track, even when attractive opportunities arose. In 1987, I was approached by an entrepreneur with an intriguing plan for a laptop computer with an Apple Macintosh base. He had a solid scheme for solving the legal and technical issues. When I proposed this plan to top management, I received a polite but emphatic no. Toshiba R&amp;D management people in Japan said that their mission was to be king of the PC laptop, meaning the IBM-compatible laptop. And that was that. They didn’t want to dilute Toshiba’s efforts by going into another area. Maybe there were other reasons not to go into the Macintosh area, but we never discussed them. It was understood that the Macintosh distribution channels, software philosophy, and user base were simply too far away from our main business.</P><P>The Japanese not only passed up seemingly attractive options but also pursued seemingly unattractive ones simply because of how they defined the boundaries of the business. For instance, Toshiba got into the floppy disk drive business in 1987 when everyone else was getting out. Toshiba was in the computer business, and floppies were a way to add value to that business. The company entered that market by brute force. Maybe Toshiba is making money on floppies now, but at the time, no venture capitalist “deal maker” would have backed that decision. 
 </P><P>I’ve also seen the stick-to-the-knitting mind-set played out at Seiko Instruments. For the past 50 years, the company has been one of the world’s largest manufacturers of quality watches. A dozen years ago, the company decided to diversify beyond its relatively mature category. But instead of buying other companies or inventing totally new products, either of which it could have done, the company looked inward to its own products—those proprietary technologies and applications it knew best. It commercialized those and now has more than 15 product lines ranging from precision assembly robots to electronic components to scientific test instruments.</P><P>So sticking to the knitting is a way of channeling energy, of putting blinders on, and of defining the realm in which you’re going to play. To Americans, it probably seems boring. They see all these other exciting things going on in the world and know the company has the resources to pursue them. It takes a lot of discipline to ignore them and stay focused. But after a while the discipline becomes automatic. People who have been in a company, a division, or a department for their whole careers understand that they’re there to make the best computers and to sell them on a worldwide basis. It’s just instilled in them.</P><P>You could argue that it’s wrong to be narrow-minded, but I think the more focused approach is better in the long run. It takes the emphasis off making deals and puts it on figuring out how to sell more, bring costs down, gain market share, and add more value for the customer. So Toshiba looks for ways to expand the basic technology its products are based on, like the color liquid-crystal display monitor. It tries to expand geographically or improve the product cycle by offering postsales support, always building on the core business.</P><H3>Quantify Everything </H3><P>Another frustration for an American is the Japanese insistence on quantifying everything, even intangible things. It seemed like an obsession to me at first. During my second year at Toshiba, we started to experience success with the dot-matrix printer business, and we started launching some marketing programs to build our active dealer base by providing them with demo printers. About 18 months into the program, we were seeing some success, and we started to have some money for promotions. We had maybe <SPAN class=""bodysmallcaps"">$</SPAN>300,000 that we wanted to use to get demonstration units out to the dealers. I discussed the program with the Japanese assistant general manager, Shigechika Takeuchi, now president of Apple Computer, Japan. As an aside, I reported to Tokyo, and he reported to me, but he communicated regularly with Tokyo. He was sort of my nag and “shadow.” (For more on shadow managers, see the insert on “Japanese Blindspot: Outsiders.”) </P><ARTICLE-SIDEBAR class=""article-sidebar sidebar--half"" data-sidebar-alternate=""sidebar""><H4 class=""sidebar-title"">Japanese Blindspot: Outsiders </H4><DIV class=""sidebar-contents height--collapse""><P>The Japanese draw sharp distinctions between insiders and outsiders. The concept of insider starts with the family and extends to the school, the company, and the country. The result is a strong “old boy” network in each company that makes it hard for outsiders to be accepted. </P><P>The old boy network gains strength as groups of managers progress through the company together. Every group entering Toshiba is given a class-year designation, and people take it to heart. I’ve heard senior managers at Toshiba referring to other managers within the company as their classmates, even though they entered the class 30 years ago. </P><P>Many Japanese companies will not hire outsiders (people from other companies) for any position higher than an entry-level one, even when it works to the company’s disadvantage. Toshiba went into the laser-printer business after several other manufacturers had already developed and introduced products. But rather than hire top engineers from those other companies, it reinvented the wheel. The product development process moved along so slowly because of the lack of expertise that the company missed an important opportunity. </P><P>The Japanese are also notorious for limiting the advancement of non-Japanese managers. No matter how long a non-Japanese works for a Japanese company, he or she is still considered an outsider. It’s a black-and-white issue with nothing in between. This, of course, deprives the company of the experience and knowledge that an outsider can contribute. </P><P>Some people point to the use of “shadow managers” as a clear indication of the lower status of non-Japanese managers. Shadow managers play the role of informally communicating with Tokyo, often performing <EM>nemawashi,</EM> which literally translates to cutting the roots before you plant the tree. What it really means is informing Tokyo of what is going on and what requests will be made. It is much like a lobbying effort that precedes a formal plan or proposal. I’ve always experienced this role as a positive one. But I’ve heard that other Japanese companies use shadow managers to relay what amounts to orders from Tokyo through the assistant general manager to the general manager and then to the division, effectively depriving the non-Japanese executive of any real decision-making power.</P></DIV></ARTICLE-SIDEBAR><P>I can still picture Mr. Takeuchi sitting in my office where we were planning our first demo program. I vividly remember it because it was so exciting—the first tangible indication of our success. We really had a product that the channel and the end users wanted, and we were able to do something constructive to broaden our distribution. This excitement was dampened, however, by Takeuchi’s obsession with the numbers. He kept asking, “How much are you going to spend? What are you going to accomplish? How much more are you going to sell next month, next quarter, next year as a result?” I was convinced that these things couldn’t be measured. I said, “You can’t tell how much you’re going to sell next year because of this program. That’s ridiculous.” After all, this was marketing. But the more I resisted, the more he insisted that we do it. And soon we were putting numbers on the white board.</P><P>I still believe that the numbers you attach to marketing programs are not an end in themselves; you can’t predict exactly the sales a demo program will generate. And public relations and corporate citizenship programs are even harder to justify in numerical terms. In short, I think the Japanese take “management by the numbers” to the extreme. I guess it’s because they don’t completely trust personal judgment—especially when they’re depending on <EM>gaijin</EM> (outsiders)—and want to avoid personal risk taking. And maybe, too, it’s because numbers are a universal language.</P><P>While I still believe that subjective judgment has its place, I’ve come to appreciate the value of trying to quantify things you know are uncertain. The numbers force you to make estimates and to compare relative alternatives, and they give you something to measure the outcome against. They impose a certain rigor that can help you consider different options. If you’re seeding 700 PC units at about <SPAN class=""bodysmallcaps"">$</SPAN>2,100 each, which is the size and cost of a typical demo program, you want to have some idea of how long those units are going to be used as demos there (dealers have a way of selling them). How many more units will dealers sell because they have the demo there? How many sales will they miss by not having them? It’s amazing how many problems become clearer when you try to break them down into numbers.</P><P>Now I’m the guy at the white board telling others to put it in numbers. It usually takes a lot of arm-twisting, which I’m willing to do. I recall having to push one American field service manager at Seiko Instruments, who was proposing to invest <SPAN class=""bodysmallcaps"">$</SPAN>100,000 and increase staff by 15<SPAN class=""bodysmallcaps"">%</SPAN>, to improve field service. He kept giving qualitative measures of what he wanted to accomplish. I constantly had to ask him to give me quantitative targets. This forced him to refine and justify his thinking and programs. It was a painful process. Although it seems to be second nature for the Japanese, it is something most Americans don’t do naturally. 
 </P><H3>Know the Whole Person </H3><P>Having spent many an evening at <EM>Ginza</EM> restaurants and hostess clubs, like every business visitor to Japan, I was struck by how easily the Japanese can change gears. During the day, they grappled intensely with heavy-duty business problems, but at night they drop the subject completely and socialize. Six o’clock begins a second day, one in which conversations about business are taboo. Once when I started talking about business during a golf lunch, my colleagues reminded me that it was “personal” time.</P><P>Reserving strictly social time forces businesspeople to get to know each other on a different and much more personal level. They get to know each other as whole people. I’ve seen how important that is to business relationships. It builds trust and makes communication much easier.</P><P>I can think of a couple of situations that illustrate the point. When my first manager, Mr. Hirai, learned that the senior manager he worked with in Tokyo was leaving for an assignment in Germany, he was very disappointed. “Mr. Sato and I have worked together for so long that we know how each other thinks,” he explained. “I can anticipate what he’s thinking and feeling.”</P><P>I had the same kind of relationship with Dan Crane, my vice president of computer marketing at Toshiba. He and I shared a lot of experiences in Japan—from drinking beer in Roppongi to climbing Mount Fuji. So we trusted each other and never had to waste energy wondering what the other really meant or worrying about hidden agendas.</P><P>That trust was especially important during the tense time when Toshiba was ready to get back into the U.S. computer business after having de-emphasized it several years earlier. It seemed obvious to me that our division should market the computer; but the Japanese always explore the alternatives, so a task force was formed to analyze it. Dan was on the task force with many Japanese managers from Tokyo, and I wasn’t. I could have found that situation very threatening, but I had confidence in Dan’s judgment. I knew that the decision the task force reached would be rational. As it turns out, the decision was in favor of our division—which proves my point! </P><ARTICLE-SIDEBAR class=""article-sidebar sidebar--half"" data-sidebar-alternate=""sidebar""><H4 class=""sidebar-title"">Japanese Blindspot: Women </H4><DIV class=""sidebar-contents height--collapse""><P>Japanese companies are unwilling to invest in training their female employees. As a result, this highly educated part of the work force is terribly underused. I’ve often seen very competent women who have graduated from the top universities do little more than serve tea. In the 15 years that I’ve been closely involved with Japanese companies, most of the “career moves” I’ve seen women make are to graduate slowly from tea servers to note takers to administrative assistants. </P><P>Management does not consider training and development of female workers a sound investment because it expects the women to leave the workplace at an early age to marry and raise a family, as they have traditionally done. If a woman leaves the work force when she is about 25 years old, it is difficult for her to return. The Japanese culture and infrastructure do not support women who wish to return to work after having children. There are no day-care centers or babysitting services, and such women are looked down on. Of course, there are some highly publicized exceptions where women have taken strong leadership roles in Japan. But attitudes and institutions overwhelmingly work against the effective use of women professionals.</P></DIV></ARTICLE-SIDEBAR><P>I can’t say I’m prepared to go out every night with my American colleagues—and I doubt that they would want to. But when we do get together outside of regular business hours, I try not to work on business problems. We talk about families and sports and other things that help us get to know each other better. It helps us get along during the business day.</P><H3>Get People to Buy into the Decision </H3><P>This issue of getting back into computers after our initial failure demonstrates the Japanese approach to decision making: try to get everyone to agree. This is the Japanese consensus decision making we all hear about. Toshiba wasn’t the only company in deep trouble because its computers couldn’t run Lotus and weren’t IBM compatible. Every Japanese company had made the same mistake, as had Texas Instruments, Digital Equipment Corporation, Wang Laboratories, and Hewlett-Packard.</P><P>At a certain point, it was obvious to us at Toshiba America that we had to be IBM compatible. We had been living and breathing the U.S. market. But we had two other groups to contend with—the Japanese engineers in the Tokyo factory R&amp;D and the Tokyo marketing group. They weren’t sure. So we formed a study team, led by McKinsey, to go through the painstaking process of talking to distributors, dealers, and end users, gathering data, and deciding what we needed. Guess what the task force concluded: we needed to be IBM compatible. 
 </P><P>The purpose of the task force, of course, was to get the others to buy in, which seemed to me a royal waste of time. But I learned that in the end, it wasn’t. When the other groups bought in, they bought in with a vengeance, and their commitment more than made up for the slow decision making. When we finally settled on the idea of “being blue” (IBM’s color), all the players felt they owned the idea. We were all equally determined to be “brighter blue.”</P><P>That’s how we arrived at the idea of a full-featured, IBM-compatible laptop computer. We were the first major company to come out with a successful laptop. We lost more time in the beginning getting everybody focused, but things moved quickly after that.</P><P>With my American managers, I’m somewhat less concerned about reaching 100<SPAN class=""bodysmallcaps"">%</SPAN> consensus agreement. I’ve learned through experience that collaborative decision making works virtually as well as the consensus approach. While consensus requires 100<SPAN class=""bodysmallcaps"">%</SPAN> effort to achieve 100<SPAN class=""bodysmallcaps"">%</SPAN> “buy in,” collaboration requires only 20<SPAN class=""bodysmallcaps"">%</SPAN> effort to achieve 80<SPAN class=""bodysmallcaps"">%</SPAN> buy in. I talk or collaborate with everyone because I’ve seen the importance of owning a decision; I know people want to be heard and not dictated to. But I have limits about how much time I can afford to take. In the United States, the majority rules, so no one seems to expect 100<SPAN class=""bodysmallcaps"">%</SPAN> agreement anyway.</P><H3>Empower the International Sales Group </H3><P>Sorting out the Japanese organizational structure is a challenge—job titles are not equivalent to those in the United States. There are many dotted lines and gray areas of responsibility. Most of my early dealings were with the president of Toshiba America. But soon after, I had a lot of communication with a group of engineers from Japan who seemed to have similar business interests. I wondered who those guys were.</P><P>“Those guys” were part of the international sales and marketing group. The ISM is highly influential and important. In fact, the president of the U.S. subsidiary reports to the general manager of the ISM. And the general manager of the ISM reports almost directly to the president of the whole company, with maybe one person in between.</P><P>The ISM is responsible for global business development outside Japan. In essence, it buys product from the Japanese and resells it to the U.S. and other international subsidiaries at a markup, which covers its salaries and creates a pool for investing in geographic growth elsewhere. When we started, the ISM had money to invest in us. Then after we got going, the ISM took money from us and invested it in Europe and Canada.</P><P>But the significance of the ISM is that it focuses solely on developing business internationally and has the organizational clout to make things happen. It goes out and researches other markets, identifies existing products or product development opportunities, and then goes back to Japan and spearheads the development effort. That’s exactly what happened with the laptop. The ISM was on the task force that decided we wanted to be brighter blue. Then Mr. Hataya, who headed the group, led the laptop product development in Japan. It is interesting to note that although NEC is the compatibility standard in the Japanese market, Toshiba did not develop an NEC-compatible laptop. That goes to show how much power the ISM has.</P><P>Because of the ISM, I basically had two bosses. I reported directly to the president of Toshiba America, who approved the business plan and evaluated the fiscal period business performance. But I also had a dotted line—a very thick, black dotted line—to Mr. Hataya. He was interested in long-term business development in addition to meeting the current fiscal business plan. So each of my bosses had a different perspective. One manager was looking at the day-to-day P&amp;L, and the other was taking a back-road view of product development, spin-offs, and global market development. 
 </P><P>This arrangement gave me the flexibility to subordinate short-term pressures to long-term market development. If I wanted to invest current profits to expand the market instead of making a higher percentage profit, for instance, I could always make my case informally to Mr. Hataya, who could then informally influence the president.</P><P>Although many U.S. companies have international sales and marketing organizations, those organizations don’t have the same power, probably because company leaders have only recently recognized the importance of actively pursuing international markets where stiff competition against the best in all areas of the world ensures that they remain world-class. Typically, world-class companies should have more than a third of sales outside their home market.</P><P>I attribute the ISM’s success to two things: first, the product manager is highly empowered; second, the product manager is a senior manager with more than 25 years of experience in the company, a wide range of experiences, and a broad network of colleagues he knows and trusts.</P><H3>Visit Customers, Build Market Share </H3><P>When I presented my budget, I was always pressed hard to justify head count, for two reasons: first, head count sooner or later leads to higher fixed expenses; and second, the Japanese don’t believe in layoffs, so they would rather be conservative. On the other hand, advertising and travel expenses were easy to justify—advertising because theoretically it yields market share, and travel because it encourages visits to customers. I know that in U.S. companies, you’re always trying to schedule several things when you’re making a long trip. Consequently, the trip inevitably gets postponed. But for the Japanese, having only one meeting is no reason not to go.</P><P>I was amazed at how easily the Japanese would jump on an airplane to visit a customer. I could always get the president of Toshiba America to fly to Texas, even for a one-hour meeting. I do my share of flying too. Recently, I flew from California to Greenville, South Carolina for one two-hour meeting.</P><P>At Seiko Instruments, we have guidelines for how much time we should spend visiting customers, either at their offices or at trade shows, and we tie customer contact to the management bonus plan, even for top managers. General management should spend 20<SPAN class=""bodysmallcaps"">%</SPAN> of its time with customers, for instance, sales management 40<SPAN class=""bodysmallcaps"">%</SPAN>, operations management 30<SPAN class=""bodysmallcaps"">%</SPAN>, field service management 20<SPAN class=""bodysmallcaps"">%</SPAN>, marketing 25<SPAN class=""bodysmallcaps"">%</SPAN>, and engineering 5<SPAN class=""bodysmallcaps"">%</SPAN>. This is one way to reinforce the idea that customers matter.</P><P>Market share also matters. The conventional wisdom is that market share is good because you sell more, and therefore you can make big capital investments in the manufacturing process. That’s true, of course. But there’s also a less obvious advantage. Market share gives you visibility, so more people will hear about the product through word of mouth. Many people buy a technical product because they have confidence in it—it was recommended by a friend, or they saw someone else using it. And existing customers are already sold on your brand, your quality, and your service, so it’s relatively easy to sell them an add-on or upgrade.</P><P>Some U.S. companies have de-emphasized market share, and they’ve lost visibility. After a while, they’re no longer a force in the market. One New England photographic company comes quickly to mind, but there are lots of other examples. 
 </P><P>The Japanese don’t like businesses that aren’t profitable, so when they talk about investing in market share, they’re not talking about negative P&amp;L. They want the business to make a “healthy” profit, which means enough money so you can still break even if you have a setback. But it’s okay to make a few percentage points less and spend money on promotions and other things that will build market share—things that look like an expense but translate into an investment.</P><P>I had a good technique for making this case. I would prepare a 6-month budget with “normal” operational P&amp;L. In addition, I would show projected sales for the 18 months beyond that budget. Then I would prepare a second “investment” budget with lower P&amp;L results. Along with it, I showed the 18-month follow-on sales, which were enough to justify the lower P&amp;L that I was attempting to sell.</P><P>Granted, U.S. companies have to produce quarterly profits to bolster the stock price, but I think it’s a matter of pitching it to investors the right way.</P><H3>Demand Active, Informed Directors </H3><P>Japanese companies have an important operational resource U.S. companies generally do not: the board of directors, which consists of 15 to 20 of the company’s top operating managers and a few outsiders who are closely associated with the company. Managers become eligible for the board in their early fifties and have a few opportunities to be elected. The grapevine is always abuzz with conjecture about who will or will not make it.</P><P>Those who do make it sit on the board for a few years and then retire. The constant turnover of members ensures that the board doesn’t get stale. The fact that the members are drawn from the ranks of people who have many years of experience ensures that they are committed and knowledgeable.</P><P>So when Japanese boards get deeply involved in strategic and operating decisions—as we all do—they have a lot to contribute. Board members are really an extension of top divisional line management, and the constituency of the board is really the employees. Therefore, the point of view is on operations and building value in the core business rather than financial or legal maneuvering and deal making.</P><P>I can appreciate that outside directors bring an important perspective to U.S. boards, but outsiders have neither enough time nor financial incentive to understand the company deeply. And because the CEO usually appoints them, they tend to be reluctant to stand up to management. It’s the company’s loss.</P><P>Let me repeat the disclaimer that the approaches I’ve described here are not unique to Japan. In fact, my observations are consistent with the new wave of management thinking in the United States. And let me reiterate that I don’t think non-Japanese managers should do everything that Japanese managers do. For instance, I don’t recommend 100<SPAN class=""bodysmallcaps"">%</SPAN> consensus decision making, especially in crisis situations, nor do I think managers should neglect to thank people for a job well done. 
 </P><P>My message is simple: the way to make great leaps is to take many small steps, consistently, every day.</P><DIV class=""mvm description-text hbrgray, line-height-tight"">A version of this article appeared in the <A href=""/archive-toc/3906"">November–December 1990</A> issue of <EM>Harvard Business Review</EM>.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""authors mvl"" js-target=""authors-section""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""content-area--article column""><DIV class=""is-inline-block width-100pct""><P class=""mbn description-text ""><SPAN class=""bodybold"">John E.

    I am Sadayuki Sakakibara, Chairman of the Japan Business Federation (Nippon Keidanren), inaugurated as Chairman of the Japanese Business Alliance for Smart Energy Worldwide (JASE-World) in June
    2014.
</P><P>
     
</P><P>
      JASE-World is an organization founded in October 2008 to establish a framework to promote outstanding Japanese smart energy businesses all over the world by business community and
    government in conjunction with each other. We are vigorously engaging in various activities in order to contribute to solving global-scale issues such as <mark>climate change</mark>, energy security and so
    on. 
</P><P>
     
</P><P>
      In the remarkable economic growth of developing countries and world’s expanding energy consumption in recent years, many countries are implementing various measures regarding enhancement
    of energy security and efficient use of energy as important policy challenges. In this situation, smart energy technologies of our country attract strong attentions from various countries around
    the world, and the importance of JASE-World’s activities is becoming more and more increasing. Since its establishment, JASE-World has been actively engaging in dissemination of information to
    the world as well as research and analysis of the possibility of promotion of Japanese smart energy technologies in overseas.
</P><P>
     
</P><P>
     Following the celebration of the 11th anniversary of JASE-World in October this year, we will more actively engage in activities, as a promoter of global development of smart energy
    businesses, to strengthen the public-private cooperation by mobilizing all ability of industries in Japan. With the global development of world-class Japanese smart energy technology, we will
    contribute to solving global-scale issues and lead vitalization of industries in our country.

Service</A><TIME>May. 24, 2017 , 9:00 AM</TIME></P></HEADER><P>Between the energy hub of Houston, Texas, and the Gulf Coast lies a sprawling petropolis: a sea of refineries and oil storage tanks, power lines, and smokestacks, all dedicated to converting fossil fuels into dollars. They are the reason why the Houston area emits more <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>) than anyplace else in the United States.</P><P>But here, on the eastern edge of that CO<SUB>2</SUB> hot spot, a new fossil fuel power plant showcases a potential remedy for Houston's outsized greenhouse gas footprint. The facility looks suspiciously like its forebears, a complex the size of two U.S. football fields, chock-a-block with snaking pipes and pumps. It has a turbine and a combustor. But there is one thing it doesn't need: smokestacks.</P><P>Zero-emission fossil fuel power sounds like an oxymoron. But when that 25-megawatt demonstration plant is fired up later this year, it will burn natural gas in pure oxygen. The result: a stream of nearly pure CO<SUB>2</SUB>, which can be piped away and stored underground or blasted into depleted oil reservoirs to free more oil, a process called enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Either way, the CO<SUB>2</SUB> will be sequestered from the atmosphere and the <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P>That has long been the hope for <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage (CCS), a strategy that <mark>climate</mark> experts say will be necessary if the world is to make any headway in limiting <mark>climate change</mark>. But CCS systems bolted to conventional fossil fuel plants have struggled to take off because CO<SUB>2</SUB> makes up only a small fraction of their exhaust. Capturing it saps up to 30% of a power plant's energy and drives up the cost of electricity.</P><P>In contrast, NET Power, the startup backing the new plant, says it expects to produce emission-free power at about $0.06 per kilowatt-hour. That's about the same cost as power from a state-of-the-art natural gas-fired plant—and cheaper than most renewable energy. The key to its efficiency is a new thermodynamic cycle that swaps CO<SUB>2</SUB> for the steam that drives turbines in conventional plants. Invented by an unlikely trio—a retired British engineer and a pair of technology geeks who had tired of their day jobs—the scheme may soon get a bigger test. If the prototype lives up to hopes, NET Power says, it will forge ahead with a full-scale, 300-megawatt power plant—enough to power more than 200,000 homes—which could open in 2021 at a cost of about $300 million. Both the company and CCS experts hope that the technology will then proliferate. &quot;This is a game-changer if they achieve 100% of their goals,&quot; says John Thompson, a <mark>carbon</mark> capture expert at the Clean Air Task Force, an environmental nonprofit with an office in <mark>Carbon</mark>dale, Illinois.</P><DIV class=""entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-image align-right""><FIGURE class=""figure""><FIGCAPTION><DIV class=""caption""><DIV class=""caption__text""><P>Engineer Rodney Allam conceived the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide cycle at the heart of the new power plant.</P></DIV><SPAN class=""credit"">

A decade ago, as a dealmaking lawyer in New York City, he crafted financial trading strategies for Morgan Stanley. But he was restless. So he called Miles Palmer, a buddy from his undergraduate days at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge. Palmer was a chemist for Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), a defense contractor that designed everything from rail guns to drones. Brown suggested they &quot;make something good for a change.&quot; In 2008, as the economy was collapsing, they left their jobs and started 8 Rivers, a technology incubator in Durham, North Carolina, where Brown also taught law at Duke University.</P><P>They needed something to incubate. They liked the thought of doing something in the energy sector, a famously risk-averse arena, but one in which a breakthrough technology can make a fortune. First came a brief, fruitless attempt to make biofuels from algae. Then, in 2009, the Obama administration's stimulus package offered billions of dollars in grants for &quot;clean coal&quot; projects—ways to reduce coal's CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions. Palmer knew that, worldwide, coal wasn't going away anytime soon, and he understood how it threatened the <mark>climate</mark>. &quot;I wanted to solve that problem,&quot; he says.</P><P>Cleaning up coal has been tough. Not only does coal release twice as much <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> as natural gas, but that CO<SUB>2</SUB> also makes up just 14% of the flue gas from a conventional power plant. Still, coal is plentiful and cheap, and until recently few people cared about the CO<SUB>2</SUB> it unleashes. So coal-fired power plants haven't changed much since 1882, when Thomas Edison's company built the first one in London. Most still burn coal to boil water. The steam drives a turbine to generate electricity. At the turbine's back end, cooling towers condense the steam into water, lest the high-pressure steam there drive the turbine in reverse. Those towers vent much of the energy used to boil the water in the first place. Overall, just 38% of coal's energy yields electricity. &quot;All that energy is just wasted,&quot; Brown says.</P><P>That inefficiency helped drive utilities to natural gas. Not only is gas cleaner—and, in the United States, cheaper than coal—but because it is a gas to begin with, engineers can take advantage of an explosive expansion as it burns to drive a gas turbine. The heat of the turbine exhaust then boils water to make steam that drives additional turbines. The best natural gas &quot;combined cycle&quot; plants achieve nearly 60% efficiency.</P><P>Still, Palmer was focused on coal, the bigger <mark>climate</mark> problem. He built on work he had done at SAIC on a high-pressure combustor for burning coal in pure oxygen. It was more efficient and smaller, and so it would cost less to build. It also produced an exhaust of concentrated CO<SUB>2</SUB>, thus avoiding the separation costs. &quot;I got it to work almost as well as a conventional coal plant, but with zero emissions,&quot; Palmer says. &quot;But it wasn't good enough.&quot;</P><P>Palmer and Brown needed to nudge the efficiency higher. In 2009, they contacted Rodney Allam, a chemical engineer who had run European R&amp;D operations for Air Products, an industrial giant in the United Kingdom. Later, in 2012, Allam won a share of the $600,000 Global Energy Prize, sponsored by the Russian energy industry, for his work on industrial gas production. But at the time, he was mostly retired, concentrating on his fishing, lawn bowling, and gardening.</P><P>Palmer and Brown hired Allam as a consultant. Inspired by some Russian research from the 1930s, Allam thought he saw a way to radically reinvent the staid steam cycle. Forget about boilers, he thought. He would drive everything with the CO<SUB>2</SUB> itself, making an ally out of his enemy. &quot;The only way you could proceed was to develop a totally new power system,&quot; Allam says.</P><P>Allam envisioned the CO<SUB>2</SUB> circulating in a loop, cycling between a gas and what's called a supercritical fluid. At high pressure and temperature, supercritical CO<SUB>2</SUB> expands to fill a container like a gas but flows like a liquid.</P><P>For decades, engineers have worked on Brayton cycles—thermodynamic loops that take advantage of the properties of supercritical fluids, which could be air or CO<SUB>2</SUB>. Supercritical fluids offer advantages: Because they are fluids, a pump can pressurize them, which takes far less energy than a compressor needs to pressurize a gas. And because of the fluidlike gas's extra density, it can efficiently gain or shed heat at heat exchangers.</P><P>In Allam's particular Brayton cycle, CO<SUB>2</SUB> is compressed to 300 times atmospheric pressure—equivalent to a depth of 3 kilometers in the ocean. Then fuel is burned to heat the CO<SUB>2</SUB> to 1150°C, which turns it supercritical. After the CO<SUB>2</SUB> drives a turbine, the gas's pressure drops and it turns into a normal gas again. The CO<SUB>2</SUB> is then repressurized and returned to the front end of the loop. A tiny amount of excess CO<SUB>2</SUB>—exactly as much as burning the fuel created—is shunted into a pipeline for disposal.</P><P>The Allam cycle, as it is now called, comes with costs. Giant cryogenic refrigerators must chill air—which is mostly nitrogen—to extract the pure oxygen needed for combustion. Compressing CO<SUB>2</SUB> into a supercritical state also sucks up energy. But both steps are well-known industrial processes. Allam calculated that discarding the steam cycle would boost the 38% efficiency of a coal plant to 56%. That would put it within striking distance of the efficiency of a contemporary combined cycle plant. As a bonus, the exhaust is nearly pure CO<SUB>2</SUB> that can be sold for EOR. Another perk is that the Allam cycle generates water as a byproduct of combustion, instead of consuming it voraciously as conventional steam cycles do, which could make plants easier to site in arid parts of the world.</P><P>At this point, Brown and Palmer were still planning to use coal as their fuel. But when they sent Allam's handiwork to the engineering firm Babcock &amp; Wilcox, to see whether the system would work on an industrial scale, &quot;they had good news and bad news,&quot; Brown says. On the downside, the Allam cycle would be tough to pull off with coal, at least initially, because the coal would first have to be converted to a synthetic gas, which adds cost. Also, sulfur and mercury in that syngas would have to be filtered out of the exhaust. But on the upside, the engineers saw no reason why the technique wouldn't work with natural gas, which is ready to burn and doesn't have the extra contaminants.</P><P>Brown and Palmer gave up on winning a clean coal grant from the government. Instead, they sought private investment for a far bigger prize: revolutionizing energy production with <mark>carbon</mark> capture. By 2014, 8 Rivers had secured $140 million in funding from Exelon and Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron, two industrial giants that now co-own the NET Power demo plant. In March 2016, the company broke ground on its pilot plant outside Houston.</P><P>&quot;This is the biggest thing in <mark>carbon</mark> capture,&quot; says Howard Herzog, a chemical engineer and <mark>carbon</mark> capture expert at MIT. &quot;It's very sound on paper. We'll see soon if it works in reality. There are only a million things that can go wrong.&quot;</P><DIV id=""paragraph-bundle-3804"" class=""entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-markup""><FIGURE class=""graphic entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-figure""><SVG version=""1.1"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" xmlns:XLINK=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" x=""0px"" y=""0px"" viewbox=""0 0 700 970"" style=""enable-background:new 0 0 700 970;"" xml:space=""preserve""><G id=""text_final""><TEXT transform=""matrix(1 0 0 1 3.9324 33.8154)"" class=""st46 st47"">Smoke out</TEXT><TEXT transform=""matrix(1 0 0 1 3.9324 51.8154)"" class=""st48 st49"">A new power plant will use <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (CO</TEXT><TEXT transform=""matrix(0.583 0 0 0.583 271.7083 56.8105)"" class=""st48 st49"">2</TEXT><TEXT transform=""matrix(1 0 0 1 3.9324 69.8154)"" class=""st48 st49"">steam.

Japanese banks had financed their asset purchases using them as collateral. Many banks failed due to a combination of the collapse of asset values and their clients’ inability to pay back loans.</P><P>Japanese manufacturers lost their traditional source of financing — bank loans. Shrunken product demand and persistent excess capacity caused deflation, which became endemic in Japan. Japan’s traditional bank-centred corporate governance system was blamed for the nation’s economic bust.</P><P>Noting the generally robust performance of the economies of the US, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the UK, the Japanese government decided to adopt a US (or, more broadly, Anglo-American) style corporate governance system over the last decade or so. A range of corporate governance reforms were instituted, aiming to facilitate market based transactions, competition, individual shareholder rights, as well as transparency and information disclosure. Japan’s economic regulatory institutions were also reformed. New laws were introduced and existing laws revised, including company law, the commercial code, the anti-monopoly law, and the financial instruments and exchange act.</P><P>So, how have Japanese corporations reacted to new US-style practices and regulations?</P><P>The reforms transplanted into Japan a Western legal framework and institutions. The new Japanese corporate governance system allows firms to operate similarly to those in the US. A corporation can use a US-style board system with committees consisting of majority outside directors. These outside directors oversee firm performance in management and governance. The market for corporate control now also operates largely as in the West. A hostile takeover of a firm is generally possible. Firms must also disclose consolidated financial statements.</P><P>But have the issues that motivated the reforms been solved in the decade since they were adopted? Has the market for corporate control achieved competitive market principles, transparency and information disclosure? And was the share value maximization principle fully adopted by Japanese managers? The answer to these questions are mostly no. This was largely predictable given Japan’s historical reaction to the transplantation of Western institutions over the long sweep of history since the Meiji Restoration in 1868.</P><P>Since Japan opened up to the West in the early 19th century, there have been repeated attempts to import Western political and economic institutions, laws, technologies and even cultural practices. But rather than being adopted in their original forms, Western practices have been selectively adapted to suit Japan’s needs, tastes and preferences with varied success.</P><P>This is also true of the reforms adopted in the wake of the 1990 financial crisis. Even though all relevant US laws were essentially transplanted in Japan’s corporate governance reform, modifications were made that have had important consequences for the outcomes of reform.</P><P>The interactions between existing Japanese business norms (such as consensus decision making and <EM>keiretsu</EM> business groups) and US corporate governance practices have resulted in several key areas where little change or economic efficiency gains have been achieved. The Japanese market for corporate control still does not operate competitively. There are many more friendly mergers, which typically occur between <EM>keiretsu</EM> and other related firms, than mergers based on hostile takeovers. Most hostile takeovers of poorly functioning firms or takeover attempts have failed.</P><P>Independent, outside directors have been put in place, but they do not seem to function as they do in the US. And, transparency and information disclosure have proven difficult to implement in many established Japanese firms. The continuing prevalence of Japan’s <EM>‘dango’</EM> practice (rigged bidding), for example, clearly violates the reforms’ transparency and information disclosure as well as fair competition objectives.</P><P>There have been successes in corporate governance reforms. The recent revelation that, for the last few years, <mark>Toshiba Corpo</mark>ration inflated reported profits by using improper accounting methods (like underestimating costs) is a case in point. The scandal became public because one of Toshiba’s employees reported their employer’s illegal accounting practice to Japan’s Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission. The employee was able to report the illegal activity using the Whistleblower Protection Act of 2004, which was introduced as part of the reforms.</P><P>But the fact that the problem was continuing even though Toshiba had already implemented a US-style executive committee board system is an example of reform failure. Clearly their outside directors did not function as expected. And neither did the accounting firm that audited Toshiba.</P><P>The problems that motivated the Japanese reforms are far from being solved. Foreign firms will still need to beware of <A href=""http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2008/07/17/fdi-and-corporate-governance-in-japan/"" target=""_blank"">the implications of this in doing business in Japan</A>.</P><P>Corporate governance reforms to implement US-style practices are ongoing in other countries in East Asia, such as China and <A href=""http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2011/07/08/corporate-governance-reform-in-korea/"" target=""_blank"">South Korea</A>. Large pyramidal business groups in both countries (that is, state-owned enterprise groups and <EM>chaebols</EM>) present serious challenges to those reform efforts too.
