In the presentation, Kusugak asserted that people who come to Nunavut from southern regions of Canada (defined as south of the 60th parallel) to work in the mining industry need to have a better understanding of Inuit and the <A href=""http://nlca.tunngavik.com/?lang=en"">Nunavut Land Claims Agreement</A> (NLCA). Further, Kusugak went on to state, “Inuit will not just agree to have land ‘exploited’ or ‘used’ for development…Inuit aren’t going to just give you that land” (Dawson 2013, 1). </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">This article ruptured ideas held in southern imaginaries of Nunavut as mining’s last frontier (Klein 2012), or as a former minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development[</SPAN><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">1]</SPAN><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> called it, “our frozen treasure chest” (Saunders 2014, 1). Instead, Kusugak’s words served as a firm reminder that Nunavut is the homeland of Inuit whose claims to territory have shaped the social and geographical landscapes. He cautioned that mining executives and workers need to learn “what it’s like to work in the North…People need to understand what they’re getting into” (Dawson 2013, 1). </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">I would argue this article also served another purpose: By drawing attention to the complex grounded encounters occurring between mining companies and Northern communities, it interrupted what many people expect of Northern peoples, places, and processes. Mining projects in the Canadian North are often conceptualized in theoretical and practical scholarship as impacting vulnerable Northern populations and challenging traditional ways of life (Hall 2013). This approach fails to understand that Inuit are not merely victims in the face of ‘modern’ development projects (cf. Horowitz 2002), but </SPAN><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">actors</SPAN></I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> in processes of environmental and social change, albeit in highly asymmetrical relations of power (Blaser et al. 2004). Further, less attention is given to the movement of people, capital, and goods in and out of the region (Cameron 2012).</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">In this paper, I draw on interview vignettes to argue that contemporary encounters with mining economies in Rankin Inlet both interrupt and are interrupted by local and trans-local ways of living. Interviews were conducted as part of my Master’s research project (2011-3), which explored the social and environmental legacies of historic mining in Rankin Inlet, Nunavut, and the community’s relationship with current and projected mineral developments in the region. Working closely with a community research assistant in Rankin Inlet in the summer of 2012, I used participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and landscape analysis to engage with government officials, community members, and past and present miners on questions about historical and contemporary mining in the region. Qualitative data used in this article consists of 21 research interviews, as well as field notes and observations. Seven interviewees were government officials (both Inuit and Qallunaat[2]</SPAN><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">) working for the Kivalliq Inuit Association (KIA), Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. (NTI), the Government of Nunavut (GN), and the Hamlet of Rankin Inlet, most of them long-term community residents. Twelve were community members: five Qallunaat and seven Inuit. Two were former NRNM miners, both interviews being simultaneously translated into Inuktitut. One interviewee was a present-day miner. All of the miners interviewed were Inuit.</SPAN></P><P><B>A mine in the backyard</B></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Industrial mining has become the greatest economic driver in Nunavut (Klein 2012). Contemporary mining projects in Nunavut are considered ‘mega-projects’—complex social and political networks that stimulate a range of relationships between government bodies, local communities, and private investors (Priemus et al. 2008). Mining mega-projects must overcome great geographical, financial, and logistical challenges to operate in the Canadian North, and have been described as “projects of technological complexity that are innovative and often experimental” (Browne et al. 2009, 4). </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">The expansion of mineral development presents opportunities and challenges for the region’s Inuit population. While historically, Inuit participated as employees in mining operations, such as the North Rankin Nickel Mine near Rankin Inlet (Cater and Keeling 2014; Williamson 1974) and the Nanisivik mine located near Arctic Bay, Nunavut (Lim, 2013; Midgley, 2012), Inuit were predominantly on the outside of land-use agreements, and were often reactive in managing the social and economic risks associated with mining.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">In 1993, the signing of the NLCA gave Inuit title to 356,000 square kilometres of land, ensuring that claim beneficiaries benefit from mining projects on Inuit Owned Lands and that they are compensated financially through Inuit Impact and Benefit Agreements (IIBAs) for the negative impacts mines have on their communities, land, and ways of life (Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. 2001). As minerals are extracted from the ground in Northern spaces and exploited in global markets, local communities have become a site of negotiation and contestation around mining projects. Mining projects are both core business investments and strategic development investments for communities affected by their operations. In addition to securing regulatory approvals, mining projects seek their ‘social license to operate,’ or community acceptance of the project, by addressing regional and community development concerns (Kemp 2010).</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mineral development has a strong history and ongoing presence in the Kivalliq region. Hardly a new phenomenon, the <A href=""http://www.rankininlet.net/rankin_history.html"">creation of Rankin Inlet</A>—the community where I have been conducting graduate research since 2012—was directly tied to the development of the North Rankin Nickel Mine (NRNM) in the 1950s (Cater 2013). While most of the other communities in what is presently Nunavut were built around cultural or historic attachment to the area, Rankin Inlet was brought into being by mineral development, bringing Inuit families from other settlements or areas around Nunavut, to work on the mine site (Eber 1989). </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">The NRNM contained one of the richest nickel deposits in Canada, and was the first mining town to be established in the Canadian Arctic (Boulter 2011). Inuit families migrated to Rankin Inlet, moving from a semi-nomadic subsistence way of life to an industry-based settlement lifestyle, and entering into the wage-based economy (Damas 2002). From 1957-1962, 70 per cent of the NRNM’s workforce was composed of Inuit working in both above and below ground industrial positions. After the mine’s closure in 1962, most Inuit people stayed, while most Qallunaat left, and this short encounter with mining holds an ongoing presence within the community (Cater and Keeling 2014).</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Today, Rankin Inlet is set to become a centre of mining activity again, as Toronto-based company <mark>Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd.</mark> develops the <A href=""http://www.agnicoeagle.com/en/Exploration/Advanced-Projects/Meliadine/Pages/default.aspx"">Meliadine gold project</A>, located 27 kilometres outside of the community (Klein 2012). The project will use both open pit and underground extraction methods, operating on land mostly covered by glacial overburden and surrounded by deep-seated permafrost. This large-scale industrial mining development is currently in the exploration and feasibility phases, and is expected to start full operation in 2017, corresponding with the closure of Agnico-Eagle’s Meadowbank mine near Baker Lake (Figure 1). The Meliadine project is expected to operate for approximately 10 to 13 years, with three million ounces of proven gold reserves. The project will draw on existing infrastructure found in the Rankin Inlet community, such as using the sealift by barge via Hudson’s Bay, and transporting fly-in/fly-out workers from southern regions of Canada and other communities within the Kivalliq region through the Rankin Inlet airport. The Meliadine project will be linked to Rankin Inlet via a newly constructed all-weather road.</SPAN></P><P> </P><DIV id=""attachment_3328"" style=""width: 5110px"" class=""wp-caption alignnone""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Figure 1.

I had asked her about Agnico-Eagle’s presence within the community and the development of the Meliadine gold project. She mused, “[I]n my life and in my path that I make in this town, I hardly even see them [southern mine workers], and I work at the airport, and they come by, and I don’t talk to them very often…Mostly they act like tourists.” I questioned her further by asking, “So would you like them to come in [to Rankin Inlet] less as southern workers as tourists, but provide more information about what they plan on doing [at the mine site] as well?” She said, “They should acknowledge the gap.”</SPAN></P><P>Mary Louise Pratt defines a contact zone as “the space of colonial encounters, the space in which peoples geographically and historically separated come into contact with each other and establish ongoing relations, usually involving conditions of coercion, radical inequality, and intractable conflict” (1992, 6). These encounters are assembled through “copresence, interaction, interlocking understandings and practices, often within asymmetrical relations of power” (Ibid). It is through these interactions that people who are geographically and historically separated come together and attempt to grapple with their differences. My research informant was expressing dissatisfaction with the ways southern mine workers were moving through the community and representing their presence. To her, acting like a tourist—which is often defined as travelling to a place for pleasure, and not engaging with local peoples and places—shut down opportunities for cross-cultural dialogue and sidetracked the need for accountability from southern workers in representing their company and its actions within the community. She argued, “They are tourists for sure. But when I went to Baker [Lake], I was a tourist, and yet I represented myself as [an employee of] Nunavut tourism [the company I work for]. That’s the difference.”</P><P>This notion of acknowledging the gap between southern mine workers and Rankin Inlet residents around the development of the Meliadine gold project was also raised in an interview I conducted with a territorial government official and long-term Qallunaat resident of Rankin Inlet. He told me that there has been tension between community organizations and Agnico-Eagle due to concerns over disruptions to wildlife and a failure to follow protocols outlined in the NLCA. Caribou migrations occur seasonally with thousands of caribou travelling through <A href=""http://nunavuttourism.com/parks-special-places/territorial-parks/iqalugaarjuup-nunanga"">Iqalugaarjuup Territorial Park</A> near the Meliadine exploration site and Rankin Inlet (Figure 2). Caribou continue to be an important part of Inuit culture, providing food, materials for clothing, and other tools. In calving and post-calving feeding grounds, a total halt to mining operations is required within the NLCA and other IIBAs and protocols for mining companies. In areas through which other caribou are migrating, the pace of development must slow to reduce impact. This includes not using low flying helicopters that may impact the caribou migration.</P><DIV id=""attachment_3329"" style=""width: 4010px"" class=""wp-caption alignnone""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Figure 2: Seasonal caribou migration through Iqalugaarjuup Territorial Park, 2012. Photo credit: Tara Cater.</P></DIV><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Speaking to me about an incident where Agnico-Eagle used low-flying helicopters during the caribou migration, the territorial government official sighed, “And it shouldn’t be a surprise. If the caribou are migrating through, the standard response is to slow down or stop operations that would potentially have an impact on those migrating animals…so to have the opposite happen…you sort of think, so what’s going on, when it shouldn’t be a surprise.” </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">He went on to argue, “There is going to be a lot of pressure to keep production levels going, because [Agnico-Eagle’s] whole business model is based on providing the product on a continual supply.” He paused. “There seems to be no…receptiveness to ‘Oh, we need to slow down when the caribou comes through.’ So that idea that all of a sudden we [Agnico-Eagle] take a few days off…when your production or your labour force is costing you hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars a day…[but] they have no choice, they can’t keep going [due to processes outlined in the NCLA and IIBAs]…and I can see the company’s perspective too.” </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">He concluded the interview, “Is this [Agnico-Eagle’s] home, or just a mine camp?…If the migration changes and [caribou] are no longer coming to the same area and food security is a big topic as well…just lifestyle, if you have to change then you [can’t] find where your roots are…Those are the impacts.”</SPAN></P><P><B>Interruptions/Interrupted</B></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many long-term residents in Rankin Inlet that I spoke to expressed a lack of trust in the abilities or motivations of southern mine workers to monitor the daily and long-term impacts of the Meliadine project. I asked a long-term Inuk resident, “Do you feel this mine is being put in place…by people who…won’t feel the impacts?” She responded, “I think they’ll [Agnico-Eagle] get hurt if they lose money, but that’s their only impact.” She paused. “All land is everyone’s land, and that’s how land should be treated. But that’s not how I feel they [southern mine workers] think about it. They think, ‘This is not my land, this is the Inuit land’, and that’s fine because that’s the major thing, you know, Inuit land beneficiaries and Inuit land claims agreements, and the identity of this land is very much, Inuit land.” She went on, “But that’s not how they feel that…that maybe it’s not their responsibility, though it is law that they should respect the land. I think that’s the only reason they would do that [follow rules outlined in the NLCA]. Because they have to.” </SPAN></P><P>Within this interview, she attempted to destabilize the simultaneous universality and invisibility of Western industrial notions of development, management and progress, arguing that there are other ways of being in place, understanding land, and being responsible as an environmental steward.</P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Returning back to the</SPAN><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> Nunatsiaq News </SPAN></I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">article, Kusugak asserts, “If you’re coming from a place like Toronto, do you have the same understanding of your backyard [as people in the Arctic]?” (Dawson 2013, 1). With the coming Meliadine project, residents are concerned about the impacts of having mining activity so near the community, and its impacts on land, wildlife, and socio-economic factors. Agnico-Eagle has worked to establish its social license to mine through sponsoring events such as a family day in Rankin Inlet that included games, food, music, and dancing, as well as building recreational facilities, such as the local baseball field. Yet, the grounded encounters between southern mine workers and residents in Rankin Inlet weave a complicated story of grappling with difference within a contact zone, which is rarely visible in academic, corporate, and policy research on mining. Glen Banks argues, “contested identities, altered identities, fractured identities: all these processes are happening…as a result of mining developments. They impact communities, resource developers, and the governments. They also spark conflict at mining sites and within [regions]. And they account better for these conflicts than explanations that reduce them to simple economics” (2004, 8).</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mining processes affect populations located nearest to the project, or ‘fence-line communities’ (Calvano 2008), who experience a disproportionate amount of the environmental and social costs of the project, yet only gain a portion of the short-term benefits. The development of the Meliadine gold project, located just 27 kilometres from the community of Rankin Inlet, interrupts local and trans-local ways of life. In particular, residents spoke about potential impacts to caribou migrations, contaminants in lakes, and the destruction of land and wildlife. Beyond environmental impacts, residents expressed worries over the influx of southern fly-in/fly-out workers in the community, strains on already stressed infrastructure and community organizations, and the need for Inuit participation at all stages of development and closure.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Local residents in Rankin Inlet also interrupt the business-as-usual model of multinational mining corporations operating on Inuit Owned Lands. Howitt and Suchet-Pearson argue that “the persistence of Indigenous epistemologies rooted in systems that predate the creation of colonial property rights and assertions of frontier conquest and dispossession, unsettles the dominant idea in…development discourses that… industrialization [is an] unproblematic [goal] for communities and nations” (2006, 323). Residents in Rankin Inlet continually monitor Agnico-Eagle’s activities and ensure that the processes within the NLCA and IIBAs are attended to. Further, residents defend their deep attachment to the land for hunting and other activities, challenging ontologies (ways of knowing) of land as (solely) a commodity to be exploited for resources. The presence of residents engaging daily with southern mine workers interrupts myths of Nunavut as mining’s last frontier. Instead, residents are engaged in a contact zone with southern workers, navigating complex conversations around difference, development, and colonial encounters. As Kusugak argues, “[Inuit history and colonialism], those are still real issues right now…When you appreciate a culture, it’s a sign of respect” (Dawson 2013, 1).◉</SPAN></P><P><STRONG>Footnotes</STRONG></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">[1] </SPAN><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">On May 18, 2011 the </SPAN><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Federal department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development was </SPAN><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">changed to Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada </SPAN><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">(AANDC).

The Kivalliq Inuit Association (KIA), the Government of Nunavut and the Baker Lake Hunters and Trappers Organization have all expressed concern over how a roadway connecting a new open pit mine to processing facilities at Meadowbank will affect caribou migration.</P><P>Their concerns appeared in their final written submissions to the Nunavut Impact Review Board, submitted in advance of the final public hearing on the project, which begins on Sept.19 in Baker Lake. Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. had an Aug. 28 deadline to submit its written response to concerns before the hearing.</P><P>The new mining operation — the Whale Tail pit — is about 50 kilometres northwest of Meadowbank. It would operate as an open pit mine for between three and four years, and requires a road connecting it to milling facilities at Meadowbank. Agnico Eagle expects mining could begin as early as 2019. <A href=""https://republicofmining.com/2017/08/29/worries-mount-over-what-busy-mining-road-in-nunavut-could-mean-for-caribou-migration-by-sara-frizzell-cbc-news-north-august-29-2017/#more-60273"" class=""more-link"">Continue Reading →</A></P></SECTION></ARTICLE></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

You can't possess radiance, you can only admire it.”</P><P>It’s a good philosophy, because when it comes to the world’s biggest, rarest and most extraordinary gemstone discoveries, no one—not even billionaire President Donald Trump—could afford the possession.</P><P>We’re not talking about the average diamond engagement ring that sets you back $4,000 and was probably grown in a lab. And we’re not talking about the $3,000 ruby that was probably treated.</P><P>We’re talking about the rarest gemstones in the world, like the ‘Guinness Emerald’ that came out of Fura Gems’ Coscuez emerald mine in Colombia, where excavation has only reached 10% and the next gem of the century is just waiting to be discovered.</P><P>Every year, the mining industry grows by hundreds of billions of dollars. The global economy is booming and demand for precious jewels, particularly colored gemstones, has never been higher.</P><P>That means that the greatest discoveries have yet to be made.</P><P>Here are just five examples of stones that broke all the records:</P><P><STRONG>#1 “Star of Adam” Blue Star Sapphire—$100-300 Million</STRONG></P><P>The world’s largest blue sapphire was discovered in Sri Lanka in early 2016. Named the “Star of Adam,” the massive stone weighs an incredible 1,404 carats.</P><P>The stone is a blue “star” sapphire, so named due to the bright six-pointed star that appears whenever light is reflected on the stone’s surface.</P><P>Estimates of the stone’s value range from the <A href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/05/worlds-largest-blue-star-sapphire-worth-up-to-175-million-found-in-sri-lanka.html"">$100-$175 million</A> range to as much as <A href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2016/01/10/worlds-largest-blue-star-sapphire-found-worth-300-million/#bfeb84275d1d"">$300 million</A>.</P><P>(Click to enlarge)This single stone is worth the annual gem industry of Sri Lanka, which averages <A href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35226276"">$103 million</A> per year in exports.</P><P>Interest in blue stones increased worldwide after the royal wedding of Kate Middleton and Prince William in 2011. Middleton wore a 12-carat blue sapphire engagement ring, piquing interest in the stones and sending demand upwards.</P><P>But the royal stone has nothing on the massive Star of Adam.</P><P><STRONG>#2 Guinness Emerald—$500 million</STRONG></P><P>Here’s a stone so grand, it made it into the Guinness Book of World Records.</P><P>The <A href=""http://famousdiamonds.tripod.com/guinnessemerald.html"">1759-carat</A> emerald was discovered at the Coscuez mine, owned by <A href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FURA.V/?p=FURA.V"">Fura Gems</A>. It was for several years the largest un-cut emerald on earth.</P><P>(Click to enlarge)Only 10 percent of the Coscuez mine has been explored, which means there could be several stones like the Guinness Record emerald locked underground.</P><P>Fura Gems recently announced its <A href=""http://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/fura-completes-acquisition-of-colombian-emerald-mine-coscuez-20180122-00254"">total take over</A> of the Coscuez mine. For only $10 million, the company took possession of a mine that could yield hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of emeralds just like the Guinness Emerald.</P><P>The stone, in its un-cut form, could be worth $17 million, at a valuation of <A href=""http://www.singhalinternational.com/tvalue.htm"">$9,800 per carat</A>.</P><P>But once it’s been cut, it could sell for a whole lot more. An 18-carat emerald ring, for example, sold at auction in June 2017 for <A href=""https://www.wpdiamonds.com/how-much-emerald-worth/"">$5.5 million</A>.</P><P>That means the Guinness Emerald could be worth more than $500 million to the right buyer.</P><P>Right now, the stone is <A href=""http://famousdiamonds.tripod.com/guinnessemerald.html"">resting comfortably</A> in the Banco Nacional in Colombia.</P><P><STRONG>#3 Chaiyo Ruby—$448 million</STRONG></P><P>This mysterious stone has quite the back-story.</P><P>The Chaiyo Ruby is an enormous gemstone weighing 109,000 carats: that’s roughly the same weight as a seven or eight-year old child.</P><P>The stone has been valued at <A href=""https://www.diamondrocks.co.uk/blog/The+History+and+Mystery+of+the+Chaiyo+Ruby.html"">approximately £320 million</A>, or about $448 million.</P><P>The ruby came out of a mine in south Asia, though where it was mined exactly is subject to considerable debate: both Myanmar and Thailand dispute ownership.</P><P>There have also been accusations that the stone is a fake, that it was <A href=""https://www.gemselect.com/other-info/biggest-gems.php"">manufactured in Myanmar</A>.</P><P>In fact, the stone is so mysterious, its current whereabouts are unknown. It vanished in the early 2000s, and may be sitting in a safety-deposit box in Laos. Some rumors speculate that it was stolen from its original owners by members of the Myanmar military.</P><P>Whatever the truth is, it’s certain that this massive stone is one of the rarest and richest finds of the recent era.</P><P><STRONG>#4 Bahia Emerald—$250-$925 million</STRONG></P><P><A href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6ob6zuO7YAhVPY98KHV6MAp0QFgguMAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBahia_Emerald&amp;usg=AOvVaw1rhJx1kp8aAQJ4OTTf0198"">The world’s largest emerald ever</A> uncovered in a single shard, the Bahia Emerald weighs approximately 1.7 million carats, or 752 lbs. It was discovered in the Bahia region of eastern Brazil.</P><P>The huge stone, which currently sits in a vault in Los Angeles, could be worth as much as $925 million.</P><P>(Click to enlarge)The incredible stone was stored for a time in New Orleans, and was nearly washed away by the flood waters of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.</P><P>Like the Chaiyo Ruby, the Bahia Emerald is shrouded in mystery. After surviving Katrina, the stone was stolen from a secure vault in South El Monte in Southern California in September 2008.</P><P>After the theft, the stone was tracked down and is now in the middle of a <A href=""https://www.wired.com/2017/03/curse-bahia-emerald-giant-green-rock-wreaks-havoc-ruins-lives/"">bitter legal battle</A> to determine <A href=""http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/12/27/giant.emerald/index.html"">rightful ownership</A>.</P><P>Eventually, the Bahia Emerald was awarded to FM Holdings in June 2015. But then the government of Brazil insisted it had been mined illegally, and that it rightfully belong to Brazil. That got the case started all over again.</P><P>Today, the world’s biggest emerald sits in an evidence vault at the LA sheriff’s office. Who knows when it will see the light of day.</P><P><STRONG>#5 Letseng Diamond--$50-$100 million</STRONG></P><P>In the tiny African country of Lesotho, a massive recent discovery was made: a 910-carat colorless, pure diamond.</P><P>(Click to enlarge)The 6.4 ounce stone is <A href=""https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/worlds-fifth-largest-diamond-found-lesotho-180967844/?q="">about the size of two golf balls</A>, but don’t let the size fool you: it could easily be worth tens of millions of dollars to the right buyer.</P><P>Another stone discovered by the same company sold for $20,000/carat. Analysts say the Letseng diamond could be worth <A href=""https://qz.com/1179935/worlds-fifth-largest-diamond-has-been-discovered-in-lesotho/"">as much as $40 million</A>, and possibly much more.</P><P>Colorless diamonds, which have no visible impurities, are very rare. They are also in high demand from jewelers.</P><P>The Letseng stone has <A href=""https://www.livescience.com/61445-910-carat-diamond-discovered.html"">almost no nitrogen</A> in its composition. Nitrogen can give diamonds a yellow hue, so the stone’s colorless look will make it shine much brighter once it’s been cut and polished.</P><P>And a stone of this size could easily yield a number of smaller stones, cut into various jewelry.</P><P>The largest diamond in history, for example, was the 3,106-carat <A href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cullinan_Diamond"">Cullinan diamond</A> discovered in 1905. It was later cut into nine large stones and more than 100 smaller ones.</P><P>This recent discovery makes it clear that huge value awaits to be unlocked by the world’s leading mining firms. Worldwide, mining firms <A href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/5-mining-companies-to-watch-in-2018-670678273.html"">added $141 billion</A> to their value last year.</P><P>And with specialized companies like <A href=""http://www.furagems.com/"">Fura Gems</A> at the forefront, there are sure to be huge, exciting discoveries. The world’s largest and most valuable diamonds and gemstones are waiting to be uncovered.</P><P>After all, records were made to be broken.</P><P><STRONG>Honorable mentions:</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX)</STRONG> is a multi-faceted mining company. The company’s focus is on gold and copper, but also delves into the realm of refining. With assets spanning the world, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. has been a long-time leader in the mining sector. As gold comes back into investors’ focus, Freeport-McMoRan’s $28B market cap make this company one of the biggest players on the scene.</P><P>Freeport has seen its stock price go 36% higher in December as a result of higher copper and gold prices.</P><P>Commodity investors should keep Freeport on their radar if gold and copper prices remain steady in 2018.</P><P><STRONG>Cameco Corporation (TSX:CCO, NYSE:CCJ)</STRONG> is the world’s largest publicly traded uranium company, accounting for nearly 18 percent of the world’s uranium production. Cameco made it onto this list of miners due to its mining expertise and wide range of assets.</P><P>Cameco’s operations are primarily based in North America, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia. Challenged with lower uranium prices, Cameco’s stock has suffered in the past year, but 2018 is looking promising for the company, with some suggesting a huge rebound is in sight.</P><P><STRONG>Newmont Mining Corp (NYSE:NEM, TSE:NMC)</STRONG> Founded over 100 years ago, Newmont Mining Corporation is one of the leading mining companies in the world. The company holds assets in Peru, Australia, Ghana, Indonesia, Mexico, and around the United States. Primarily focusing on gold and copper, Newmont has steadily carved out a name for itself among those in the industry.</P><P>Newmont has had an excellent start to 2018, and it is set to keep up the pace as burnt bitcoin buyers move back to gold and silver.</P><P><STRONG>Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC, TSE:K)</STRONG> is relatively new on the scene, founded in the early 90s, but it certainly isn’t lacking drive or experience. In 2015, the company received the highest ranking for of any Canadian miner in Maclean's magazine's annual assessment of socially responsible companies. With over 30 million ounces of proven or probable gold reserves, Kinross makes for a solid bet for investors.</P><P>The company has managed to outperform the gold miners index GDX as well as its peers Barrick and Newmont in 2017. Investors should expect Kinross to come out with its 2018 production guidance in early February 2018.</P><P><STRONG>Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd (NYSE:AEM; TSE:AEM)</STRONG> Canadian based gold producer, Agnico Eagle Mines is an especially noteworthy company for investors. Why? Between 1991-2010, the company paid out dividends every year. With operations in Quebec, Mexico, and Finland, the company also is taking place in exploration activities in Europe, Latin America, and the United States. This is certainly a company with tremendous potential that grows better by the day.</P><P>Investors have certainly taken note. In the past month, Agnico has seen its share prices climb steadily, and 2018 looks to be shaping up to be a promising year.</P><P>By Charles Kennedy</P><P><STRONG>NOT AN INVESTMENT ADVISOR.</STRONG> Oilprice.com is not registered or licensed by any governing body in any jurisdiction to give investing advice or provide investment recommendation.

Sea ice is a cornerstone of the environment and culture of the study area but is also the main barrier to shipping traffic, which has been growing in the area. This paper presents a review of sea ice and shipping in the study area and an analysis of shipping accessibility as represented by the timing of breakup, freeze-up, and the open water season in its offshore and local waters. Offshore ice timing was analyzed using passive microwave-based data for 1980–2014; local ice timing near Rankin Inlet, Churchill, Kuujjuarapik/Whapmagoostui, and Salluit was examined using Canadian Ice Service ice charts for 1996–2016. Open water was defined using sea ice concentration thresholds of ≤15% (offshore) or &lt;20% (local) in an attempt to represent accessible conditions for open water shipping vessels. The results for both offshore and local waters display considerable spatial variability. For offshore waters, breakup currently occurs between 17 May and 19 August and freeze-up occurs between 22 October and 30 December, with overall trends (1980–2014) of +0.58 days year–1 towards an earlier breakup, +0.47 days year–1 towards a later freeze-up, and +0.97 days year–1 towards a longer open water season. Also, significant relationships amongst breakup and freeze-up were observed. For local waters, the 1996–2016 average open water season at the four communities varied between 112.7 days (Churchill) and 154.7 days (Kuujjuarapik/Whapmagoostui). Ultimately, shipping accessibility to Rankin Inlet, Churchill, and Salluit appears to be limited by their local ice timing, while accessibility to Kuujjuarapik/Whapmagoostui appears to be limited by ice timing in northeastern Hudson Bay.</P></DIV><H5 style=""padding-top:10px;"">Knowledge Domain:  Ocean Science </H5></DIV><DIV xmlns:TEI=""http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"" id=""xml-article""><DIV id=""middle"" class=""article-body""><STRONG>Domain Editor-in-Chief: </STRONG>Jody W.

There is good reason for this grouping: although each of the four regions is unique, they all share a close oceanographic relationship (see, for example, <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B41"" data-scroll=""#B41"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B41"">Joly et al., 2011</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B38"" data-scroll=""#B38"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B38"">Hochheim and Barber, 2014</A></STRONG></SPAN>). Unfortunately, there is no consensus on the term used to refer to the four marine regions collectively. Examples in the literature include the Hudson Bay system, the Hudson Bay Complex, the Greater Hudson Bay Marine Region, and others. Throughout this paper we simply refer to Hudson Bay, James Bay, Hudson Strait, and Foxe Basin as the “study area” (Figure <SPAN class=""xref""><A href=""#F1"">1</A></SPAN>).</P><P>The study area encompasses five major administrative regions within Canada: Nunavik and Eeyou Istchee of northwestern Quebec, Nunavut, Manitoba, and Ontario. The area is home to 39 formal communities dotted along the coast (Figure <SPAN class=""xref""><A href=""#F1"">1</A></SPAN>), with a total population of roughly 50,000 (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B68"" data-scroll=""#B68"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B68"">Statistics Canada, 2016</A></STRONG></SPAN>). Indigenous people make up the vast majority of the population in these 39 communities. The majority of residents in the communities of Nunavut and Nunavik are Inuit, and the majority of residents in the coastal communities of Eeyou Istchee and northern Ontario are Cree (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B67"" data-scroll=""#B67"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B67"">Statistics Canada, 2011</A></STRONG></SPAN>). Of the 39 communities, only Churchill, Manitoba, and the nine communities of James Bay are accessible by rail or road (all-weather or winter). The remaining 29 communities (and roughly 27,000 people) can be accessed only by sea or air.</P><P>Sea ice is fundamental to the culture and sustenance of the Inuit people in the study area: sea ice is a seasonal extension of their homeland that enables travel and wildlife harvesting (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B40"" data-scroll=""#B40"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B40"">Inuit Circumpolar Council – Canada, 2008</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B6"" data-scroll=""#B6"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B6"">Aporta, 2010</A></STRONG></SPAN>). Inuit people have spent generations learning the nuances and subtleties of their local sea ice, and the seasonal ice covering forms a familiar, well-travelled topography (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B45"" data-scroll=""#B45"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B45"">Laidler and Elee, 2008</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B47"" data-scroll=""#B47"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B47"">Laidler et al., 2009</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B6"" data-scroll=""#B6"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B6"">Aporta, 2010</A></STRONG></SPAN>). Furthermore, many residents of the study area obtain a considerable portion of their food from wildlife harvested on sea ice (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B17"" data-scroll=""#B17"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B17"">Chan et al., 2006</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B26"" data-scroll=""#B26"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B26"">Ford, 2009</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B47"" data-scroll=""#B47"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B47"">Laidler et al., 2009</A></STRONG></SPAN>). On the other hand, sea ice is the greatest barrier to shipping in the study area (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B43"" data-scroll=""#B43"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B43"">Kelley and Ljubicic, 2012</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B21"" data-scroll=""#B21"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B21"">Engler and Pelot, 2013</A></STRONG></SPAN>). For shippers it is an obstacle and a hazard that prevents access and reduces shipping potential (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B7"" data-scroll=""#B7"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B7"">Aporta, 2011</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B10"" data-scroll=""#B10"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B10"">Brooks and Frost, 2012</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B43"" data-scroll=""#B43"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B43"">Kelley and Ljubicic, 2012</A></STRONG></SPAN>).

Put simply, the study area is seasonally covered with first-year ice (FYI), though small extents of second-year ice may be produced in Foxe Basin and migrate into northeastern Hudson Bay (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B29"" data-scroll=""#B29"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B29"">Gagnon and Gough, 2006</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B74"" data-scroll=""#B74"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B74"">Tivy et al., 2011</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B22"" data-scroll=""#B22"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B22"">Environment and <mark>Climate Change</mark> Canada, 2013</A></STRONG></SPAN>). In recent decades, the seasonal timing of ice in the study area has typically run as follows. Sea ice grows from north to south between September and December and melts in a complicated pattern (though generally south to north) between May and August (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B22"" data-scroll=""#B22"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B22"">Environment and <mark>Climate Change</mark> Canada, 2013</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B38"" data-scroll=""#B38"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B38"">Hochheim and Barber, 2014</A></STRONG></SPAN>). Foxe Basin is typically ice-free for parts of August and September, Hudson Strait is ice-free from July to November/December, and Hudson Bay and James Bay are ice-free from July/August until November/December (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B22"" data-scroll=""#B22"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B22"">Environment and <mark>Climate Change</mark> Canada, 2013</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B38"" data-scroll=""#B38"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B38"">Hochheim and Barber, 2014</A></STRONG></SPAN>). There is, however, considerable spatiotemporal variation within these broad patterns.</P><P>The formation, persistence, and melting of sea ice are not simple processes. There is some consensus that, on a broad scale, the timing of sea ice in the study area is largely determined by atmospheric temperatures and wind (i.e., thermodynamic and dynamic “forcing”; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B74"" data-scroll=""#B74"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B74"">Tivy et al., 2011</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B38"" data-scroll=""#B38"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B38"">Hochheim and Barber, 2014</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B54"" data-scroll=""#B54"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B54"">Ogi et al., 2016</A></STRONG></SPAN>). Sea ice is influenced by both the immediate impact of external forcing and by the legacy of recent forcing, via the ice-albedo feedback loop and “<mark>climate</mark> memory” (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B33"" data-scroll=""#B33"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B33"">Gough and Houser, 2005</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B64"" data-scroll=""#B64"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B64"">Serreze and Barry, 2011</A></STRONG></SPAN>). <mark>Climate</mark> memory refers to a circular process wherein the timing of ice at one point in the annual cycle influences the amount of heat stored in the surface waters, which in turn affects ice timing at a subsequent point in the cycle, and so on (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B33"" data-scroll=""#B33"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B33"">Gough and Houser, 2005</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B64"" data-scroll=""#B64"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B64"">Serreze and Barry, 2011</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B72"" data-scroll=""#B72"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B72"">Stroeve et al., 2016</A></STRONG></SPAN>). Numerous studies have shown relationships between the timing of breakup and freeze-up in waters of the study area (e.g., <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B39"" data-scroll=""#B39"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B39"">Houser and Gough, 2003</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B33"" data-scroll=""#B33"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B33"">Gough and Houser, 2005</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B72"" data-scroll=""#B72"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B72"">Stroeve et al., 2016</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B4"" data-scroll=""#B4"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B4"">Andrews et al., 2017</A></STRONG></SPAN>).</P><P>The first-year sea ice that covers the study area each year is not uniform. This first-year ice typically varies in thickness from 30 to 120 cm, with an average maximum ice thickness of 160 cm in Hudson Bay, as reported by Stewart and Lockhart (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B69"" data-scroll=""#B69"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B69"">2005</A></STRONG></SPAN>). The ice is influenced by local variations in air temperatures, wind, and current, and by other relatively local factors such as freshwater input and precipitation (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B29"" data-scroll=""#B29"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B29"">Gagnon and Gough, 2006</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B45"" data-scroll=""#B45"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B45"">Laidler and Elee, 2008</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B31"" data-scroll=""#B31"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B31"">Galley et al., 2012</A></STRONG></SPAN>). As a consequence, the ice of the study area grows, melts, rafts, and ridges in a variable pattern (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B38"" data-scroll=""#B38"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B38"">Hochheim and Barber, 2014</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B50"" data-scroll=""#B50"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B50"">Mussells et al., 2016</A></STRONG></SPAN>).</P><P>The great majority of sea ice in the study area is “mobile pack ice” – floating sea ice that moves according to ocean currents and winds (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B62"" data-scroll=""#B62"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B62"">Rampal et al., 2009</A></STRONG></SPAN>). Mobile pack ice follows distinct movement patterns in different regions of the study area. For example, the ocean currents in Hudson Bay flow counter-clockwise and push the mobile ice with them, which can result in dynamic thickening of ice in the eastern Bay during the ice season and raised ice concentrations in the southwest and south during spring breakup (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B29"" data-scroll=""#B29"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B29"">Gagnon and Gough, 2006</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B30"" data-scroll=""#B30"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B30"">Galbraith and Larouche, 2011</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B38"" data-scroll=""#B38"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B38"">Hochheim and Barber, 2014</A></STRONG></SPAN>).</P><P>During the ice season some sections of coastal ice become “landfast”. Landfast ice is defined as any relatively immobile and continuous sheet of ice that is grounded or anchored to land in some way (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B76"" data-scroll=""#B76"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B76"">Yu et al., 2014</A></STRONG></SPAN>).

One source of data is the vessel reports collected by the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) for the Northern Canada Vessel Traffic Zone (or “NORDREG” zone), which encompasses all Canadian waters north of 60°N and all of Hudson, James, and Ungava Bays. Between 1990 and 2010, vessels travelling through the NORDREG zone were requested to submit position reports to the CCG; since 2010, the submission of position reports has been mandatory for vessels over 300 tonnes (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B57"" data-scroll=""#B57"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B57"">Pizzolato et al., 2014</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B4"" data-scroll=""#B4"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B4"">Andrews et al., 2017</A></STRONG></SPAN>).

The CCG/University of Ottawa data for the study area suggest the following. Vessel traffic doubled from roughly 80 voyages per year for 1990–1995 to 160–180 voyages per year between 2010 and 2015. On average between 1990 and 2015, general cargo vessels were responsible for 27% of vessel traffic, bulk carriers were responsible for 23%, and tankers (likely carrying diesel fuel for re-supply) were responsible for 19%.

For example, sealift vessels travel from southern Quebec to the study area, make their scheduled stops, and then return to the south.

As previously indicated, most of the communities in the region (29 communities, roughly 27,000 people) can be accessed only by sea or air. As a result, marine re-supply (sealift) provides these communities with essential supplies that are too heavy or too costly to be flown, such as fuel, housing materials, construction supplies, vehicles, and non-perishable food items (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B40"" data-scroll=""#B40"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B40"">Inuit Circumpolar Council – Canada, 2008</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B8"" data-scroll=""#B8"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B8"">Arctic Council, 2009</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B10"" data-scroll=""#B10"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B10"">Brooks and Frost, 2012</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B5"" data-scroll=""#B5"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B5"">Andrews et al., 2016</A></STRONG></SPAN>).

The potential environmental consequences of shipping in the study area are made considerably more severe by the limited (or non-existent) shipping infrastructure, the difficulties of shipping in ice-infested waters, the relatively low quality bathymetric charts and navigational aids for the area, and the lack of monitoring, vessel support, and emergency response capacity (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B43"" data-scroll=""#B43"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B43"">Kelley and Ljubicic, 2012</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B18"" data-scroll=""#B18"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B18"">Commissioner of the Environment and <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development, 2014</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B36"" data-scroll=""#B36"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B36"">Government of Canada, 2015</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B5"" data-scroll=""#B5"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B5"">Andrews et al., 2016</A></STRONG></SPAN>).

Shipping traffic appears to have doubled in the study area between 1990 and 2015, and longer open water seasons and growing socio-economic demand will provide further stimulus for this trend. There are potential benefits to increased shipping: for example, increased sealift could lead to a lower cost of living; and shipping-enabled growth in the tourism, fishing, and mining sectors could bring welcome employment and economic growth. However, these potential benefits may be offset by the environmental impacts of shipping. A careful approach is needed for development of an environmentally responsible and socially beneficial shipping industry in the study area. Scientific research will be an important component of this approach. In this context, this paper presents our efforts to characterize offshore and local shipping accessibility with respect to sea ice in Hudson Bay, James Bay, Hudson Strait, and Foxe Basin between 1980 and 2016. More specifically, our research examines sea ice timing in offshore waters and in local waters near the four communities of Rankin Inlet, Churchill, Kuujuarapik/Whapmagoostui, and Salluit by analyzing three variables: breakup, freeze-up, and the open water season.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV><H2 class=""article-division"">Methods</H2><P>Our examination of sea ice in the study area addresses “offshore” and “local” sea ice using different data and methodologies. For the purposes of this research, “offshore” waters include all waters more than roughly 25–71 kilometres from shore, while “local” waters consist of specific “community areas” with radii of approximately 50 km near the four study communities. We do not distinguish between different types of sea ice in the offshore analysis, but we do distinguish between landfast and pack ice in the local analysis. Our rationale and methodology are explained below.</P><DIV><H3>Offshore sea ice analysis</H3><P>Offshore shipping accessibility was examined using the “Sea Ice Concentrations from Nimbus-7 SMMR and DMSP SSM/I-SSMIS Passive Microwave Data” dataset (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B15"" data-scroll=""#B15"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B15"">Cavalieri et al., 1996</A></STRONG></SPAN>, updated yearly) hosted by the National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC). This dataset provides daily sea ice concentrations on a 25 km × 25 km grid for 1980 to 2014. The study area defined in this analysis includes 1,559 of the 25 × 25 km “pixels” (Figure <SPAN class=""xref""><A href=""#F1"">1</A></SPAN>). The area was also subdivided into three regions for further analysis: Hudson Bay (1,181 pixels), Hudson Strait (197 pixels), and Foxe Basin (181 pixels). The “Hudson Bay” region defined for this analysis includes James Bay.</P><P>As can be seen in Figure <SPAN class=""xref""><A href=""#F1"">1</A></SPAN>, pixels directly bordering the coast were not included in the analysis. They were excluded for two reasons: to minimize the influence of near-shore landfast ice or any other highly local, coastline ice in our desired offshore results; and to avoid the erroneous data that can sometimes arise in passive-microwave datasets for near-shore locations. Because no pixels bordering the coast were included in the dataset, the offshore analysis excludes coastal marine waters up to a maximum of 71 km from shore, as follows. Pixels have dimensions of 25 × 25 km (and a diagonal length of ~35.4 km), and a pixel containing any land is labeled as “coast”. Thus pixels labeled as coast in the dataset may include marine waters up to 35.4 km offshore. As a result, pixels bordering the coast may actually border a region nearly 35.4 km from shore; the exclusion of these pixels therefore results in a data-less zone of up to 71 km (&lt;35.4 + 35.4 km) from shore.</P><P>The timing of open water conditions for each pixel from 1980–2014 was determined using the following method. For each year, breakup was recorded as the first of three consecutive days with ice concentrations ≤ 15%, freeze-up was recorded as the first of three consecutive days with ice concentrations &gt; 15%, and the open water season was the number of days between breakup and freeze-up. The three-day window used for breakup and freeze-up insured that transient ice motion and other short-term variations in ice concentration did not affect our analysis; we experimented with longer time windows (e.g., 7 days), but they made no appreciable difference to the results. The 15% concentration threshold for open water conditions was selected as the best representation of accessible conditions for open water shipping vessels. A 15% ice concentration has been similarly applied as a shipping accessibility threshold in several publications (e.g., <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B9"" data-scroll=""#B9"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B9"">Bensassi et al., 2016</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B4"" data-scroll=""#B4"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B4"">Andrews et al., 2017</A></STRONG></SPAN>) and more generally as an open water threshold in others (e.g., <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B66"" data-scroll=""#B66"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B66"">Stammerjohn et al., 2008</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B56"" data-scroll=""#B56"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B56"">Parkinson, 2014</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B72"" data-scroll=""#B72"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B72"">Stroeve et al., 2016</A></STRONG></SPAN>).</P><P>Regression analysis was used to examine trends in the timing of breakup, freeze-up, and the open water season for each pixel for 1980 to 2014. Statistical analysis suggested that the data for each variable follow a normal distribution and that no dataset exhibits significant autocorrelation. Multiple types of regression analysis were applied to the data, and linear regression yielded the best fits and the most statistically rigorous results for each variable. As a result, linear regression was used for the trend analysis. It has been suggested that sea ice timing is changing in a non-linear fashion in the study area (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B44"" data-scroll=""#B44"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B44"">Kowal et al., 2017</A></STRONG></SPAN>), but we did not observe this pattern in our data.

The CIS ice charts present the geographic distribution of sea ice within a region, with the ice grouped into “polygons” (i.e., areas) of equal ice concentration. Each polygon is labelled with information on the sea ice within it, including the ice concentration, stage of development, and form. But there is another layer of information: polygons often contain variation in the sea ice within them, and in these cases the different sub-areas of sea ice within each polygon are described. The CIS charts present ice concentrations in tenths (/10ths). Since 1982 the charts have been labelled using the ice “Egg Code” maintained by the World Meteorological Organization (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B23"" data-scroll=""#B23"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B23"">Environment and <mark>Climate Change</mark> Canada, 2016</A></STRONG></SPAN>).</P><P>The ice data from CIS charts have been used for numerous quantitative analyses published in the scientific literature but there are some important qualifiers and caveats. Put briefly, CIS ice charts have been created since the 1960s by ice experts using the best-available information from surface observations, aerial observations, and satellite data (both visual and microwave-based). However, “best-available” has changed since the 1960s and so has the demand for ice charts. As a result, the methodology used to create the charts and the frequency of their production has changed considerably over the decades. With respect to methodology, two points in particular are worth elaborating: the proportion of ice chart content derived from satellite observations and the proportion derived from “now-casting”. First, the proportion of ice chart data based on satellite observations grew from 15% prior to 1978, to 50–55% from 1978 to 1995, and finally to 80% in 1996 with the introduction of RADARSAT (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B12"" data-scroll=""#B12"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B12"">Canadian Ice Service, 2006</A></STRONG></SPAN>). Second, the CIS has often used a process called “now-casting” to produce ice charts when timely ice observations are not available. When now-casting, CIS experts estimate ice conditions at the time of the chart’s creation by extrapolating from earlier observations (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B12"" data-scroll=""#B12"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B12"">Canadian Ice Service, 2006</A></STRONG></SPAN>). The ice estimates based upon now-casting carry considerable uncertainty (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B74"" data-scroll=""#B74"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B74"">Tivy et al., 2011</A></STRONG></SPAN>). Prior to 1996, an average of 50% of the data in Arctic ice charts were the product of now-casting based on observations taken an average of 5 or more days prior to a chart’s creation (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B12"" data-scroll=""#B12"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B12"">Canadian Ice Service, 2006</A></STRONG></SPAN>). Since 1996, with the introduction of RADARSAT and the more timely availability of data, an average of only 20% of data in the Arctic charts has been produced through now-casting, from observations only 1 day prior to a chart’s creation (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B12"" data-scroll=""#B12"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B12"">Canadian Ice Service, 2006</A></STRONG></SPAN>).</P><P>Tivy et al. (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B74"" data-scroll=""#B74"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B74"">2011</A></STRONG></SPAN>) thoroughly examined the quality of the CIS sea ice data to assess their validity for statistical analysis. The authors discuss now-casting and technological changes and note a further important source of error: the quality of ice observations has not typically been homogeneous across all Arctic regions (or ice chart areas) at any given time. As a result there is variability in the quality of data within each ice chart, with the highest-quality data typically found near communities and shipping routes. For example, we observed that the region near Deception Bay (and the shipping route for the Raglan nickel mine) appeared to have more detailed data than surrounding areas in the ice charts for 2011 to 2016.</P><P>The CIS’s changing methodology has resulted in an archive of ice data that vary in quality both within and between charts, which affects the suitability of the data for statistical analyses. Nonetheless, after a thorough consideration of uncertainty and error, Tivy et al. (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B74"" data-scroll=""#B74"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B74"">2011</A></STRONG></SPAN>) ranked the CIS data for our study area as “fair” to “excellent” on their “Quality Index”, which was created to “portray the variability in data quality over space and time”. Furthermore, the CIS ice chart data has been used for numerous studies examining multi-decadal trends in ice conditions within our study area. For example, Tivy et al. (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B74"" data-scroll=""#B74"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B74"">2011</A></STRONG></SPAN>), Galbraith and Larouche (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B30"" data-scroll=""#B30"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B30"">2011</A></STRONG></SPAN>), and Kowal et al. (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B44"" data-scroll=""#B44"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B44"">2017</A></STRONG></SPAN>) all compare charts from the 1970s or 1980s to the present within their trend analyses. However, we deemed this methodology inappropriate for our application. The aforementioned articles applied the CIS data on a relatively large geographic scale, which may minimize some of the possible error from the sources discussed. Our research, on the other hand, seeks to examine sea ice conditions at a small, local scale. Out of caution, we used only CIS charts for 1996 to 2016 in our analysis; these charts are all within the RADARSAT era, they are largely based on satellite observations (~80%), and they contain relatively little content from now-casting (~20% on average).</P><P>Our four study communities – Rankin Inlet, Churchill, Kuuj/Whap, and Salluit – are all encompassed within the area of the CIS ice charts for the Hudson Bay region. These charts were created at a shifting frequency between 1996 and 2016. From 1980 to 2007 the charts were created monthly from January through April, every second week during May, and weekly from June through December. From 2007 to 2011 the charts were created every second week from January through March and weekly from April through December. Since 2008 the charts have been created on a weekly basis throughout the year. These general timing patterns, however, were occasionally interrupted by missing charts or longer time gaps.</P></DIV><DIV><H4 class=""tl-default"">Local breakup, freeze-up, and open water</H4><P>The 1996–2016 CIS ice charts for the Hudson Bay region were used to examine the local timing of landfast ice and the open water season for each of the four studies communities. “Local” here refers to the marine waters within a 50-km radius of Churchill and Kuuj/Whap, and within a 50-km radius of the entrance to the Rankin and Salluit inlets (“community areas” shown in Figure <SPAN class=""xref""><A href=""#F2"">2</A></SPAN>). Landfast ice is directly labelled in the CIS data, while “open water” was defined using an ice concentration threshold of &lt;20% (i.e., &lt;2 tenths). The 20% concentration threshold was selected because it is the closest option to the offshore threshold of ≤15%.</P><DIV class=""caption""><SPAN class=""label"">Figure 2

Breakup for landfast ice and open water conditions were defined as the first week without landfast ice and the first week with no sea ice of concentration ≥20%, respectively. Freeze-up for landfast ice and open water conditions were defined as the first week with landfast ice and the first week with ice concentrations ≥20%, respectively. The open water season was calculated as the number of weeks between open water breakup and freeze-up (i.e., &lt;20% concentration).</P><P>In some years multiple “break-up” events occurred in a community area as ice departed, returned, and departed again over a short time frame (e.g., 3 weeks); in these circumstances the final breakup was used for our record. Similarly, in some years multiple “freeze-up” events occurred; in these circumstances the earliest event was used for our record. As a result of this methodology our measurements reflect the latest possible breakup and earliest possible freeze-up, given the data, and therefore produce a relatively conservative estimate for open water conditions at the 20% ice concentration threshold.</P><P>Our data from the CIS ice charts were not examined for trends between 1996 and 2011. We did not feel confident that the results would be scientifically rigorous, because of the short 21-year time period and because the timing of the available CIS charts present some difficulties for analysis. The identification of ice timing (i.e., breakup or freeze-up date) using the CIS charts carries a minimum uncertainty of one week, which was the case with all breakup and freeze-up dates for the 20% concentration threshold. Furthermore, the freeze-up and breakup of landfast ice at the four communities occurred quite regularly during months where CIS charts were created only once per two weeks or once per month; in these cases, the identification of ice timing carried a two-week or one-month uncertainty. Finally, occasional ice charts were missing from the record, resulting in increased uncertainty for several measurements of landfast ice timing.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV><H3>Local versus offshore comparisons</H3><P>There is no consensus on whether ice concentration from CIS ice charts and passive-microwave observations may be partnered reliably for scientific analysis. Some studies have observed considerable discrepancies between ice concentrations from CIS charts versus passive-microwave methods (e.g., <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B1"" data-scroll=""#B1"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B1"">Agnew and Howell, 2003</A></STRONG></SPAN>), though others have indicated reasonable agreement in results from the two different data sources (e.g., <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B74"" data-scroll=""#B74"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B74"">Tivy et al., 2011</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B44"" data-scroll=""#B44"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B44"">Kowal et al., 2017</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B4"" data-scroll=""#B4"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B4"">Andrews et al., 2017</A></STRONG></SPAN>). In this article we do not compare results quantitatively from the two different analytical methods (local versus offshore). To compensate, the CIS charts were used to provide an element of offshore analysis: we tested each community breakup and freeze-up for the presence of a channel of open water extending continuously from the community area boundary to the eastern end of our study area as shown in Figure <SPAN class=""xref""><A href=""#F1"">1</A></SPAN>. There was no minimum width for the channel and there was no requirement of a direct route, only continuous open water conditions (ice concentration &lt; 20%) along some channel between the community area and the eastern edge of the study area at the time of local breakup or freeze-up.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV><H2 class=""article-division"">Results</H2><DIV><H3>Offshore sea ice analysis</H3><DIV><H4 class=""tl-default"">Current sea ice timing (2010–2014)</H4><P>Figure <SPAN class=""xref""><A href=""#F3"">3</A></SPAN> shows the median timing of open water conditions in the study area for 1981–1985, 1996–2000, and 2010–2014.

Following an initial screening by <ABBR title=""Nunavut Impact Review Board"">NIRB</ABBR> and recommendation that the project proposal be subject to a public review, the Project was referred to the <ABBR title=""Nunavut Impact Review Board"">NIRB</ABBR> for review under Article 12, Part 5 of the <ABBR title=""Nunavut Land Claims Agreement"">NLCA</ABBR>. The <ABBR title=""Nunavut Impact Review Board"">NIRB</ABBR> reviews the proposal to determine whether the project proposal should proceed, and if so, under what terms and conditions. This Agreement acknowledges and respects that the environmental review process is managed by the <ABBR title=""Nunavut Impact Review Board"">NIRB</ABBR> and that most timelines during the review are established by the <ABBR title=""Nunavut Impact Review Board"">NIRB</ABBR> and may be subject to change at the discretion of the Board.

Each of the federal regulatory authorities must manage the regulatory permitting process in accordance with its governing legislation and policies, but also may be required to modify timelines to coordinate with the <ABBR title=""Nunavut Impact Review Board"">NIRB</ABBR> process.</P></SECTION><SECTION><H2 id=""chp5"">5.0	Project Description</H2><P>The Proponent proposes to build, operate and decommission an underground and open-pit gold mine and processing facilities near Meliadine Lake, Nunavut, approximately 25 kilometres north of Rankin Inlet. Mining is proposed on six gold deposits on the property. Open-pit mining is proposed for the Tiriganiaq, Pump, Wolf and Discovery deposits using surface-mining methods. Underground mining proposed for the Tiriganiaq deposit, and a combination of open-pit and underground mining scenario is proposed for the Wesmeg and F zone deposits. A mill will be built on the site. Gold will be transported off-site via air to the Royal Canadian Mint. The anticipated mine life is 10 years. If approved, this would be the second operating gold mine in the territory by the same company.</P><P>The scope of the project review includes:</P><UL class=""lst-spcd""><LI><STRONG>Construction:</STRONG> Mine and milling facilities and mine-site access roads.</LI><LI><STRONG>Mining Operations:</STRONG> Mining of gold from 6 deposits (Tiriganiaq, Pump, Wolf, Wesmeg, F-zone and Discovery) including removal and transportation of material from the pits, processing of ore, smelting and handling of gold-bars on site.</LI><LI><STRONG>Milling Operations:</STRONG> All extracted ore from the mine sites will be processed through a mill located at the Meliadine site using a conventional gold-milling circuit. The mill will process approximately 8,500 tons per day.</LI><LI><STRONG>Tailings Management:</STRONG> Tailings will be piped to the tailings impoundment area through an insulated, heat traced pipeline with water reclaimed from the impoundment to the mill through a similar parallel pipeline.

There are currently two drills on the Olmeca prospect with a third drill expected to be added later in <SPAN class=""xn-chron"">February 2017</SPAN>.</P><P itemprop=""articleBody"">The Socorro Vein has been defined as a 1,600-metre long, east-northeast-striking, and steeply north-dipping, gold-bearing structure that includes high-grade gold values. Initial intercepts from the Socorro Vein were reported by the Company in 2016. The Socorro Vein remains open to the east, to the west and at depth.  Additional drilling is planned in the first half of 2017 to test for extensions to this structure and to test for additional subparallel structures.</P><P itemprop=""articleBody"">The Mortero Vein, located some 2.0 kilometres west of the Socorro Vein, has been delineated over a 300-metre strike length and to a depth of approximately 300 metres. High grade silver values have been found such as in hole OLM16-066 that intersected 1,111 g/t silver over 16.4 metres at 124 metres depth, including 4,195 g/t silver over 3.4 metres at 125 metres depth.  Gold values have generally been low in this part of the system and additional drilling is required at depth to test for a potentially higher grade gold zone. The Mortero Vein is open in all directions with drilling continuing at depth and along strike both to the east and west.</P><P itemprop=""articleBody"">It is unclear whether the Socorro and <SPAN class=""xn-location"">Mortero</SPAN> veins form part of the same mineralized structure.  The Company believes there is strong potential for additional structures.</P><P itemprop=""articleBody"">Five additional subparallel gold-bearing structures with extensive alteration zones have been located within the Olmeca area through prospecting, and geological mapping as well as soil, rock, and hyperspectral surveys.  Drilling commenced on both the <SPAN class=""xn-location"">Tierra Blanca</SPAN> and Carmen targets in late 2016 and will continue into the first quarter of 2017.</P><P itemprop=""articleBody""><SPAN style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Cuauhtémoc Area</SPAN></P><P itemprop=""articleBody"">Drilling will begin in this area shortly, initially with two drills tracing the southwest extent of the Azteca-Zapoteca Zone. A gold-bearing structure has been defined over a length of approximately 2,000 metres from surface mapping.</P><P itemprop=""articleBody""><SPAN style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Additional Target Areas</SPAN></P><P itemprop=""articleBody"">Approximately 45,000 metres of additional drilling is expected to be completed by the end of 2017 at the El Barqueno project, principally at the Socorro, Mortero, Tierra Blanca, Cuauhtémoc, Peña de Oro, Peña Blanca, <SPAN class=""xn-location"">San Diego</SPAN>, and <SPAN class=""xn-location"">El Rayo</SPAN> prospects and in the Tecolote-Tortuga areas, within the south area of the El Barqueno project.  Exploration expenditures in 2017 are expected to total approximately <SPAN class=""xn-money"">$16.8 million</SPAN>.</P><P itemprop=""articleBody"">While it is too early to estimate the full extent of the mineral resources and the number of deposits with economic potential at El Barqueno, the Company has the experience of developing cost-efficient mining operations in <SPAN class=""xn-location"">Mexico</SPAN> and increasing their size through successful exploration as well as metallurgical <mark>innovation</mark>.  This experience will be applied as El Barqueno continues to be explored and studied.</P><P itemprop=""articleBody"">Agnico Eagle believes that El Barqueno ultimately has the potential to be developed into a series of open pits utilizing heap leach and/or mill processing, similar to the <SPAN class=""xn-location"">Pinos Altos</SPAN> mine.  Conceptual design studies and additional metallurgical testing are ongoing at El Barqueno.</P><P itemprop=""articleBody""><STRONG>Senior Management Changes</STRONG></P><P itemprop=""articleBody""><SPAN class=""xn-person"">Tim Haldane</SPAN>, Senior Vice-President Operations - <SPAN class=""xn-location"">USA</SPAN>&amp;<SPAN class=""xn-location"">Latin America</SPAN> retired in early February this year.  Tim was instrumental in the acquisition and development of the Company's Mexican mining operations and greatly contributed to the Company's excellent operating performance.  He will continue to serve the Company as an advisor to senior management.</P><P itemprop=""articleBody"">Additional changes to Agnico Eagle's senior management team include:</P><P itemprop=""articleBody""><SPAN class=""xn-person"">Marc Legault</SPAN> has moved into a new role as Senior Vice-President Operations <SPAN class=""xn-location"">USA</SPAN>, Mexico &amp;<SPAN class=""xn-location"">Latin America</SPAN>.  In this role Marc will manage Agnico Eagle's

itemprop=""articleBody"">Agnico Eagle is a senior Canadian gold mining company that has produced precious metals since 1957.  Its eight mines are located in <SPAN class=""xn-location"">Canada</SPAN>, <SPAN class=""xn-location"">Finland</SPAN> and <SPAN class=""xn-location"">Mexico</SPAN>, with exploration and development activities in each of these countries as well as in <SPAN class=""xn-location"">the United States</SPAN> and <SPAN class=""xn-location"">Sweden</SPAN>.  The Company and its shareholders have full exposure to gold prices due to its long-standing policy of no forward gold sales.  Agnico Eagle has declared a cash dividend every year since 1983.</P><P itemprop=""articleBody""><STRONG>Note Regarding Certain Measures of Performance</STRONG></P><P itemprop=""articleBody"">This news release discloses certain measures, including &quot;total cash costs per ounce&quot;, &quot;all-in sustaining costs per ounce&quot;, &quot;minesite costs per tonne&quot;, &quot;net debt&quot; and &quot;adjusted net income&quot; that are not standardized measures under IFRS.  These data may not be comparable to data reported by other issuers.  For a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable financial information reported in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS, other than adjusted net income, see &quot;Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures&quot; below.  The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced is reported on both a by-product basis (deducting by-product metal revenues from production costs) and co-product basis (before by-product metal revenues).  The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis is calculated by adjusting production costs as recorded in the consolidated statements of income for by-product revenues, unsold concentrate inventory production costs, smelting, refining and marketing charges and other adjustments, and then dividing by the number of ounces of gold produced.  The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a co-product basis is calculated in the same manner as the total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis except that no adjustment is made for by-product metal revenues.  Accordingly, the calculation of total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a co-product basis does not reflect a reduction in production costs or smelting, refining and marketing charges associated with the production and sale of by-product metals.  The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced is intended to provide information about the cash-generating capabilities of the Company's mining operations.  Management also uses these measures to monitor the performance of the Company's mining operations.  As market prices for gold are quoted on a per ounce basis, using the total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis measure allows management to assess a mine's cash-generating capabilities at various gold prices. </P><P itemprop=""articleBody"">The Company calculates all-in sustaining costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis as the aggregate of total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis, sustaining capital expenditures (including capitalized exploration), general and administrative expenses (including stock options) and reclamation expenses, and then dividing by the number of ounces of gold produced.  The all-in sustaining costs per ounce of gold produced on a co-product basis is calculated in the same manner as the all-in sustaining costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis, except that the total cash costs per ounce on a co-product basis are used, meaning no adjustment is made for by-product metal revenues.  All-in sustaining costs per ounce is used to show the full cost of gold production from current operations.  Management is aware that these per ounce measures of performance can be affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and, in the case of total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis, by-product metal prices.  Management compensates for these inherent limitations by using these measures in conjunction with minesite costs per tonne (discussed below) as well as other data prepared in accordance with IFRS. </P><P itemprop=""articleBody"">Minesite costs per tonne are calculated by adjusting production costs as recorded in the consolidated statements of income for unsold concentrate inventory production costs, and then dividing by tonnes of ore processed.  As the total cash costs per ounce of gold produced can be affected by fluctuations in by‑product metal prices and foreign exchange rates, management believes that minesite costs per tonne provides additional information regarding the performance of mining operations, eliminating the impact of varying production levels.  Management also uses this measure to determine the economic viability of mining blocks.  As each mining block is evaluated based on the net realizable value of each tonne mined, in order to be economically viable the estimated revenue on a per tonne basis must be in excess of the minesite costs per tonne.  Management is aware that this per tonne measure of performance can be impacted by fluctuations in processing levels and compensates for this inherent limitation by using this measure in conjunction with production costs prepared in accordance with IFRS. </P><P itemprop=""articleBody"">Net debt is calculated by adjusting the total of the current portion of long-term debt and non-current long-term debt as recorded on the consolidated balance sheet for deferred financing costs, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.  Management uses net debt to determine the overall debt position and to evaluate future debt capacity of the Company. </P><P itemprop=""articleBody"">Adjusted net income is calculated by adjusting the basic net income per share as recorded in the consolidated statements of income for foreign currency translation gains and losses, mark-to-market adjustments, non-recurring gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments.  Management uses adjusted net income to evaluate the underlying operating performance of the Company and to assist with the planning and forecasting of future operating results.  Management believes that adjusted net income is a useful measure of performance because foreign currency translation gains and losses, mark-to-market adjustments, non-recurring gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments do not reflect the underlying operating performance of the Company and may not be indicative of future operating results.</P><P itemprop=""articleBody"">Management also performs sensitivity analyses in order to quantify the effects of fluctuating foreign exchange rates and metal prices.  This news release also contains information as to estimated future total cash costs per ounce, all-in sustaining costs per ounce and minesite costs per tonne.  The estimates are based upon the total cash costs per ounce, all-in sustaining costs per ounce and minesite costs per tonne that the Company expects to incur to mine gold at its mines and projects and, consistent with the reconciliation of these actual costs referred to above, do not include production costs attributable to accretion expense and other asset retirement costs, which will vary over time as each project is developed and mined.  It is therefore not practicable to reconcile these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable IFRS measure.</P><P itemprop=""articleBody""><STRONG>Forward-Looking Statements</STRONG></P><P itemprop=""articleBody"">The information in this news release has been prepared as at <SPAN class=""xn-chron"">February 15</SPAN>, 2017.  Certain statements contained in this news release constitute &quot;forward-looking statements&quot; within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and &quot;forward-looking information&quot; under the provisions of Canadian provincial securities laws and are referred to herein as &quot;forward-looking statements&quot;.  When used in this news release, the words &quot;anticipate&quot;, &quot;could&quot;, &quot;estimate&quot;, &quot;expect&quot;, &quot;forecast&quot;, &quot;future&quot;, &quot;plan&quot;, &quot;possible&quot;, &quot;potential&quot;, &quot;will&quot; and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  Such statements include, without limitation: the Company's forward-looking production guidance, including estimated ore grades, project timelines, drilling results, metal production, life of mine estimates, total cash costs per ounce, all-in sustaining costs per ounce, minesite costs per tonne, other expenses and cash flows; the estimated timing and conclusions of technical reports and other studies; the methods by which ore will be extracted or processed; statements concerning the Company's plans to build operations at Meliadine, Amaruq and LaRonde Zone 5 including the timing and funding thereof; statements concerning other expansion projects, recovery

statements regarding the sufficiency of the Company's cash resources and other statements regarding anticipated trends with respect to the Company's operations, exploration and the funding thereof.  Such statements reflect the Company's views as at the date of this news release and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.  Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of factors and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by Agnico Eagle as of the date of such statements, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies.  The material factors and assumptions used in the preparation of the forward looking statements contained herein, which may prove to be incorrect, include, but are not limited to, the assumptions set forth herein and in management's discussion and analysis (&quot;MD&amp;A&quot;) and the Company's Annual Information Form (&quot;AIF&quot;) for the year ended <SPAN class=""xn-chron"">December 31, 2015</SPAN> filed with Canadian securities regulators and that are included in its Annual Report on Form 40-F for the year ended <SPAN class=""xn-chron"">December 31, 2015</SPAN> (&quot;Form 40-F&quot;) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &quot;SEC&quot;) as well as: that there are no significant disruptions affecting operations; that production, permitting, development and expansion at each of Agnico Eagle's properties proceeds on a basis consistent with current expectations and plans; that the relevant metal prices, foreign exchange rates and prices for key mining and construction supplies will be consistent with Agnico Eagle's expectations; that Agnico Eagle's current estimates of mineral reserves, mineral resources, mineral grades and metal recovery are accurate; that there are no material delays in the timing for completion of ongoing growth projects; that the Company's current plans to optimize production are successful; and that there are no material variations in the current tax and regulatory environment.  Many factors, known

(PHOTO BY BETH BROWN) </DIV><P>Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. wants to do more than just dig for gold in Nunavut.</P><P>The multinational corporation, which operates mine sites in Nunavut’s Kivalliq region, signed a memorandum of understanding with the Government of Nunavut Sept. 20, pledging to collaborate with the territory on 10 high-profile “priority areas.”</P><P>Those areas are: health, education, training, economic development, infrastructure, housing, heritage resources, wildlife, public safety, and <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>“None of those are directly mining related,” Agnico Eagle president Ammar Al-Joundi said during a media event at the Nunavut Legislative Assembly in Iqaluit. </P><P>But, they are areas that are “absolutely essential” to good mining in the long run, he said, calling the MOU and investment in Nunavummiut all part of the company’s business strategy. </P><P>The MOU came with no budget or specific funding source. But a spokesperson for the mining company, Dale Coffin, said later that a working group will be struck to further the memorandum’s goals and that any related costs would be borne by Agnico Eagle or the GN.</P><P>Agnico Eagle plans to invest $1.5 billion to renew and increase its mining operations in Nunavut, through development of its <A href=""http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/stories/article/65674construction_at_newest_nunavut_gold_mine_on_schedule/"" title=""Meliadine"">Meliadine</A> mine site and <A href=""http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/stories/article/65674nunavut_regulators_deliver_concerns_on_nunavut_gold_mine_project/"" title=""Whale Tail "">Whale Tail </A>gold deposit. </P><P>The mining company also owns the <A href=""http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/stories/article/65674agnico_eagle_proposes_to_expand_open_pit/"" title=""Meadowbank gold mine"">Meadowbank gold mine</A>, north of Baker Lake, which has been operating since 2009 and expects to wind down next year, in 2018.</P><P>And if Nunavummiut are willing, the company is hoping to develop more sites in the coming years, Al-Joundi said. </P><P>“If you really want to be a good miner, you’ve got to be there for a long time. You’ve got to know the communities. You’ve got to know the suppliers. You’ve got to work with the contractors and you’ve got to understand that what really makes successful long term investment is having the community buy in. It has to be to their benefit,” he said.</P><P>Monica Ell-Kanayuk, the GN’s minister of economic development and transportation, who signed the MOU with Agnico Eagle, said that benefit will come mostly though training and employment opportunities.</P><P>“This company has shown it understands that the territory’s development hinges on good health, its employees and the well-being of their community… They will find that supporting and investing in their Nunavut workforce makes good business sense,” she said in her announcement of the MOU.</P><P>When asked if she was satisfied with how Agnico was pursuing Inuit employment targets, Ell-Kanayuk told <I>Nunatsiaq News</I>: “Their goal is a good one, They have said that they have 100 per cent employment of local people in Mexico and Finland, and that is what they are striving towards here in Nunavut, and we believe that.”</P><P>Around one-third of Agnico employees in Nunavut are Inuit.</P><P>“We are making good progress towards the benchmarks,” Al-Joundi told <I>Nunatsiaq News</I>. That benchmark is 50 per cent Inuit employment. </P><P>Al-Joundi said the company has not hired a non-Inuk heavy equipment operator in Nunavut in six years. The next step will be to employ more Inuit at a management level, and as engineers and geologists, he said. </P><P>“Our vision is that they are all Nunavummiut. However, that’s going to take some time,” he said. </P><P>Al-Joundi said the company is looking forward to hiring graduates from Nunavut Arctic College. </P><P>As for the 10 priorities, now that this new relationship is underway, organizers will strike a steering committee to see how those priorities can be put into practice. </P><P>Agnico Eagle said efforts to fulfill the MOU will be focused on the Kivalliq region.

Some of these tools, such as the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, apply universally to all companies. Others, such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, are the result of multi-stakeholder collaborations between companies, governments, and civil society. Some tools, such as the Mining Association of Canada’s Towards <mark>Sustainable</mark> Mining initiative, have been developed specifically by and for the mining industry. In all cases, these tools provide advice that mining companies can use when developing or implementing their CSR practices.

It marks 60 years of profitable growth, global expansion and value creation for our company. Throughout our years in business, we have consistently generated superior returns for our shareholders, while enhancing the employee experience and making significant contributions to our communities.</P><P>2017 also marks the closing of one chapter in our journey and the start of another. After five years of planning and preparation, we are ready to embark on the next phase of growth for Agnico Eagle. That growth will be mainly self-funded and will enable us to achieve our goal of producing 2 million ounces of gold annually in 2020.</P><P>What has led to this level of success for Agnico Eagle for over 60 years?</P><P>The hallmarks of our success have been our discipline and our resiliency. Our discipline has helped us maintain a strong balance sheet, grow production per share and generate above average returns. It has allowed us to remain flexible and to take advantage of opportunities when they arise, as we prudently manage risk. Our resiliency also sets us apart from our peers. We are resilient because, over time, our Board of Directors has trusted us to build a stronger and better company and our employees have remained committed to us, always going the extra mile to ensure our success.</P><P>Over the past 20 years, with their support, Agnico Eagle has evolved from a company with revenues of $50 million, a share price of $5, EBITDA of $4 million and a market capitalization of $200 million; into a company that today has revenues of over $2 billion, a share price of $55, EBITDA of $956 million and a market capitalization of $12 billion.</P><P>We have also evolved from a regionally focused gold mining business into an internationally recognized and sophisticated business. Our goal has long been to build a great business – not just a great gold business – one that generates superior returns while remaining committed to our core values of trust, respect, equality, family and responsibility.</P><P>In just over seven years, we have expanded from one gold mine in Quebec with 350 employees to eight mines in Mexico, Canada and Finland, with over 8,300 employees. Our success in delivering <mark>sustainable</mark> and profitable growth was noted in the <SPAN class=""font--italic"">2016 Harvard Business Review’s</SPAN> list of the world’s 100 best-performing companies – which ranked Agnico Eagle 55th based on results over time using both financial and ESG (environmental, social, governance) rankings – the highest of the four Canadian companies ranked and one of only four mining companies included on the list.</P><P>As we celebrate 60 years of success in business, I want to thank our employees and our Board of Directors for their guidance, commitment and support. Together, <STRONG>we are proud of our past and focused on our future</STRONG>.</P><P><STRONG>Proud of Our Past</STRONG>
						Since the completion of our last phase of growth in 2011, we have grown Agnico Eagle’s output by almost 60%, reduced our costs, increased our margins, and invested cash in the future of our business. Those investments have included buying assets, reducing our net debt, expanding our drill programs, grass roots exploration, advancing our key projects and investing in our people.</P><P>In 2016, we achieved our operating goals and key development milestones. For the fifth year in a row, our operations exceeded their production targets. In May, we received the necessary permitting to advance development of our Meliadine property in Nunavut and we continued to expand and upgrade the gold resources at our Amaruq deposit. Exploration work at Barsele, Sisar, El Barqueño and Canadian Malartic’s Odyssey properties yielded strong results. Financially, our operations performance was below guidance and we continued to lower our net debt.</P><P>Our strong performance between 2012 and 2016 has laid the groundwork for the next phase of growth at Agnico Eagle. Over the next three years, we plan to increase our output from roughly 1.6 million ounces of gold to 2 million ounces of gold annually.</P><P>We will achieve this growth by remaining focused on Agnico Eagle’s high quality, low risk growth strategy. Our growth will come from properties we own and from mines that are already producing, leveraging off the skills we already have and executed by people who are seasoned leaders in our business.</P><P>Taking centre stage in the next phase of growth will be Nunavut, which is an emerging high quality production platform for our company. With Agnico Eagle’s unique logistical advantages and expertise, we remain the dominant player in Canada’s north.</P><P><STRONG>Focused on Our Future</STRONG>
						What does the future hold for Agnico Eagle? While ongoing uncertainty in the world, whether financial or political, will make the markets difficult to predict over the next few years, we feel confident of the following:</P><P>– Our Nunavut footprint will continue to expand. In 2016 alone, Amaruq’s mineral resource grew by 29%, while the Meliadine deposit is expected to produce more than 5 million ounces of gold over an estimated 14 year mine life. In both cases, current plans contemplate mining approximately half of the known gold mineralization, so upside is possible. As we go forward, we anticipate Agnico Eagle will have additional operating bases and that we will be able to leverage our skills to find and develop new assets and generate superior returns for our shareholders.</P><P>– We will continue to build trust with our host communities by setting, and delivering on, high standards of community and sustainability performance. This is especially important in the sensitive Nunavut environment but holds true for all of our operations. We are committed to being a good neighbour and to receiving social acceptance from our stakeholder communities in order to advance our development projects.</P><P>– The key to our future will most certainly be our people. As we develop the next generation of leaders for our company, we remain committed to employing the best and the brightest who can bring the next generation of mines into being. Not only will it take <mark>innovation</mark> and skill, it will take leaders who can both manage the risk and see the opportunity in a new deposit or an emerging mining region. These are the people who will ultimately generate value for our company well into the future.</P><P>For 2017, we anticipate another year of solid production and the advancement of our key development projects.

The incident occurred on the Saturday night of the Labour Day long weekend and was not reported until the following Tuesday.</P><P class=""font--s2"">2. Two category 3 events occurred during the year: 1) Approximately 1,190 litres of fuel spilled at the Meliadine project site in Nunavut when a contractor operator was filling a fuel truck holding tank. Due to the winter conditions, the operator took shelter briefly inside the truck cabin leaving the filling operation unattended which led to the overflow. Immediate action was taken to stop the fuel pump and contain the spill. All contaminated material and soil was collected and transferred to Meliadine’s licensed land farm. The incident was reported to the authorities and refresher training on the procedure was given to the employee. 2) A contractor’s tractor-trailer hauling containers to the Meadowbank mine slid off the road while trying to climb a hill and encountered slow traffic ahead. The tractor rolled on its side resulting in about 300 litres of diesel fuel that spilled, causing a small amount of ammonium nitrate bags in the containers to open and spill on to the frozen ground. Immediate action was taken to contain the fuel. All contaminated material was collected and removed to the Meadowbank mine for proper management and disposal. An investigation was conducted and the root cause identified as a problem in the preventive maintenance of the tractor trailer which was revised as a result. The incident was declared to the authorities.</P></DIV></SECTION></DIV><DIV class=""section"" id=""section-7"" data-title=""Operational Overview""><SECTION class=""banner banner--overview lazy"" data-src=""../dist/images/banners/op-overview.jpg""><DIV class=""container container--sm""><H2 class=""font--l2 color--white text--underline text--shadow"">Operational Overview</H2><DIV class=""row row--flex""><DIV class=""col-4""><P class=""font--l6 color--white text--shadow"">in our <EM>quarterly dividend</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class=""content bg--white""><DIV class=""container container--sm""><P class=""color--black font--m2"">Agnico Eagle’s mission is to build a high-quality, easy to understand business — one that generates superior long-term returns for our shareholders, creates a great place to work for our employees, and contributes positively to the communities in which we operate.</P><P class=""color--black font--m2"">Our operations exceeded their production targets in 2016, with better than expected costs, allowing us to increase our guidance to the market for the fifth year in a row.</P><P class=""color--black font--m2"">In 2016, payable gold production totaled 1,662,888 ounces of gold, with total cash costs per ounce of $573.

								We anticipate receiving the required permits for Amaruq’s development during the second quarter of 2018.</P><P>We are currently working closely with the Nunavut Impact Review Board (NIRB) and the Nunavut Water Board (NWB) on the Whale Tail pit joint permitting process, which is progressing along the schedule and process outlined by the NIRB in November 2016. On January 27, 2017, the NIRB and NWB announced the start of the project technical review, which will lead to the start of public hearings at the end of the third quarter 2017. Approval for the project certificate and water license (Phase 1 – Whale Tail pit) is expected in the third quarter of 2018.</P><P class=""pipe__spacer"">On April 15, 2016, the NWB approved the Meliadine Project Type A Water License, which was issued on May 19, 2016.

Mining is expected to begin in mid-2018, with average annual production expected to be 45,000 ounces per year through 2026. The total capital cost to bring LaRonde Zone 5 into production is estimated at approximately $80 million.</P><P>In 2016, drilling in the eastern portion of the LaRonde 3 deposit led to the addition of 200,000 ounces of gold in reserves (1.2 million tonnes grading 5.15 g/t gold) – the first mineral reserves declared below Level 311.

								As we embark on this next phase of growth, we have focused on establishing solid succession plans to secure our business for the long-term.

Below are some examples of the challenges associated with implementing CSR encountered by Canadian mining and exploration companies:</P><H2>Responses by Company</H2><P>The most challenging aspect of planning for and applying CSR practices is social acceptability.</P><H3>American Vanadium Corp.</H3><P>As a start-up company there are many competing priorities, and developing policies and systems to implement them with a very small staff and limited resources is difficult. The company must rely on the experience of the staff developing the project to integrate CSR practices.</P><H3>Angkor Gold Corp.</H3><P>We are starting at the beginning, meaning we are educating everyone in the country (Cambodia), from locals to the Ministry of Mines, about what CSR is, how it can be implemented to benefit all stakeholders, and getting non-traditional participants to the table. Challenging aspects include finding human resources that understand this undertaking from an industry perspective and can execute it in- country, and a major shortage of skilled staff, because most of them will come from an NGO background, which is VERY different than a for-profit model.</P><H3>AuRico Gold Inc.</H3><P>Meeting the community expectations against the company's ability and financial capacity is recognized as a challenge.</P><H3>Banro Corporation</H3><P>There are many, many challenges. The unrealistic expectations of local communities is perhaps one of the largest, as is preventing and acting against corruption by local suppliers and partners. Our sites are remote and not easily accessed in a region with limited transportation infrastructure, which makes logistics a severe challenge at times. The communities are, historically, deeply divided between different factions, which sometimes makes it difficult to negotiate between different groups and respond to the legitimate goals of entire communities.  Financing these projects discussed above remains an ongoing challenge, particularly during downturns in the mining cycle.</P><H3>Cameco Corporation</H3><P>The most challenging part of planning and applying CSR practices is that the target for success is constantly moving. Stakeholders are constantly re-defining what they want from companies, whether it concerns jobs, the environment, or engagement standards. This requires companies to continually engage, update practices and policies, and the definition of &quot;success&quot; when it comes to CSR.</P><H3>Candente Copper Corp.</H3><P>Some challenges include cost-effective public relations in areas dominated by politically motivated communications, and creating Benefit Continual Management (costs and effective implementation). Another is truly addressing complex issues of development in areas with high levels of poverty. Finally the ability of the company to evolve with changes, and prioritize improving CSR practices in complex environments and high impact developments.</P><H3>Delta Gold Corp.</H3><P>One challenge is finding employees and contractors that share our very high ethical and moral standards. Another is training these to do exactly what we demand. </P><H3>Handa Copper Corp.</H3><P>The most challenging aspects are implementing practices in jurisdictions where the appropriate administrative infrastructure is not in place and the practice of the company may be at a level not familiar to the communities in which we work. Often the company practices are at a level not legislated for or adopted by local government. There is therefore often a large education and sensitization component required which the company may not have the resources to fully accommodate.</P><H3>HudBay Minerals Inc.</H3><P>Three challenging aspects are:</P><OL><LI>Developing practical and objective indicators (&quot;metrics&quot; - although not necessarily quantitative) to measure progress against community / social impact aspects of CSR.</LI><LI>Developing corporate standards that provide sufficiently detailed guidance to ensure projects and operating locations are performing to corporate expectations and objectives, while providing sufficient flexibility to each location to optimize programs to meet local priorities and social context.   </LI><LI>Integrating CSR programs and objectives into overall operations and management responsibilities in ways that the CSR programs reflect a strategic approach ensuring value for the company and local communities.</LI></OL><H3>MBAC Fertilizer Corp.</H3><P>The biggest challenge relates to the remote location of the project, where the region's population and mostly local workers do not have experience in mining and industrial operation. Awareness, understanding and capacity building in CSR culture require more effort and time than usual.</P><H3>Nortec Minerals Corp.</H3><P>Modifying CSR Practices to fit foreign requirements is a challenge. </P><H3>NOVAGOLD Resources Inc.</H3><P>In Alaska, our region is a very large area with many different and varied communities and social challenges. Just tracking our CSR performance and maintaining engagement throughout this remote area is a significant challenge.</P><H3>Stans Energy Corp.</H3><P>The challenges remained communicating and dealing with local organizations and a dysfunctional government enmeshed in local and somewhat chaotic political issues. This is not to delve further into what is largely a traditionally tribal governing system which is trying to transition to a parliamentary democratic system.</P><H3>Suncor Energy Inc.</H3><P>Although we have come quite far on our CSR journey, some of the most challenging aspects of planning for CSR practices include changing regulatory landscape, shifting attitudes toward our industry and evolving stakeholder perceptions, and geopolitical impacts on global markets. Some of the most challenging aspects of applying CSR practices include being able to fully integrate those practices throughout the company's processes, embedding those practices within the company's culture, and resource constraints.</P><H3>Unigold Inc.</H3><P>The company identified needing to overcome “old school” perceptions with capital investors (non-IFC) that CSR is a socialist activity.</P><H3>U.S. Oil Sands Inc.</H3><P>Ensuring that the CSR culture is maintained as the company grows is a challenge.</P><H3>Other Practices</H3><P>A company indicated that the most challenging aspect of planning for and applying CSR practices is operating in different countries, jurisdictions and cultures.</P><P>A company indicated that the most challenging issue is to be responsible, and to develop mutual respect and trust so that an affected community and all its members become confidently aware of the opportunities that come with mine development, and to bring on development with a sensitivity that allows these individuals to understand, participate, grow, and achieve their own full potential.</P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></SECTION></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

But I stand with the International Monetary Fund, Canadian and global business groups, and aboriginal organizations who say that the CIB, if well structured, is exactly what Canada needs to grow the economy over the long term. Bold action is needed to address an area that we've been failing at: constructing strategic, nation-building infrastructure.</P><P class=""c-article-body__text"">Many of you are probably reading this on a digital device connected to wireless high-speed Internet. And I'll assume that many of you are reading this at work, a place that you travelled to on roads, and that is powered by the electrical grid. Pretty mundane stuff, right? But it's not if you're living or working in remote and northern areas of Canada.</P><DIV class=""u-wrapper pb-feature pb-layout-item pb-f-commercial-dfp-ads"" id=""""><DIV class=""""><DIV id=""c-ad--flex-gpt-1"" class=""c-ad c-ad--inline c-ad--flex""><DIV class=""c-ad__wrapper""><P class=""c-ad__message"">Story continues below advertisement</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P class=""c-article-body__text"">I should know. I represent a major Canadian industry whose opportunities for growth are increasingly in areas where infrastructure simply does not exist, or is severely lacking. As a direct result of this lack of infrastructure – power, ports, roads, telecommunications, you name it – it costs up to six times more to explore for minerals and metals in remote and northern Canada, and more than double to build and operate a mine in these regions compared with more southern areas of the country.</P><P class=""c-article-body__text"">The mining industry, therefore, is a good case study on why the CIB needs to be established.</P><P class=""c-article-body__text"">Let's look at the example of Agnico Eagle Mine Ltd.'s Meadowbank gold mine, which has transformed Nunavut's economy. The mine represents 15 per cent of the territory's GDP, directly employs 300 Inuit employees at an average wage of $107,000 a year, and generates $280-million annually in local business procurement. The company also invests strongly in aboriginal skills training initiatives at more than $5-million a year.</P><P class=""c-article-body__text"">All of these benefits have been generated, despite the fact that the mine – after seven years of operation – has not been profitable. How could this be? Having to absorb the complete cost of basic infrastructure such as roads – in this case a 110-kilometre road – on top of the capital cost to build the mine and related infrastructure, is becoming a deterrent to more investment in Canada's North from the mining sector. You can find similar examples throughout the country.</P><P class=""c-article-body__text"">What's problematic is the lack of infrastructure is increasingly halting promising projects from ever becoming producing mines. This means lost jobs, revenues and other socio-economic benefits to local communities and Canadian governments alike. It also threatens the mining industry's ability to continue being the largest private sector driver in Canada's North. This is a cause for concern, not only for our industry, but also for communities that depend on us. By funding northern infrastructure projects, the CIB can unlock billions of dollars of economic development, can create shared benefits for companies and communities that will use that infrastructure, and could incent future <mark>sustainable</mark> mineral development in the region.</P><P class=""c-article-body__text"">There's really no need for trepidation with the CIB. Canada is just catching up to what other countries are already doing. Look no further than the United States to find the Alaska Industrial and Development Export Authority (AIDEA), a similar institution that for decades has been operating profitably. AIDEA received initial government funding, but is now self-funded and holds $1.3-billion (U.S.) in assets.</P><P class=""c-article-body__text"">AIDEA funded an 85-kilometre road and port facility that enabled one of the world's largest zinc mines to be built. The Red Dog mine, jointly owned by Canada's Teck Resources Ltd. and the NANA Regional Corporation, owned by the Inupiat people of northwest Alaska, serves as an indicator of what the CIB could do in Canada. Through private-public infrastructure investments, MMG Ltd.'s Izok Lake zinc/copper project in Nunavut can be the next Red Dog if a road and port get built. It could help finance run-of-river hydro in Nunavut and take mines and communities off diesel. And we already know how helpful a road would be to Ontario's Ring of Fire region.</P><DIV class=""u-wrapper pb-feature pb-layout-item pb-f-commercial-dfp-ads"" id=""""><DIV class=""""><DIV id=""c-ad--flex-gpt-2"" class=""c-ad c-ad--inline c-ad--flex""><DIV class=""c-ad__wrapper""><P class=""c-ad__message"">Story continues below advertisement</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""js-ad-slimcut-wrapper"" class=""c-ad c-ad--slimcut u-hidden""><DIV class=""c-ad__wrapper"" aria-hidden=""true""><P class=""c-ad__message"">Story continues below advertisement</P></DIV></DIV><P class=""c-article-body__text"">Infrastructure is the key to many things Canadians care about.

He died as a result of complications related to surgery for lung cancer.</P><P>Pootoogook was born at a traditional Inuit camp called Ikerrasak or Ikirasak, near Cape Dorset, Nunavut (then in the Northwest Territories) to Josephie Pootoogook, leader of the camp, and Sarah Ninegeokuluk. The family lived a traditional lifestyle hunting and trapping while living in an iglu in the winter and a sod house in the summer and did not move into their first southern style house until 1942. In 1957 Pootoogook married Shooyoo, moved to Cape Dorset and began work for James Houston.</P><FIGURE class=""pull-left mrgn-rght-sm""><FIGCAPTION class=""small mrgn-bttm-lg"">Photo: Kananginak Pootoogook print</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Originally, Pootoogook did some carving, made prints and lithographs for other artists. At the same time he was a leader in setting up the West Baffin Eskimo Co-operative, the first Inuit owned co-op, now part of the Arctic Co-operatives Limited and served from 1959 until 1964 as the president. Although Kananginak had worked with his father, Josephie, in 1959, it was not until the 1970s that Kananginak began work as a full time artist producing drawings, carvings and prints. According to Terry Ryan, former Co-op manager, Pootoogook was both influenced by and an admirer of the works of his uncle, photographer and historian Peter Pitseolak.</P><P>The World Wildlife Commission released a limited edition set in 1977 that included four of Pootoogook's images and in 1980 he was elected to the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. In 1997 Pootoogook built a 6 ft (1.8 m) inukshuk in Cape Dorset for former Governor General of Canada, Roméo LeBlanc. The inukshuk was dismantled and shipped to Ottawa and with the assistance of his son, Johnny, it was rebuilt at Rideau Hall and unveiled on 21 June, National Aboriginal Day.</P><P>While working on his final, and unfinished, drawing of a Peterhead owned by his father, he was struck by coughing spells, which he declared was cancer.

This Annual Report covers the period April 1, 2010 to March 31, 2011.</P><P>To prepare the report, information was obtained from Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, the federal and territorial governments, and the various implementing bodies established under the Agreement, including the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board, Nunavut Water Board, Nunavut Impact Review Board, and the Nunavut Planning Commission.

Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated</H2><SECTION><H3 id=""chp1-1"">1.1 Overview</H3><P>In its contributions to successive Nunavut Implementation Panel Annual Reports for periods beginning in 2006, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated (<ABBR title=""Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated"">NTI</ABBR>) has emphasized the central and critical importance of its far-reaching implementation lawsuit brought against the Crown at the end of 2006. The <ABBR title=""Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated"">NTI</ABBR> contribution to the 2008-2010 Nunavut Implementation Panel Annual Report summarized the matter this way:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>...the number, breadth, and severity of implementation breaches of the <ABBR title=""Nunavut Land Claims Agreement"">NLCA</ABBR> by the Crown resulted in <ABBR title=""Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated"">NTI</ABBR> bringing, at the end of 2006, a multi-faceted lawsuit against the Attorney General of Canada as the Crown's representative. <ABBR title=""Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated"">NTI</ABBR> had no practical alternative to commencing the lawsuit as the federal government:</P><OL class=""lst-spcd""><LI>Had withdrawn from negotiations to update the implementation contract in 2004 and refused to return to negotiations;  </LI><LI>Rejected 17 offers by <ABBR title=""Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated"">NTI</ABBR> to refer specific issues to arbitration; and,</LI><LI>Would not accept the key recommendations of Conciliator Tom Berger's final conciliation report.</LI></OL><P>In the two-year period covered by the 2008-2010 NIP Report, the federal government remained inflexible in relation to these three possibilities. Accordingly, the critical <ABBR title=""Nunavut Land Claims Agreement"">NLCA</ABBR> implementation activities in the 2008-2010 period revolved around the early stages of the prosecution of the <ABBR title=""Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated"">NTI</ABBR> lawsuit.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>April 1, 2010, to March 31, 2011 – the period covered by this Annual Report – did not witness any greater receptiveness by the federal government to these three possibilities, or any other concerted effort to resolve the underlying issues that brought about the lawsuit. Accordingly, the lawsuit remains the &quot;elephant in the <ABBR title=""Nunavut Land Claims Agreement"">NLCA</ABBR> implementation room&quot; – that is, it remains the main determinant of whether, when, and how key parts of the <ABBR title=""Nunavut Land Claims Agreement"">NLCA</ABBR> will be implemented, and what broader policy and legal consequences will ensue.</P><P>Readers of this Annual Report are invited to acquaint themselves with the set of Questions and Answers about the lawsuit set out in the <ABBR title=""Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated"">NTI</ABBR> contribution to the 2008-2010 Annual Report.</P><P><ABBR title=""Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated"">NTI</ABBR> was happy with the procedural and logistical progress made in the lawsuit in the 2010-2011 time frame.</P><P>Without diminishing the central importance of the lawsuit, the balance of this <ABBR title=""Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated"">NTI</ABBR> contribution to this Annual Report provides information about activities carried out by <ABBR title=""Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated"">NTI</ABBR> in relation to implementation of the <ABBR title=""Nunavut Land Claims Agreement"">NLCA</ABBR>, and some wider Inuit issues and priorities. It should be pointed out that many of these activities were accompanied by parallel and complementary activities on the part of the three regional Inuit associations within Nunavut.</P></SECTION><SECTION><H3 id=""chp1-2"">1.2 Specific Implementation Related Activities</H3><SECTION><H4 id=""chp1-2-1"">Building Understanding of the <ABBR title=""Nunavut Land Claims Agreement"">NLCA</ABBR></H4><P>In the course of the year, a number of presentations were made on the negotiation and implementation of the <ABBR title=""Nunavut Land Claims Agreement"">NLCA</ABBR>.

Raymond Ningeocheak, <ABBR title=""Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated"">NTI</ABBR>'s former Vice-President of Finance, gave a presentation to the House of Commons Standing Committee on Natural Resources advising that <ABBR title=""Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated"">NTI</ABBR>'s position is that offshore oil and gas drilling should not proceed without assured environmental protection. The National Energy Board also announced a public review of offshore Arctic drilling requirements. <ABBR title=""Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated"">NTI</ABBR> forwarded comments to the Board's secretary regarding the scope of this review, indicating the need for the review to examine infrastructure and training requirements, response time in relation to possible oil spills and discharges, and protection of the Arctic marine habitat and species.</P></SECTION><SECTION><H4 id=""chp1-2-6"">Nunavut Marine Council</H4><P><ABBR title=""Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated"">NTI</ABBR> hosted a Nunavut Marine Council workshop in Iqaluit, in May 2010.

For any future comprehensive review to be successful, the data deficiency problem requires a solution. It was impossible to substantiate any possible positive or negative impacts to Inuit or Nunavut firms if changes were made to the current bid adjustment breakdown of 21 per cent – or more specifically, 7 per cent for Inuit firms, 7 per cent for Nunavut businesses, and the additional 7 per cent for local businesses.</P><P>The report had four key recommendations:</P><OL class=""lst-spcd""><LI>That the review committee identifies and review specific areas of data deficiencies and produce recommendations to address the difficulties that currently exist in collecting and utilizing <ABBR title=""Government of Nunavut"">GN</ABBR> contracting information.</LI><LI>That the review committee conducts an audit on the implementation of the <ABBR title=""Nunavummi Nangminiqaqtunik Ikajuuti"">NNI</ABBR> Policy with regard to <ABBR title=""Government of Nunavut"">GN</ABBR> contracting.</LI><LI>That the terms of reference for the review committee reflect changes to the reporting requirements and committee composition.

National, regional and local bodies, such as offshore and land management regimes, must be designed and operated to be effective, transparent and accountable, thereby gaining and sustaining the confidence of the Inuit public at all times.</P><P>7.6 Sustainability standards must emphasize the need for the demonstrated support of those communities directly affected by a resource development proposal.</P></SECTION><SECTION><H4>8. Impact Assessment, Prevention and Mitigation</H4><P>8.1 Notwithstanding property rights or government rights-granting regimes, there is no free-standing or unqualified &quot;right&quot; to proceed with non-renewable resource development in <EM>Inuit Nunaat</EM>. Projects must be scrutinized byInuit and proved to be in the best interests of Inuit and the wider public.</P><P>8.2 Land and offshore management regimes must include (a) long-term land use plans that set out ground rules for development applicable to specific projects, and (b) robust impact assessment processes to gauge the likely impacts of specific projects.</P><P>8.3 Management, land use planning and impact assessment regimes must address the cumulative impacts of existing and potential projects and, where prudent, limit the number and scope of projects permitted.</P><P>8.4 Impact assessments covering broad geographic areas are important and necessary management tools, and their completion in advance of specific project proposals should be encouraged.</P><P>8.5 Impact assessments should examine all potential environmental, socio-economic and cultural impacts anticipated both during the project and after the project is completed or abandoned.</P><P>8.6 In accordance with relevant provisions of the <EM>Rio Declaration on Environment and Development</EM>, the precautionary principle and thepolluter pays principle must be applied in all stages of project planning, assessment, implementation and reclamation.</P><P>8.7 Reclamation and recovery of habitat and affected lands and waters must be thoroughly planned and fully funded in advance of and throughout project implementation.</P><P>8.8 All development in <EM>Inuit Nunaat</EM> must adhere to the most developed and demanding environmental standards ta king Arctic conditions fully into account. (For example, mining operations and offshore hydro-<mark>carbon</mark> development should entail zero-volume discharge onto land and into Arctic waters.)</P><P>8.9 Preventing spills offshore and eliminating release of toxic substances to land and waters are paramount. Prevention efforts should be viewed as investments that pay dividends in cost avoidance.</P><P>8.10 Response to spills, contamination of lands or waters, and mining emergencies must meet the highest technological standards and be anchored in proven cleanup technologies with full Inuit participation.</P><P>8.11 Proposals for spill response in Arctic waters must include a proven demonstration of the industry's ability to retrieve spilled oil in frozen, broken and refreezing ice conditions. Allowing resource development without such a demonstration would be fundamentally irresponsible.</P><P>8.12 Effective oil spill prevention and response in Arctic waters requires active monitoring of vessel traffic and swift and effective emergency response in the event of mishap. Public authorities and developers with relevant responsibilities must commit to increased investment in navigation aids, vessel traffic management, ship compliance inspections, security considerations, emergency response capability, and overall port and harbour infrastructure.</P><P>8.13 Standards and requirements for Arctic marine pilots must be carefully conceived and strictly applied.</P><P>8.14 An international liability and compensation regime for contamination of lands, waters and marine areas resulting from offshore oil exploration and exploitation must be established.</P><P>8.15 Respecting the Arctic Council's &quot;Arctic Offshore Oil and Gas Guidelines&quot; as minimum standards.</P></SECTION><SECTION><H4>9. Improving Inuit Living Standards and Expanding Inuit Governance</H4><P>9.1 Inuit expect that new resource development projects will contribute to an improvement in our material well-being. This expectation is well-rooted in the fundamental features of relevant international indigenous and human rights laws and standards, in the underlying constitutional constructs and political values of the four Arctic States in which Inuit live, and in the application of fairness and reason.</P><P>9.2 Through a variety of mechanisms – land rights settlement legislation, land claims agreements (treaties), self-government arrangements, and intergovernmental and Constitutional provisions – Inuit have acquired critical means and levels of control over the governance of <EM>Inuit Nunaat</EM>. Many of these mechanisms provide for direct Inuit participation in specialized resource management bodies, including planning, project review, and regulatory bodies.</P><P>9.3 While this trend is primarily a result of Inuit effort and determination, it has often been assisted and welcomed as healthy and normative by and within the four Arctic States.</P><P>9.4 Accordingly, resource development projects must take into account the trend toward greater Inuit self-governance and, to the extent possible, advance it.</P><P>9.5 Public sector revenues derived from all phases of resource development should be distributed in a fair and visible way according to the following hierarchy of priorities: (1) providing security against unplanned or unintended environmental consequences, (2) compensating for negative community and regional impacts, (3) contributing to the improvement of community and regional living standards and overall well-being, and (4) contributing to the fiscal health and stability of institutions and mechanisms of Inuit governance. Only after the legitimate needs of the Inuit of <EM>Inuit Nunaat</EM> are met, should public sector revenues contribute to the coffers of central State treasuries.</P><P>9.6 Inuit employment at all levels must be maximized in resource development activities in <EM>Inuit Nunaat</EM>.</P><P>9.7 Independent of the rate of resource development, Inuit must derive direct and substantial employment income benefit from resource development projects. Accordingly, an Inuit education fund should be established in each of Canada, Greenland, Russia and the U.S.A. with public sector investments.</P></SECTION><SECTION><H4>10. Promoting and Accommodating a Dynamic Inuit Culture</H4><P>10.1 Many international law principles and standards in relation to indigenous peoples are rooted in the b conviction that the development and preservation of human cultural diversity is both a responsibility and a benefit for all humanity. The <EM>UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples </EM>acknowledges thatindigenous peoples have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their language, traditional knowledge and cultural heritage and expressions.</P><P>10.2 Inuit culture is both well-rooted and dynamic. Inuit are committed to ensuring that resource development projects must be planned and implemented in such a way as to support and enhance Inuit culture, rather than subvert or overwhelm it.</P><P>10.3 Inuit are committed to safe-guarding Inuit culture against excess adverse pressures and impacts that could be brought on by an overly ambitious, ill timed, or poorly planned and implemented staging of major resource development projects, particularly insofar as such a scenario precipitated a major influx of non-Inuit while failing to impart the technologies, skills and training, and business opportunities needed by Inuit.</P><P>10.4 Governments, public bodies and private sector actors in <EM>Inuit Nunaat</EM> must share in these commitments.</P><P><B>We, the Inuit of <EM>Inuit Nunaat</EM>, are committed to the principles on resource development in <EM>Inuit Nunaat</EM> set out in this Declaration. Inuit invite –and are entitled to expect – all those who have or seek a role in the governance, management, development, or use of the resources of <EM>Inuit Nunaat </EM>to conduct themselves with inthe letter and spirit of this Declaration.</B></P></SECTION></SECTION></SECTION></MAIN></BODY></HTML>"

The only inland
community in Nunavut, it is located west of Hudson Bay, near the
geographic centre of Canada. Its Inuktitut name is Qamani’tuaq
(“where the river widens”). Baker Lake is in what is referred
to today as the Kivalliq region, but was formerly called the
Keewatin. Next to the local high school, there is a sign boasting
that Baker Lake is the “Mining Capital of the Keewatin.” Indeed,
Baker Lake is home to Nunavut’s only currently operating mine,
the Meadowbank gold mine owned by Agnico-Eagle Mines.</P><H3>Inuit Resistance to Uranium Mining</H3><P>Since the late 1960s, Inuit in Baker Lake have been
contending with uranium exploration, and the possibility
of uranium mining, near their community.
After more than three decades of resistance to uranium
exploration and mining proposals, Baker Lake
is faced with a proposal by the French state-owned
multinational AREVA to construct a uranium mine
called Kiggavik (falcon). The Kiggavik mine would be
located 80 kilometres west of Baker Lake, upstream
from the community’s water supply and in sensitive
caribou habitat. If built, it would be the first uranium
mine to be opened in Nunavut, and the first uranium
mine anywhere to be operated in an environment of
continuous permafrost. AREVA’s proposal, and uranium
mining in general, is generating a great deal of
controversy throughout Nunavut.</P><P>A number of interesting political developments
have brought this controversy to the forefront of Nunavut’s
political discourse. Inuit concern over frenzied
exploration for uranium in the early 1970s led to an
important court case which helped set the stage for
negotiation of the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement
and the creation of Nunavut. In the late 1980s a German-
led proposal to exploit the Kiggavik ore body was
defeated by a determined coalition of community
and regional groups. In a municipal plebiscite held
in Baker Lake in March 1990, 90.2 percent of the voters
opposed Kiggavik. During these struggles, Inuit
in Baker Lake had the support of virtually all relevant
Inuit organizations that existed at the time.</P><H3>The Nuclear PR Offensive</H3><P>By 2006, AREVA had acquired the rights to the Kiggavik
ore body and began an intensive public relations
campaign. A local public relations office was opened
in the community, and AREVA began “consulting”
with the community through monthly “community
liaison committee” meetings and semi-regular community
“open houses.” These open houses involve
numerous industry experts, well-versed in various
pro-nuclear talking points. Claims, which are controversial
at best, are regularly made regarding the
ability of nuclear energy to solve <mark>climate change</mark>, the
ability of uranium to contribute to cancer research,
and the recent technical progress which has ensured that uranium mining poses absolutely no threat to
environmental or community health. These open
houses, along with AREVA’s campaign in general,
involve a number of prizes and gifts: free hats, free
t-shirts, free fuel for hunting, and, most importantly,
free trips for Elders to their homelands in AREVA’s
exploration helicopter.</P><P>In 2007, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. (NTI), the land
claim corporation that represents all Nunavut Inuit,
reversed its stance on uranium, adopting a new policy
that supports “<mark>sustainable</mark>” uranium mining. The
Government of Nunavut (GN), the public government
that represents all residents of Nunavut, quickly followed
suit and issued a similar policy. Both decisions
were made with minimal public consultation, despite
the fact that the 1997 Keewatin Regional Land Use
Plan stipulated that “Any future proposal to mine uranium
must be approved by the people of the region.”</P><P>After these policies were adopted, the Kivalliq Inuit
Association (KIA), the regional Inuit association that
has a complicated relationship with NTI, began holding
consultation meetings about uranium mining with
communities in the Kivalliq. These meetings mostly
consisted of Qallunaat (non-Inuit) bureaucrats using
materials prepared by AREVA to give long presentations
that explained how great uranium mining would
be for the region. Numerous industry experts employed
by AREVA were present to “answer questions.” Significantly,
no one with expert credentials who was critical
of AREVA’s proposal was invited to attend.</P><P>In 2008 AREVA submitted their Kiggavik proposal
to the Nunavut Impact Review Board (NIRB). If
approved, the Kiggavik mine would consist of four
open-pit and one underground mine. Furthermore,
AREVA’s explicit intent is to put in place the infrastructure
required to make increasing the number
of uranium mines in the area economically feasible.</P><H3>Public Responses: Mixed and conflicted</H3><P>Public reaction to these developments has been
mixed, and highly conflicted. Many Inuit in Baker
Lake are excited about the employment opportunities
AREVA is promising. On their website AREVA claims
that 50 percent of their workforce will be made up of
Inuit from the region. In a community coping with the
trauma of colonial administration (especially relocations,
colonial schooling and paternalistic administration),
promises of prosperity and self-esteem through
wage employment are attractive, to say the least.
That being said, Baker Lake is no longer the desperately
poor community it once was. One medium-sized
gold mine, Meadowbank, has tapped out the community’s
labour force, requiring Agnico to fly Inuit workers
in from other communities to meet their regional
employment promises.</P><P>Others are less sympathetic to AREVA’s plans, and
extremely frustrated with territorial governance
structures decision to support uranium mining with
such limited public input. Many of the Inuit I spoke
with distrust AREVA’s promises of employment and
are alarmed by the potential impacts of the Kiggavik
proposal.</P><P>The experience with the Meadowbank gold mine has
left some local Inuit with a sour taste in their mouths.
While everyone I have spoken with seems happy that
new jobs are available near town, many seemed
upset with the conditions Inuit are subjected to at
the mine. Complaints include a hostile work environment,
a racially stratified workforce, racist treatment
by coworkers, sexual harassment, issues surrounding
the use of Inuktitut in the workplace and an alarmingly
high turnover rate among Inuit employees.</P><P>During an interview, Baker Lake Elder Julie Tuluqtuq
commented that “there were a lot of expectations
a lot of the Elders had about what kind of work
was going to go on at Agnico and how much employment
the locals would get, and we never expected all
these conflicts like people quitting and getting fired
and stuff like that. There’s no harmony over there
and that’s not what we expected.” She later added,
“The way Inuit are treated up there, they’re basically
treated like slaves by their supervisors and they’re
made to work like dogs. The bosses are really proud
and they’re hard to deal with.” These issues have
some Inuit questioning whether or not another mine
could actually provide more meaningful employment
for the community.</P><P>Other frustrations with Meadowbank stem from
a lack of local control over the mine now that it is in
operation. Many are upset with the long struggle the
community had to wage to gain access to the road to
the Meadowbank mine. Some also feel their concerns
about the need to mitigate the amount of dust the
mine road produces, and the need to alter sections of
the road to facilitate snowmobile crossing, are being
ignored. One Elder commented that whenever hunters
and Elders ask Agnico to address their concerns,
“they always tell us how much money these things
would cost… but they are forgetting that they are
destroying our land to take money out of the ground.”
Some people in the community have expressed
anxiety that similar issues would arise if the Kiggavik
proposal comes to fruition. A letter from the Baker
Lake Hunters and Trappers Organization to the NIRB
quoted a local Elder who said, “Under the Nunavut
agreement, we were told we would be able to take
part in the process… We were supposed to have some
input in the process, our concerns were supposed to be heard and voiced and they would be used… But as
soon as we got our Nunavut agreement signed, it’s
like all these…Agnico and AREVA… as soon as that
agreement was signed they just started going fullblast
into full swing and they seem to be just skipping
processes and going right ahead with opening
mines and making roads and our concerns seem to
be sidestepped… and it’s just like an afterthought.”</P><P>Locals have other concerns with AREVA’s proposal
that are related to Kiggavik’s potential impacts on the
environment and community health. Among these
concerns, potential contamination of wildlife (especially
caribou, fox, wolf, wolverine, muskoxen and
fish), potential disturbance to wildlife and potential
contamination of drinking water are most prominent.
During an interview, Baker Lake Elder John Killulark
said, “I’m scared of Kiggavik. It’s really close to our
water supply. It’s close to the Thelon River, which
flows into Baker Lake. Uranium is being exposed to the environment and once it’s exposed to the environment
it might go into the streams that go into the
rivers that go into Baker Lake.” In another interview,
Elder Paul Atutuva said, “The concern I have is that
any of the wildlife… if they might eventually consume
any contaminants and become contaminated themselves
and unsafe for human consumption.”</P><P>For many Inuit in Baker Lake, concerns about environmental
and health impacts are about more than
the specific Kiggavik proposal. “AREVA has made it
clear that their intent is to open the region, and the
territory, to as much uranium mining as possible. If
we open this door we can never close it again,” Baker
Lake hunter Joan Scottie said. “How many mines do
we need? How much money do we need? How much
impact can the caribou withstand?”</P><P>As a result of these concerns, many Inuit are
angry with the GN and NTI for adopting pro-uranium
stances without community input. Some have also
criticized the manner in which the conditions of the
Regional Land Use Plan were deemed to have been
satisfied, based on Hamlet Council and Inuit Organization
resolutions of support rather than a public
plebiscite. The fact that this took place despite the
long history of fierce opposition to uranium mining
in Baker Lake has left many Inuit furious with their
governing institutions.</P><P>Many Inuit are also frustrated with their Inuit
organizations for not engaging with critical experts
when they developed their policies or when they held
community consultation meetings. Some residents
complained that it is incredibly difficult to voice opposition
when they are forced to contend with professional
public relations personnel, armed with an endless
supply of pro-nuclear talking points. One Elder
complained, “They keep telling you these good stories
of products in your own home… As an example, TV
gives off radiation or is made from some sort of radioactive
material… so is your microwave, so is the clock.
They say, ‘If that’s safe, why shouldn’t our products
be safe?’ Obviously it is hard to answer back when
you are told that your TV produces radioactivity. They
give you that answer and it is hard to really talk back.
It gets to the point where there may be issues that
might come up, but given that type of answer it is
difficult to try and talk back. You may have concerns,
but how do you explain what your concerns might be
given the type of answers you are given?”</P><H3>Organizing opposition</H3><P>Nunavummiut Makitagunarningit (“the people
of Nunavut can rise up”), or Makita, was formed
by some residents of Baker Lake and Iqaluit as a
response to this situation. Makita is a non-governmental
organization with the goal of fostering public
debate about uranium mining in Nunavut. Two veteran
anti-uranium-mining activists, Joan Scottie of
Baker Lake and Jack Hicks of Iqaluit, helped form the
group. They were joined by a new generation of activists,
most notably the articulate young Iqaluit lawyer
Sandra Inutiq.</P><P>In the early summer of 2010, Makita submitted a
petition to the GN, requesting a public inquiry into the
issue of uranium mining in Nunavut. The group argued
that a public inquiry would be “more transparent, flexible
and democratic than a regulatory process,” and
that a public inquiry would help residents of the territory
deal with the regulatory and policy decisions that
were being made without their participation. Additionally,
they suggested that a public inquiry would
help the territory properly determine whether or not
governing bodies are capable of properly monitoring
uranium mining, enforcing regulations and responding
to uranium-related accidents in Nunavut.</P><P>The GN responded in August 2010 by denying the
request for a public inquiry, instead launching a “public
forum” process on uranium mining. These public
forums consisted of a series of public meetings in
Baker Lake, Iqaluit and Cambridge Bay in the winter/
spring of 2011.</P><P>Makita criticized the GN’s choice to hold public
forums rather than an inquiry, stating that the “process
proposed is window dressing. Public meetings
without a mandate for research and reporting, and
without clear standards for transparency or process,
will be a waste of time and money.” Furthermore, the
background information on uranium the GN commissioned
for the public forums was criticized by Makita
and Mining Watch Canada as factually inaccurate and
clearly biased in favour of the nuclear industry.</P><P>On the heels of the GN’s public forums, NTI President
Cathy Towtongie announced that her organization
would also review its uranium policy. Towtongie
made this announcement at a leaders’ summit of the
Inuit Circumpolar Council in February 2011. Tension
within the organization resulted in a media release
qualifying this call for a review, stipulating that NTI
would “take into account existing legal obligations.”
(NTI has been “given” shares in companies exploring
the region for uranium.) NTI’s review is scheduled to
begin once the GN concludes its public forum process.
Meanwhile, the NIRB’s review of AREVA’s Kiggavik
proposal has continued, with more than a little controversy.</P><P>The amount of intervener funding provided
to interested parties by the Federal Department of
Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development is quite
small, and divided between numerous groups. As it
stands, no groups will have enough funding to under take a comprehensive review of AREVA’s Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS).</P><P>Serious concerns have also been brought up regarding
the lack of translation into Inuktitut of important
documents. The review board’s guidelines for
AREVA’s EIS were only made available in English. In
response, both Makita and the Baker Lake Hunters
and Trappers Organization requested that the review
process be put on hold until the guidelines could be
properly translated into Inuktitut. The NIRB denied
their requests on the grounds that technical concepts
could not be translated.</P><P>Eugene Niviatsiaq, a board member of the Hunters
and Trappers Organization, told an NIRB meeting
that “NIRB has failed us. You have failed hunters
and Elders who only speak, read and write Inuktitut.”
Niviatsiaq noted that uranium mining was first proposed
for the Kivalliq region in the late 1980s. “Uranium-related
words should have been translated a long time ago.”
Makita’s Joan Scottie also criticized the NIRB’s decision:
“How are unilingual Inuktitut-speaking hunters
in Baker Lake and other Kivalliq communities, the
people with probably the most to lose if the region is
open to uranium mining, supposed to understand and
take part in the review process if they are prevented
from reading the most important document that the
NIRB has to produce?”</P><P>The EIS guidelines have also been criticized by
Makita for their inattention to cumulative impacts
(especially the potential spin-off projects that Kiggavik
will likely engender) and by Pauktuutit Inuit Women of
Canada (the national Inuit women’s organization) for
their lack of attention to Inuit women’s issues.</P><P>Some Inuit have complained that they have no way
of knowing whether or not the concerns they voice
during consultation meetings are being addressed,
because actual decisions are made by a complex and
highly technical bureaucratic structure that operates
in a language many of them do not speak. This has
left many feeling highly apathetic towards the review
process. An Elder in Baker Lake complained, “People
have been coming up here for years and years asking
all kinds of questions and at times it’s like we’re just
speaking into the air and nothing ever gets done.” In
an interview, Baker Lake Elder John Killulark asserted
that he did not like the idea of having a uranium mine
located close to his source of food and water, but that
“in Baker Lake we have no powers to [object]…we
have no course of action…nowhere to say anything.”</P><H3>Tied up in process</H3><P>For the moment, Makita and other concerned Nunavummiut
must sit and wait. AREVA’s EIS is due to
be released in January 2012, after which Makita, the
Hunters and Trappers Organization, Inuit organizations
and other concerned parties will have to find a
way to use their minimal financial resources to analyze
and critique a massive compendium of highly
technical documents. The results of the GN’s public
forum process, as well as NTI’s policy review, have
not yet been released.</P><P>The decision whether to approve Kiggavik and open
the Kivalliq region — and Nunavut as a whole — to
uranium mining ultimately rests in the hands of
elected Inuit politicians. Makita organizer Jack Hicks
notes that “if uranium mining is approved in Nunavut,
it will be because the institutions established
as a result of the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement
made it possible. The Nunavut land claim process was
kick-started by exploration for uranium in the Kivalliq,
but it’s not impossible that the post-land-claim Inuit
leadership ends up in bed with the nuclear industry.”
Watching the GN and NTI carefully will be Nunavut’s
only environmental NGO, Nunavummiut Makitagunarningit.
“By omitting vital sustainability issues
at a time when the Arctic’s ecosystem is undergoing
monumental challenges,” Makita chairperson Sandra
Inutiq told the first GN public forum, “we risk deepening
the issues of health impacts, social impacts,
impacts on the ecosystem of mining. We should learn
from what is going on in the world just as the hunter
learns by reading the conditions of the elements
around him. We are losing our moral compass if we
go blindly into this storm.”</P><P>Makita continues to call for a public vote on the
question of uranium mining in Nunavut: “A democratic
vote is the only way to know for sure how people
feel — no corporate spin or backroom deals, just
you, your conscience, and a ballot.”</P><P><EM>Warren Bernauer is a PhD Student at York University, where he studies the politics of uranium mining in Nunavut.</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>"

Gold royalties earned from the Canadian Malartic mine decreased by 3% or 975 ounces (sales decreased by 972 ounces), but the decrease from the Canadian Malartic mine was more than offset by the gold royalties earned from the Éléonore, Island Gold and Vezza net smelter return (“NSR”) royalties. The Company earned and sold 6,568 ounces of gold from the Éléonore mine compared to 402 ounces in 2015. In addition, the Company received and sold 1,373 ounces of gold from its Island Gold mine NSR royalty and received 830 ounces of gold from its Vezza NSR royalty and sold 730 ounces of gold. The average selling price of gold per ounce in Canadian dollars was also higher in 2016 at $1,643 compared to $1,486 in 2015.</P><P>In 2016, operating income amounted to $29.1 million compared to $18.2 million in 2015. The increase in net operating income in 2016 is mainly the result of higher revenues generated from the sale of gold and silver, lower business development expenses, a recovery of exploration tax credits of $2.2 million, lower exploration and evaluation expenses and higher cost recoveries from associates, partially offset by the depletion of royalty interests and higher general and administrative expenses (“G&amp;A”). The increase in G&amp;A expenses is mainly due to higher legal costs and costs related to the listing on the NYSE as well as higher share-based compensation expenses and was mostly offset by an increase in cost recoveries from associates The decrease in business development is mainly due to the $2.2 million fees incurred in 2015 for the acquisition of Virginia and the streamlining of operations in 2016.</P><P>The increase in net earnings attributable to Osisko’s shareholders in 2016 is mainly the result of an increase of $10.9 million in operating income and net gains on investments of $30.2 million compared to $1.6 million in 2015, partially offset by a loss on foreign exchange of $5.8 million compared to a gain of $11.1 million in 2015, higher finance costs, higher share of loss of associates, higher income tax expense and lower interest and dividend income. Dividend income decreased as a result of the sale of the investment in LIORC in the fourth quarter of 2016. </P><P>The increase of $5.2 million in adjusted earnings in 2016 compared to 2015 is mainly due to an increase in operating income of $10.9 million, partially offset by lower interest and dividend revenues of $1.7 million, higher finance costs of $2.8 million and current income taxes of $1.3 million.

(the “Partners”). At Canadian Malartic, guidance for 2017 and 2018 has been slightly increased due to a change in the life-of-mine plan. The Partners indicated that the updated plan provides for earlier access to higher grade zones that are located deeper in the Canadian Malartic pit. The Partnership is currently forecasting 600,000 ounces, 650,000 ounces and 640,000 ounces of gold production for 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively<SUP>3</SUP>. </P><P>Following the Québec Bureau des Audiences Publiques sur l’Environnement (“BAPE”) public hearings in June and July 2016, permitting of the Canadian Malartic extension project and Highway 117 deviation reached an important milestone with the issue of the BAPE report on October 5, 2016. The BAPE report concluded that the project is acceptable and provides several recommendations intended to enhance social acceptability. Since the spring of 2015, the Partnership has been working collaboratively with the community of Malartic and its citizens to develop a “Good Neighbour Guide” that addresses impacts caused by the activities at the Canadian Malartic mine. Implementation of the recommendations in the Good Neighbour Guide began on September 1, 2016. As of November 30, 2016, which was the end of the claim period for citizens of Malartic to request compensation for the period from June 2013 through June 2016, approximately 94% of Malartic citizens had registered for the program. The next step in the permitting process is for the Minister of <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development, Environment and the Fight against <mark>Climate Change</mark> to review the report and present his decision to Cabinet for approval. No date for the approval has been set, but the Partners anticipate that this may occur in the first half of 2017.

In addition, Osisko will make ongoing payments of US$2.75 ($3.60) per ounce of silver delivered.</P><P>Osisko will receive from Taseko an amount equal to 100% of the Gibco silver production until the delivery of 5.9 million ounces of silver, which is equivalent to Taseko’s 75% share of the silver in the current proven and probable mineral reserves, and 35% of silver production thereafter for the life of mine. Gibraltar is the second largest open pit copper mine in Canada and fourth largest in North America. The life of mine yearly average production from Gibraltar is approximately 140 million pounds (“lbs”) of copper and 2.6 million lbs of molybdenum. With a large mineral reserve of 3.2 billion lbs of recoverable copper and 58 million lbs of molybdenum, the estimated mine life of the project is 23 years (proven and probable mineral reserves as of January 1, 2016). The acquisition is expected to increase Osisko’s production by approximately 200,000 ounces of silver for the next 14 years, increasing to an average of 350,000 ounces of silver for the remainder of the 23-year reserve life of Gibraltar. Any silver in respect of which a delivery is made after January 1, 2017, is subject to the stream.

	What if you could tell before a press release comes out that a company is poised to be bought out, possibly at a nice premium? Sounds good, right? By watching historic patterns, that might just be possible. <I><A href=""http://www.theaureport.com/"" target=""_blank"">The Gold Report</A></I> reached out to experts who have been around through enough cycles to know and asked for the clues they watch that an acquisition might be imminent. From location and early investment to derisking levels, you just have to know what to look for to position yourself for a liquidity event.</P><P>
	There are certain points in market cycles where buyouts just make more sense than in others. Chen Lin, author of the popular stock newsletter<I> What Is Chen Buying? What Is Chen Selling, </I>sees a recent flurry of mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) as an indication that we are, indeed, at the bottom of the gold market and can expect more consolidation—and at a premium. &quot;We saw the start of a new phase of M&amp;A happening when <STRONG>OceanaGold Corp. (OGC:CA)</STRONG> bought <STRONG>Romarco Minerals Inc. (R:CA)</STRONG>, and Romarco shareholders realized a big premium for that,&quot; he says. Add to that <STRONG>First Mining Finance Corp.'s (FF:CA)</STRONG> merger with <STRONG>Gold Canyon Resources Inc. (GCU:CA)</STRONG> and <STRONG>PC Gold Inc. (PKL:CA)</STRONG>. &quot;Investors of those stocks were rewarded handsomely.&quot; He continues, &quot;A lot of companies with good balance sheets will try to take advantage of this downturn to pick up properties at rock bottom prices. This is actually a good time for those companies that can afford to do M&amp;A.&quot;</P><P>
	Lin clarifies that in many cases it is not the majors that are buying. &quot;A lot of the big companies are in deep trouble. Many are selling assets. <STRONG>Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX:CA) (ABX) </STRONG>was buying at the top of the market, and now it's selling at the bottom of the market.&quot; He is focusing on the mid-tiers like <STRONG>Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. (AEM:CA) (AEM)</STRONG>, which teamed with <STRONG>Yamana Gold Inc. (YRI:CA)</STRONG> to buy Osisko Mining Corp. last year. &quot;The pattern I see is that those companies that have good cash flow in a strong financial situation use that to buy other companies to build their assets for the next upturn.&quot;</P><P>
	Bob Moriarty, founder of <I>321gold.com, </I>also observes that the bigger the company, the more it seems to buy at the top. &quot;Barrick Gold, <STRONG>Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM)</STRONG>, <STRONG>Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)</STRONG>, these guys are actually getting rid of assets. I think it's a mistake. They were buying assets at the top and paying too much, now they are selling those same assets at a big discount,&quot; he says. &quot;The smart people are making acquisitions now at the cheapest prices in four years. Assets are basically being given away.&quot;</P><P>
	Moriarty also points to First Mining Finance as an example of a company taking advantage of the deals available right now. &quot;First Mining is led by Keith Neumeyer as chairman, the same guy who started <STRONG>First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM:CA) (FQM:LSE)</STRONG> and <STRONG>First Majestic Silver Corp. (FR:CA) (AG) (FMV:FSE)</STRONG>. He started two billion dollar companies and he is a very bright guy. I think that First Mining is going to be another big success. Neumeyer is doing all stock deals because he's hoarding his cash. He is buying gold for $20 an ounce ($20/oz) for printing up pieces of paper. That is a target that would have cost $100/oz five years ago.&quot;</P><P>
	For another example of a smart mid cap almost stealing a project from a major, Moriarty cites<STRONG> Lundin Gold Inc. (LUG:CA) </STRONG>picking up the $2 billion ($2B) Fruta del Norte in Ecuador for about $300 million ($300M) from <STRONG>Kinross Gold Corp. (K:CA) (KGC)</STRONG>. &quot;The major got rid of it because they just lack the skill set to negotiate with the Ecuador government, which got greedy and wanted way too much money in taxes and essentially killed the project. Rick Rule and Lukas Lundin believe they can make it work and I believe them,&quot; he says.</P><P>
	Joe Mazumdar, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, anticipates an overall increase in M&amp;A for undervalued, quality projects in manageable jurisdictions that are advancing to commercial production; however the timing will be very suitor-specific. &quot;Any potential suitor in the gold mining sector should be looking to fill a need and not a desire as both equity and debt holders remain wary of dilutive M&amp;A and the consequent impairments that represent the vagrancies of the previous cycle. We believe that suitors will be seeking to fill holes in their future production profile with assets that are aligned with their comparative technical advantages in mining, processing or in permitting and financing. The asset location will also be an important factor as manageable jurisdictions will garner premiums in this market,&quot; he says.</P><P>
	As an example, Mazumdar cites the recent acquisition (October 2015) of the permitted, high grade Haile open pit gold project in South Carolina operated by Romarco by OceanaGold (Buy rated by Reg Spencer). &quot;OceanaGold sought a low-cost gold project with a decent production profile, low execution risk (already permitted, in construction) and upside potential (underground).&quot;</P><P>
	Mazumdar adds, &quot;Recent M&amp;A has also been focused on the acquisition of assets divested by major gold producers as they seek to rid themselves of non-core assets to improve their balance sheets. Note the acquisition by OceanaGold in June 2015 of the Waihi gold operation in New Zealand from <STRONG>Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM)</STRONG>, (Not rated). For its part, Newmont Mining divested Waihi but acquired the Cripple Creek gold mine in Colorado sold by <STRONG>AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (AU)</STRONG>, (Not rated). Cripple Creek represented a profitable operation in a stable jurisdiction that Newmont believed it could potentially improve (lower costs and improve recoveries).&quot;</P><P><I>Exploration Insights </I>author Brent Cook sees the $526M Probe Metals acquisition by <STRONG>Goldcorp Inc. (G:CA) (GG)</STRONG> and the $205M Cayden Resources acquisition by Agnico Eagle as flukes. &quot;That those companies paid so much for such early-stage projects was really a surprise. More common today is vulture activity. Most majors have acquired what they could, gotten rid of what they couldn't justify and are focused on trying to survive. Some desperation deals are going on now,&quot; he says. He doesn't anticipate a rush to acquire until gold prices start to increase.</P><P>
	There are exceptions. &quot;Some smart people are consolidating junior resource companies while they are on sale,&quot; Cook says. &quot;<STRONG>Newmarket Gold Inc. (NMI:CA) (NMKTF)</STRONG> recently acquired Australia-based Crocodile Gold in a $190M deal. <STRONG>Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd. (OR:CA)</STRONG> is buying up Canadian explorers by funding <STRONG>Oban Mining Corp. (OBM:CA)</STRONG>. Oban's game plan is to acquire as much prospective ground as possible in anticipation of a gold price increase.&quot;</P><P>
	Cook singles out <STRONG>Premier Gold Mines Ltd. (PG:CA)</STRONG> as another example of smart consolidation. The North American-focused explorer and developer acquired a 40% interest from Barrick Gold in the South Arturo mine project in the Carlin Trend in Nevada in June for $20M and a few other considerations. New guidance of the project in July estimated 2016 gold production at 200,000 oz at an all-in cost of $730/oz.</P><P>
	In mid-October, <STRONG>Alamos Gold Inc. (AGI:CA) (AGI)</STRONG> announced it was acquiring <STRONG>Carlisle Goldfields Ltd. (CGJ:CA) (CGJCF)</STRONG>, which has the Lynn Lake Gold Camp in Manitoba, Canada, in an all-share deal. Alamos already owned 19.9% of Carlisle and 25% of the Lynn Lake project. Carlisle's stock price shot up some 70% after the news. Alamos' shares dipped slightly along with the news that Alamos will be significantly reducing the dividend and issuing more shares.</P><P>
	Gwen Preston, editor and publisher of <I>Resource Maven, </I>says, &quot;Everyone with a dollar is looking. The challenge with timing the market is that the exact bottom is apparent only in hindsight and money is scarce for taking chances.&quot; She sees that fear as particularly true of the majors. &quot;They are afraid of making a mistake so they tend to be conservative and wait until they can see a clear upward trend and then they end up buying at the top.&quot;</P><P>
	As proof that deals are getting done, Preston cites the announcement in early October that <STRONG>Inca One Gold Corp. (IO:CA)</STRONG> would be purchasing <STRONG>Standard Tolling Co. (TON:CA)</STRONG> in a share exchange.</P><P>
	At the same time, she sees companies like First Mining Finance and Newmarket taking advantage of the opportunity to build their companies while the market is down. Many of these moves are not takeovers of entire companies in big splashy deals, but bite-size pieces as majors throw off non-core projects and mills get sold to any willing bidder to generate cash. &quot;A lot of confidentiality agreements have been signed and a lot of site visits are taking place,&quot; she says.</P><P>&quot;Right now any asset that can become the next low-cost producer is an acquisition target,&quot; according to Lin. &quot;But the asset has to make sense.&quot;</P><H2><B>Buyout Clues—The JV Signal</B></H2><P>
	One sign that a major is coveting a property is the producer's investment in developing projects. Cook points to Agnico Eagle's $15M investment in <STRONG>Belo Sun Mining Corp. (BSX:CA)</STRONG> at a 9% premium in May as significant.</P><P>
	Some acquirers have a pattern of taking over juniors after joint ventures. Lin points to OceanaGold as an example. &quot;Two years ago, it took over a company called Pacific Rim Mining Corp. in El Salvador. It's very high grade and could be very easy, low-cost mining, a world-class asset. First, OceanaGold embarked on a joint venture with the company to try to fund its exploration and then the share price continued to be low, so it just bought the company out. That's a very typical story of a takeover. You do a joint venture, allowing the company to derisk the project, and then when the time is right, buy it out.&quot;</P><P>
	Mazumdar also sees investment such as equity placement in an exploration company as a common first date on the path to a possible acquisition. &quot;When I worked for a major company in corporate development, we would commonly take up to a 19% stake in companies with assets that had the potential to evolve into a project worth acquiring and advancing. The stake translates to a confirmation of interest, but not necessarily a guarantee that the asset will eventually be acquired.&quot;</P><P>
	As a recent example, Mazumdar cites the acquisition in May 2015 of an equity stake in <STRONG>Gold Standard Ventures Corp. (GSV:CA)</STRONG>, (Not rated) by (again) OceanaGold. &quot;OceanaGold saw significant upside potential for Carlin-type deposits (low grade, open-pit heap leach and underground high grade) in the largest land package in the Carlin Trend not owned by Newmont Mining or Barrick Gold, (Hold rated by Tony Lesiak).&quot;</P><P>
	He clarifies, &quot;We note this differs from the outright acquisition of Cayden Resources (de-listed) by Agnico Eagle Mines (Buy rated by Tony Lesiak) in 2014 for a high quality, land package (El Barqueño) in Mexico, which did not host a resource at the time.&quot;</P><P>
	Preston suggests watching companies with a history of doing deals. She has her eye on Eldorado Gold Corp. (ELD:TSX; EGO:NYSE), which bought out Sino Gold for $2B in 2009 and now owns 15% of <STRONG>Integra Gold Corp. (ICG:CA) (ICGQF)</STRONG>. &quot;It is all about getting one foot in the door,&quot; she says.</P><H2><B>Location, Location</B></H2><P>
	Being located next door to a midtier or a major looking to grow can also weigh in the favor of a junior that could help to expand and replace ounces for a producer, according to the deal-watchers. &quot;Many deals are obviously project dependent,&quot; Lin says. &quot;If you are mining next to a major mine, it could be a good takeover target. That also happens during a boom in the market. The major wants to develop the mine and then it wants to buy out all the other small mines around it. Right now, the market is so weak, it's more likely to be a strategic investment for the future; assets that fit the acquirer's vision can be a value driver.&quot;</P><P>
	When Agnico Eagle announced the investment in Belo Sun, CEO Sean Boyd specifically called out the fact that Belo Sun's Volta Grande gold project is located in Brazil, a &quot;favorable mining jurisdiction.&quot;</P><H2><B>Derisked </B></H2><P>&quot;How derisked a project needs to be depends,&quot; says Cook. He uses the <STRONG>Kaminak Gold Corp. (KAM:CA)</STRONG> Coffee gold project in the Yukon as an example. &quot;It is a takeout target, but a lot of questions still need to be answered about the infrastructure capex costs. The more complex the project, the more derisked it needs to be before a buyer will pull the trigger.&quot;</P><P>
	Preston calls derisking vital to getting a deal done. &quot;The majors screwed up in the last bull market by buying before they knew projects were viable and management paid with their jobs. They will be much more careful this time around.&quot; She points to <STRONG>True Gold Mining Inc. (TGM:CA)</STRONG> in Burkina Faso as an example of a mine worth more than it is valued, but country risk means it needs to be more advanced before a buyer would want to pull the trigger.</P><P>&quot;We believe that the fundamentals of the gold market imply a medium- to long-term paucity of quality projects due predominantly to the lack of exploration and development underpinned by the relevant financing risk and the limited number of projects that actually generate a decent internal rate of return (IRR) in the current gold price environment,&quot; Mazumdar says. &quot;Our coverage universe includes companies with gold development projects that are effectively being derisked on a technical (feasibility studies), execution (permitted and in construction basis) and financing (funded, all or partial) basis. Some of these companies, we believe, may generate an M&amp;A bid as they are derisked to commercial production.&quot;</P><H2><B>Naming the Targets</B></H2><P>
	All of our experts have watchlists of companies they think could be acquirers and acquirees in the coming months. Lin doesn't think OceanaGold is done shopping yet. Like Mazumdar, in the wake of the Pacific Rim, Romarco and the Waihi gold mine deals, Lin took notice when OceanaGold announced a joint venture agreement with Gold Standard Ventures. &quot;OceanaGold put in money to acquire 14.9% of Gold Standard Ventures as a premium to the share price and it is still buying Gold Standard Ventures stock on the open market. That's a typical sign, the interest of a major company in a junior,&quot; Lin says. &quot;Gold Standard Ventures is currently drilling the south part of the deposit. Drillers already found a deep sulphide-based gold deposit on the north side. It's wide open space. There are lots of possibilities. Management now has a lot of capital to do exploration thanks to the recent investment from OceanaGold. That makes it an attractive takeover target.&quot;</P><P>
	Lin is watching a few other candidates that could be buyout targets. &quot;One of my favorite stocks, <STRONG>Pretium Resources Inc. (PVG:CA) (PVG)</STRONG>, is developing its mine in northern British Columbia. It is very high grade, low cost. So that will be a nice takeover target for other companies, either in the development stage or after it gets into production. The mine looks so good I think any gold major with the ability would like to buy it.&quot;</P><P>&quot;One exploration company that is very small right now, but just had a nice discovery and could be a takeover target, is <STRONG>Alexco Resource Corp. (AXU) (AXR:CA)</STRONG> in the Yukon,&quot; says Lin. &quot;It is its own high-grade silver district. At some point, I think a bigger company will come in because it has huge potential.&quot;</P><P>
	Moriarty is closely watching one with a number of very pressing clues. &quot;As a condition of a funding last year, <STRONG>IAMGOLD Corp. (IMG:CA) (IAG)</STRONG> pledged to use $500M in capital expenses or acquisitions and now only has a couple of months to do it. The company already tried to &quot;steal&quot; a project surrounding its own Côté ground owned by <STRONG>JV partner Sanatana Resources Inc. (STA:CA)</STRONG>. IAMGOLD management maintained that it needed the property for tailings and infrastructure. They walked away in November, but they would open themselves up to a giant suit from either their shareholders or from Sanatana if they don't buy Sanatana,&quot; he says. Moriarty estimates Sanatana has spent some $9.5M on the project and it would cost IAMGOLD between $50M and $70M to buy the company. Sanatana has about a $4M market cap right now. IAMGOLD could buy it cheap today or wait for gold to go up and pay a lot more money for it down the road. IAMGOLD paid $608M for Côté and admits it has to have the Sanatana ground to make Côté work.&quot;</P><P>
	Cook starts his quest for takeover candidates by naming the possible consolidators. &quot;First Mining Finance is busy creating a &quot;mineral bank&quot; by buying companies in the Americas and Canada while prices are low. It has 19 total projects in Mexico, Newfoundland and Nevada,&quot; he notes. Possibilities for First Mining or another opportunistic consolidator on Cook's list include Kaminak Gold, <STRONG>Asanko Gold Inc. (AKG) (AKG:CA)</STRONG>, <STRONG>Nevsun Resources Ltd. (NSU:CA) (NSU)</STRONG>, Premier Gold Mines and <STRONG>Richmont Mines Inc. (RIC) (RIC:CA)</STRONG>.</P><P>
	Preston puts Kaminak at the top of her list as well. &quot;This company has done a really impressive job in the last few years derisking the Coffee project. The feasibility study in the first quarter of 2016 could entice a bid.&quot; She sees <STRONG>Klondex Mines Ltd. (KDX:CA) (KLDX)</STRONG> as &quot;one of the better performing miners in the world right now. It is doing a good job at Midas and Fire Creek in Nevada building value. The problem is it would have to have a big buyer, so that may come later in the cycle.&quot; She also sees <STRONG>Sabina Gold &amp; Silver Corp. (SBB:CA) (RXC:FSE) (SGSVF)</STRONG> as a good example of an economic project trading below its peers, making it enticing for possible acquirers. &quot;The challenge is that investors know it is undervalued and they probably don't want to be taken out at this price.&quot;</P><P>
	As a region, Preston sees the majors looking at the Yukon again. &quot;Things are cheap there again and the government has put a lot of money into infrastructure and getting First Nations deals signed so that is a prospective area.&quot;</P><P>
	Mazumdar's examples include <STRONG>Torex Gold Resources Inc. (TXG:CA)</STRONG>, (Spec Buy rated by J. Mazumdar), Asanko Gold (Spec Buy rated by J. Mazumdar), <STRONG>Roxgold Inc. (ROG:CA)</STRONG>, Spec Buy rated by J. Mazumdar) and Pretium Resources (Speculative Buy rated by J. Mazumdar). &quot;Both Torex Gold and Asanko Gold are advancing, permitted, fully funded, high-grade open-pit projects (El Limon–Guajes and Phase 1 Obotan) in manageable jurisdictions (Mexico and Ghana) to commercial production in 2016. Roxgold is advancing a high-grade, underground project (Yaramoko project) in Burkina Faso to commercial production also in 2016. The Yaramoko project lies in a more challenged jurisdiction (Burkina Faso), but it generates the highest IRR of our coverage universe. Pretium Resources is advancing its high-grade Brucejack underground gold project in northwest British Columbia. Pretium Resources recently closed a US$540M financing package with a couple of private equity groups to fund the project (US$747M, company estimate),&quot; Mazumdar explains.</P><P>&quot;With respect to more advanced explorers that are derisking projects through advanced studies, we highlight <STRONG>Dalradian Resources Inc. (DNA:CA)</STRONG>, Speculative Buy rated by J. Mazumdar) that operates the Curraghinalt high-grade underground gold project in Northern Ireland. We believe the company is well funded to deliver a feasibility study in H2/16 followed by the submission of the permit application.&quot;</P><P>
	Mazumdar sums up the current M&amp;A <mark>climate</mark> this way, &quot;Potential suitors are seeking quality projects with valuation upside either technically and/or exploration related. Although grade is important, the potential generation of decent EBITDA and free cash flow margins in a stable jurisdiction is more critical.&quot;</P><P>
	Marin Katusa, founder of Katusa Research, has also been thinking about possible liquidity events. &quot;<STRONG>Midas Gold Corp. (MAX:CA)</STRONG> is a fantastic project that I believe a major will eventually want to own. It has a great management team, but it is suffering from two issues in this market: the permitting process—nobody cares about companies in that permitting period—and the cost to build that in this market. A company like Osisko Royalties or Goldcorp will come up and buy that asset,&quot; he predicts. &quot;That asset is a past producer, very high grade and has over 5 million ounces of gold. That's why I've taken a large position. It has the right management team and the right project. It has the right type of geology in the right jurisdiction. That's a contrarian bet on gold. Most people are undervaluing it today, and that's when you want to buy.&quot;</P><P>
	Lin's advice is to find a good company and hold on to it. &quot;When the market turns, they can often rise very quickly. I think M&amp;A activity in the gold sector will accelerate.&quot;</P><P><EM>Source: JT Long of The Gold Report</EM></P><P><EM>Want to read more Gold Report interviews like this? <A href=""http://www.theaureport.com/pub/htdocs/signupnow.html"" target=""_blank"">Sign up</A> for our free e-newsletter, and you'll learn when new articles have been published.

Sea ice is a cornerstone of the environment and culture of the study area but is also the main barrier to shipping traffic, which has been growing in the area. This paper presents a review of sea ice and shipping in the study area and an analysis of shipping accessibility as represented by the timing of breakup, freeze-up, and the open water season in its offshore and local waters. Offshore ice timing was analyzed using passive microwave-based data for 1980–2014; local ice timing near Rankin Inlet, Churchill, Kuujjuarapik/Whapmagoostui, and Salluit was examined using Canadian Ice Service ice charts for 1996–2016. Open water was defined using sea ice concentration thresholds of ≤15% (offshore) or &lt;20% (local) in an attempt to represent accessible conditions for open water shipping vessels. The results for both offshore and local waters display considerable spatial variability. For offshore waters, breakup currently occurs between 17 May and 19 August and freeze-up occurs between 22 October and 30 December, with overall trends (1980–2014) of +0.58 days year–1 towards an earlier breakup, +0.47 days year–1 towards a later freeze-up, and +0.97 days year–1 towards a longer open water season. Also, significant relationships amongst breakup and freeze-up were observed. For local waters, the 1996–2016 average open water season at the four communities varied between 112.7 days (Churchill) and 154.7 days (Kuujjuarapik/Whapmagoostui). Ultimately, shipping accessibility to Rankin Inlet, Churchill, and Salluit appears to be limited by their local ice timing, while accessibility to Kuujjuarapik/Whapmagoostui appears to be limited by ice timing in northeastern Hudson Bay.</P></DIV><H5 style=""padding-top:10px;"">Knowledge Domain:  Ocean Science </H5></DIV><DIV xmlns:TEI=""http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"" id=""xml-article""><DIV id=""middle"" class=""article-body""><STRONG>Domain Editor-in-Chief: </STRONG>Jody W.

As a result, the relationships between sea ice and society are evolving, which has provided the motivation for our research. This paper consists of two parts: first, a review of the literature covering sea ice and shipping in the study area; and second, a scientific assessment of shipping accessibility in the area, based on our analysis of ice timing in offshore waters and in the local waters near the communities of Rankin Inlet, Churchill, Kuujjuarapik/Whapmagoostui, and Salluit.</P><DIV class=""caption""><SPAN class=""label"">Figure 1

Coloured squares show the approximate location of the 25 km × 25 km pixels of the sea ice dataset. The area was divided into three regions for further analysis: “Hudson Bay” (aqua – includes James Bay), Hudson Strait (green), and Foxe Basin (blue). The four communities whose local ice-timing was examined using Canadian Ice Service ice charts are indicated with red circles; the remainder of the communities in the area are indicated with black dots.

There is good reason for this grouping: although each of the four regions is unique, they all share a close oceanographic relationship (see, for example, <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B41"" data-scroll=""#B41"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B41"">Joly et al., 2011</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B38"" data-scroll=""#B38"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B38"">Hochheim and Barber, 2014</A></STRONG></SPAN>). Unfortunately, there is no consensus on the term used to refer to the four marine regions collectively. Examples in the literature include the Hudson Bay system, the Hudson Bay Complex, the Greater Hudson Bay Marine Region, and others. Throughout this paper we simply refer to Hudson Bay, James Bay, Hudson Strait, and Foxe Basin as the “study area” (Figure <SPAN class=""xref""><A href=""#F1"">1</A></SPAN>).</P><P>The study area encompasses five major administrative regions within Canada: Nunavik and Eeyou Istchee of northwestern Quebec, Nunavut, Manitoba, and Ontario. The area is home to 39 formal communities dotted along the coast (Figure <SPAN class=""xref""><A href=""#F1"">1</A></SPAN>), with a total population of roughly 50,000 (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B68"" data-scroll=""#B68"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B68"">Statistics Canada, 2016</A></STRONG></SPAN>). Indigenous people make up the vast majority of the population in these 39 communities. The majority of residents in the communities of Nunavut and Nunavik are Inuit, and the majority of residents in the coastal communities of Eeyou Istchee and northern Ontario are Cree (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B67"" data-scroll=""#B67"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B67"">Statistics Canada, 2011</A></STRONG></SPAN>). Of the 39 communities, only Churchill, Manitoba, and the nine communities of James Bay are accessible by rail or road (all-weather or winter). The remaining 29 communities (and roughly 27,000 people) can be accessed only by sea or air.</P><P>Sea ice is fundamental to the culture and sustenance of the Inuit people in the study area: sea ice is a seasonal extension of their homeland that enables travel and wildlife harvesting (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B40"" data-scroll=""#B40"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B40"">Inuit Circumpolar Council – Canada, 2008</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B6"" data-scroll=""#B6"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B6"">Aporta, 2010</A></STRONG></SPAN>). Inuit people have spent generations learning the nuances and subtleties of their local sea ice, and the seasonal ice covering forms a familiar, well-travelled topography (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B45"" data-scroll=""#B45"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B45"">Laidler and Elee, 2008</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B47"" data-scroll=""#B47"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B47"">Laidler et al., 2009</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B6"" data-scroll=""#B6"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B6"">Aporta, 2010</A></STRONG></SPAN>). Furthermore, many residents of the study area obtain a considerable portion of their food from wildlife harvested on sea ice (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B17"" data-scroll=""#B17"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B17"">Chan et al., 2006</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B26"" data-scroll=""#B26"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B26"">Ford, 2009</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B47"" data-scroll=""#B47"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B47"">Laidler et al., 2009</A></STRONG></SPAN>). On the other hand, sea ice is the greatest barrier to shipping in the study area (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B43"" data-scroll=""#B43"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B43"">Kelley and Ljubicic, 2012</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B21"" data-scroll=""#B21"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B21"">Engler and Pelot, 2013</A></STRONG></SPAN>).

As previously indicated, most of the communities in the region (29 communities, roughly 27,000 people) can be accessed only by sea or air. As a result, marine re-supply (sealift) provides these communities with essential supplies that are too heavy or too costly to be flown, such as fuel, housing materials, construction supplies, vehicles, and non-perishable food items (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B40"" data-scroll=""#B40"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B40"">Inuit Circumpolar Council – Canada, 2008</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B8"" data-scroll=""#B8"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B8"">Arctic Council, 2009</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B10"" data-scroll=""#B10"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B10"">Brooks and Frost, 2012</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B5"" data-scroll=""#B5"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B5"">Andrews et al., 2016</A></STRONG></SPAN>).

The study area defined in this analysis includes 1,559 of the 25 × 25 km “pixels” (Figure <SPAN class=""xref""><A href=""#F1"">1</A></SPAN>). The area was also subdivided into three regions for further analysis: Hudson Bay (1,181 pixels), Hudson Strait (197 pixels), and Foxe Basin (181 pixels). The “Hudson Bay” region defined for this analysis includes James Bay.</P><P>As can be seen in Figure <SPAN class=""xref""><A href=""#F1"">1</A></SPAN>, pixels directly bordering the coast were not included in the analysis. They were excluded for two reasons: to minimize the influence of near-shore landfast ice or any other highly local, coastline ice in our desired offshore results; and to avoid the erroneous data that can sometimes arise in passive-microwave datasets for near-shore locations. Because no pixels bordering the coast were included in the dataset, the offshore analysis excludes coastal marine waters up to a maximum of 71 km from shore, as follows. Pixels have dimensions of 25 × 25 km (and a diagonal length of ~35.4 km), and a pixel containing any land is labeled as “coast”. Thus pixels labeled as coast in the dataset may include marine waters up to 35.4 km offshore. As a result, pixels bordering the coast may actually border a region nearly 35.4 km from shore; the exclusion of these pixels therefore results in a data-less zone of up to 71 km (&lt;35.4 + 35.4 km) from shore.</P><P>The timing of open water conditions for each pixel from 1980–2014 was determined using the following method. For each year, breakup was recorded as the first of three consecutive days with ice concentrations ≤ 15%, freeze-up was recorded as the first of three consecutive days with ice concentrations &gt; 15%, and the open water season was the number of days between breakup and freeze-up. The three-day window used for breakup and freeze-up insured that transient ice motion and other short-term variations in ice concentration did not affect our analysis; we experimented with longer time windows (e.g., 7 days), but they made no appreciable difference to the results. The 15% concentration threshold for open water conditions was selected as the best representation of accessible conditions for open water shipping vessels. A 15% ice concentration has been similarly applied as a shipping accessibility threshold in several publications (e.g., <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B9"" data-scroll=""#B9"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B9"">Bensassi et al., 2016</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B4"" data-scroll=""#B4"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B4"">Andrews et al., 2017</A></STRONG></SPAN>) and more generally as an open water threshold in others (e.g., <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B66"" data-scroll=""#B66"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B66"">Stammerjohn et al., 2008</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B56"" data-scroll=""#B56"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B56"">Parkinson, 2014</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B72"" data-scroll=""#B72"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B72"">Stroeve et al., 2016</A></STRONG></SPAN>).</P><P>Regression analysis was used to examine trends in the timing of breakup, freeze-up, and the open water season for each pixel for 1980 to 2014. Statistical analysis suggested that the data for each variable follow a normal distribution and that no dataset exhibits significant autocorrelation. Multiple types of regression analysis were applied to the data, and linear regression yielded the best fits and the most statistically rigorous results for each variable. As a result, linear regression was used for the trend analysis. It has been suggested that sea ice timing is changing in a non-linear fashion in the study area (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B44"" data-scroll=""#B44"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B44"">Kowal et al., 2017</A></STRONG></SPAN>), but we did not observe this pattern in our data. Finally, linear regression was also used to examine the relationships between breakup and freeze-up dates for each pixel.</P><P>The Cavalieri et al. (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B15"" data-scroll=""#B15"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B15"">1996</A></STRONG></SPAN>) dataset used here and other similar passive microwave-based datasets have been used extensively for sea ice analyses similar to the research we are presenting in this paper (e.g., <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B66"" data-scroll=""#B66"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B66"">Stammerjohn et al., 2008</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B14"" data-scroll=""#B14"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B14"">Cavalieri and Parkinson, 2012</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B38"" data-scroll=""#B38"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B38"">Hochheim and Barber, 2014</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B56"" data-scroll=""#B56"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B56"">Parkinson, 2014</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B72"" data-scroll=""#B72"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B72"">Stroeve et al., 2016</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B4"" data-scroll=""#B4"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B4"">Andrews et al., 2017</A></STRONG></SPAN>). A more thorough discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the Cavalieri et al. (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B15"" data-scroll=""#B15"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B15"">1996</A></STRONG></SPAN>) dataset in our context can be found in Andrews et al. (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B4"" data-scroll=""#B4"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B4"">2017</A></STRONG></SPAN>).</P></DIV><DIV><H3>Local sea ice analysis</H3><DIV><H4 class=""tl-default"">CIS Ice Charts</H4><P>The timing of sea ice near Rankin Inlet, Churchill, Kuuj/Whap, and Salluit, was examined for 1996 to 2016 using ice charts created by the Canadian Ice Service (CIS) for the “Hudson Bay region” (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B37"" data-scroll=""#B37"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B37"">Government of Canada, 2016</A></STRONG></SPAN>). The CIS ice charts present the geographic distribution of sea ice within a region, with the ice grouped into “polygons” (i.e., areas) of equal ice concentration. Each polygon is labelled with information on the sea ice within it, including the ice concentration, stage of development, and form. But there is another layer of information: polygons often contain variation in the sea ice within them, and in these cases the different sub-areas of sea ice within each polygon are described. The CIS charts present ice concentrations in tenths (/10ths). Since 1982 the charts have been labelled using the ice “Egg Code” maintained by the World Meteorological Organization (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B23"" data-scroll=""#B23"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B23"">Environment and <mark>Climate Change</mark> Canada, 2016</A></STRONG></SPAN>).</P><P>The ice data from CIS charts have been used for numerous quantitative analyses published in the scientific literature but there are some important qualifiers and caveats. Put briefly, CIS ice charts have been created since the 1960s by ice experts using the best-available information from surface observations, aerial observations, and satellite data (both visual and microwave-based). However, “best-available” has changed since the 1960s and so has the demand for ice charts. As a result, the methodology used to create the charts and the frequency of their production has changed considerably over the decades. With respect to methodology, two points in particular are worth elaborating: the proportion of ice chart content derived from satellite observations and the proportion derived from “now-casting”. First, the proportion of ice chart data based on satellite observations grew from 15% prior to 1978, to 50–55% from 1978 to 1995, and finally to 80% in 1996 with the introduction of RADARSAT (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B12"" data-scroll=""#B12"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B12"">Canadian Ice Service, 2006</A></STRONG></SPAN>). Second, the CIS has often used a process called “now-casting” to produce ice charts when timely ice observations are not available. When now-casting, CIS experts estimate ice conditions at the time of the chart’s creation by extrapolating from earlier observations (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B12"" data-scroll=""#B12"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B12"">Canadian Ice Service, 2006</A></STRONG></SPAN>). The ice estimates based upon now-casting carry considerable uncertainty (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B74"" data-scroll=""#B74"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B74"">Tivy et al., 2011</A></STRONG></SPAN>). Prior to 1996, an average of 50% of the data in Arctic ice charts were the product of now-casting based on observations taken an average of 5 or more days prior to a chart’s creation (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B12"" data-scroll=""#B12"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B12"">Canadian Ice Service, 2006</A></STRONG></SPAN>). Since 1996, with the introduction of RADARSAT and the more timely availability of data, an average of only 20% of data in the Arctic charts has been produced through now-casting, from observations only 1 day prior to a chart’s creation (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B12"" data-scroll=""#B12"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B12"">Canadian Ice Service, 2006</A></STRONG></SPAN>).</P><P>Tivy et al. (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B74"" data-scroll=""#B74"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B74"">2011</A></STRONG></SPAN>) thoroughly examined the quality of the CIS sea ice data to assess their validity for statistical analysis. The authors discuss now-casting and technological changes and note a further important source of error: the quality of ice observations has not typically been homogeneous across all Arctic regions (or ice chart areas) at any given time. As a result there is variability in the quality of data within each ice chart, with the highest-quality data typically found near communities and shipping routes. For example, we observed that the region near Deception Bay (and the shipping route for the Raglan nickel mine) appeared to have more detailed data than surrounding areas in the ice charts for 2011 to 2016.</P><P>The CIS’s changing methodology has resulted in an archive of ice data that vary in quality both within and between charts, which affects the suitability of the data for statistical analyses. Nonetheless, after a thorough consideration of uncertainty and error, Tivy et al. (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B74"" data-scroll=""#B74"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B74"">2011</A></STRONG></SPAN>) ranked the CIS data for our study area as “fair” to “excellent” on their “Quality Index”, which was created to “portray the variability in data quality over space and time”. Furthermore, the CIS ice chart data has been used for numerous studies examining multi-decadal trends in ice conditions within our study area. For example, Tivy et al. (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B74"" data-scroll=""#B74"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B74"">2011</A></STRONG></SPAN>), Galbraith and Larouche (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B30"" data-scroll=""#B30"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B30"">2011</A></STRONG></SPAN>), and Kowal et al. (<SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B44"" data-scroll=""#B44"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B44"">2017</A></STRONG></SPAN>) all compare charts from the 1970s or 1980s to the present within their trend analyses. However, we deemed this methodology inappropriate for our application. The aforementioned articles applied the CIS data on a relatively large geographic scale, which may minimize some of the possible error from the sources discussed. Our research, on the other hand, seeks to examine sea ice conditions at a small, local scale. Out of caution, we used only CIS charts for 1996 to 2016 in our analysis; these charts are all within the RADARSAT era, they are largely based on satellite observations (~80%), and they contain relatively little content from now-casting (~20% on average).</P><P>Our four study communities – Rankin Inlet, Churchill, Kuuj/Whap, and Salluit – are all encompassed within the area of the CIS ice charts for the Hudson Bay region. These charts were created at a shifting frequency between 1996 and 2016. From 1980 to 2007 the charts were created monthly from January through April, every second week during May, and weekly from June through December. From 2007 to 2011 the charts were created every second week from January through March and weekly from April through December. Since 2008 the charts have been created on a weekly basis throughout the year. These general timing patterns, however, were occasionally interrupted by missing charts or longer time gaps.</P></DIV><DIV><H4 class=""tl-default"">Local breakup, freeze-up, and open water</H4><P>The 1996–2016 CIS ice charts for the Hudson Bay region were used to examine the local timing of landfast ice and the open water season for each of the four studies communities. “Local” here refers to the marine waters within a 50-km radius of Churchill and Kuuj/Whap, and within a 50-km radius of the entrance to the Rankin and Salluit inlets (“community areas” shown in Figure <SPAN class=""xref""><A href=""#F2"">2</A></SPAN>). Landfast ice is directly labelled in the CIS data, while “open water” was defined using an ice concentration threshold of &lt;20% (i.e., &lt;2 tenths). The 20% concentration threshold was selected because it is the closest option to the offshore threshold of ≤15%.</P><DIV class=""caption""><SPAN class=""label"">Figure 2

Breakup for landfast ice and open water conditions were defined as the first week without landfast ice and the first week with no sea ice of concentration ≥20%, respectively. Freeze-up for landfast ice and open water conditions were defined as the first week with landfast ice and the first week with ice concentrations ≥20%, respectively. The open water season was calculated as the number of weeks between open water breakup and freeze-up (i.e., &lt;20% concentration).</P><P>In some years multiple “break-up” events occurred in a community area as ice departed, returned, and departed again over a short time frame (e.g., 3 weeks); in these circumstances the final breakup was used for our record. Similarly, in some years multiple “freeze-up” events occurred; in these circumstances the earliest event was used for our record. As a result of this methodology our measurements reflect the latest possible breakup and earliest possible freeze-up, given the data, and therefore produce a relatively conservative estimate for open water conditions at the 20% ice concentration threshold.</P><P>Our data from the CIS ice charts were not examined for trends between 1996 and 2011. We did not feel confident that the results would be scientifically rigorous, because of the short 21-year time period and because the timing of the available CIS charts present some difficulties for analysis. The identification of ice timing (i.e., breakup or freeze-up date) using the CIS charts carries a minimum uncertainty of one week, which was the case with all breakup and freeze-up dates for the 20% concentration threshold. Furthermore, the freeze-up and breakup of landfast ice at the four communities occurred quite regularly during months where CIS charts were created only once per two weeks or once per month; in these cases, the identification of ice timing carried a two-week or one-month uncertainty. Finally, occasional ice charts were missing from the record, resulting in increased uncertainty for several measurements of landfast ice timing.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV><H3>Local versus offshore comparisons</H3><P>There is no consensus on whether ice concentration from CIS ice charts and passive-microwave observations may be partnered reliably for scientific analysis. Some studies have observed considerable discrepancies between ice concentrations from CIS charts versus passive-microwave methods (e.g., <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B1"" data-scroll=""#B1"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B1"">Agnew and Howell, 2003</A></STRONG></SPAN>), though others have indicated reasonable agreement in results from the two different data sources (e.g., <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B74"" data-scroll=""#B74"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B74"">Tivy et al., 2011</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B44"" data-scroll=""#B44"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B44"">Kowal et al., 2017</A></STRONG></SPAN>; <SPAN class=""xref""><STRONG><A class=""scroll-link"" href=""#B4"" data-scroll=""#B4"" rel=""footnote"" id=""main-text-B4"">Andrews et al., 2017</A></STRONG></SPAN>). In this article we do not compare results quantitatively from the two different analytical methods (local versus offshore). To compensate, the CIS charts were used to provide an element of offshore analysis: we tested each community breakup and freeze-up for the presence of a channel of open water extending continuously from the community area boundary to the eastern end of our study area as shown in Figure <SPAN class=""xref""><A href=""#F1"">1</A></SPAN>. There was no minimum width for the channel and there was no requirement of a direct route, only continuous open water conditions (ice concentration &lt; 20%) along some channel between the community area and the eastern edge of the study area at the time of local breakup or freeze-up.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV><H2 class=""article-division"">Results</H2><DIV><H3>Offshore sea ice analysis</H3><DIV><H4 class=""tl-default"">Current sea ice timing (2010–2014)</H4><P>Figure <SPAN class=""xref""><A href=""#F3"">3</A></SPAN> shows the median timing of open water conditions in the study area for 1981–1985, 1996–2000, and 2010–2014.

Frank Basa, CEO of Canada Cobalt Works Inc., and his team have laid out a path to production at the historic mine in the heart of Ontario’s cobalt camp. As major cobalt supply concerns are on the horizon, investors are focusing on development/exploration cobalt plays like Canada Cobalt Works.</P><P>Historically, production at the Castle Mine site was largely concentrated around silver, producing more than 9.5 million ounces of silver and 300,000 pounds of cobalt in the 1900s. Now that demand for cobalt has skyrocketed, CCW is planning to revamp the Castle Mine as a major cobalt producer.</P><P> </P><P><EM>Figure 1: Native Silver in Drill Core from CCW’s Historic Castle Mine</EM><EM> Source: Company Fact Shet</EM></P><P>“The Castle Mine has always been a cobalt property,” said Mr. Basa about the Company’s name change. “Over the last hundred years, they mined silver and threw a lot of the cobalt away. Right now, the lithium-ion battery market demands a lot of cobalt.”</P><P>Cobalt is undoubtedly one of the hottest commodities over the past two years. An essential component of lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles and mobile phones, cobalt is facing a severe supply deficit in the coming years. Apple Inc. recently announced plans to source cobalt directly from miners, and other companies are looking to do the same. The problem, however, lies in the fact that right now cobalt is sourced primarily from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a politically unstable nation that faces accusations of widespread human rights issues in the mining industry. What’s more, on March 9, the DRC president signed a new mining law, raising taxes and royalties on mining operations, with a potential increase in cobalt royalties to 10% from 2%, as well as a 50% tax on super-profits (when commodity prices increase above 25% in the price used in a project’s feasibility study). “There’s no way that companies can afford a 50% mining tax,” said Mr. Basa. “You can make a big discovery, but you can’t get the cobalt out of the country.”</P><P>Alternative sources of cobalt production are in higher demand now than ever before. In the race to get conflict-free cobalt into the market, Canada Cobalt Works may have a leg up on its peers with its underground access at the Castle mine and its historical cobalt production. The Canada Cobalt Works  team is using what it calls “real time” development to advance the project by building a mill, undergoing further exploration work and getting its permits, all at the same time. “When the resource is done, we will have all of our permits in place, and the mill will likely be installed,” said Mr. Basa.</P><P>In February 2018, Canada Cobalt Works announced the permitting process for the installation of a 600 tpd mill at the Castle Mine site. The mill is expected to be financed by <STRONG>Granada Gold Mine Inc.</STRONG> (<A href=""https://smallcappower.com/module/?page=detailedquotetabchartnews&amp;symbol=GGM:CA"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">TSXV:GGM</A>) through debt. CCW would then become the operator to provide custom milling services in the northern Ontario Cobalt Camp.</P><P>Canada Cobalt Works has a two- to three-year plan to put the Castle Cobalt Silver property into production. This year the team will focus on underground exploration work, planning additional bulk sampling and drilling to test for cobalt and other metals in various vein structures. CCW is also planning to use a proprietary technology, called Re-2OX, developed by Mr. Basa during his years with Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (<A href=""https://smallcappower.com/module/?page=detailedquotetabchartnews&amp;symbol=AEM:CA"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">TSX:AEM</A>) to efficiently extract the cobalt from the ore. The process is designed to produce cobalt sulphate to specifications necessary for battery sector end users.</P><P>“It’s a hydrometallurgical closed-loop process, so there’s very little environmental impact, and it separates all the metals, not just cobalt,” explains Mr. Basa. The Company is planning follow-up lab testing to recover lithium, cobalt and other metals from used batteries as well.</P><P>With its Re-20X process, upcoming dewatering &amp; underground drill program, and planned new infrastrucure, Canada Cobalt Works is well positioned to benefit from the continuing uptrend in cobalt prices, driven by the electric vehicle revolution.</P><P><STRONG><EM>To find out more about </EM></STRONG><A href=""https://smallcappower.com/companies/ccw/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><STRONG><EM>Canada Cobalt Works Inc.</EM></STRONG></A><STRONG><EM>, please visit the company’s </EM></STRONG><A href=""https://smallcappower.com/companies/ccw/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><STRONG><EM>Investor Hub</EM></STRONG></A><STRONG><EM>.</EM></STRONG></P><FORM id=""mc4wp-form-1"" class=""mc4wp-form mc4wp-form-55369 mc4wp-ajax"" method=""post"" data-id=""55369"" data-name=""Canada Cobalt Works Inc.""><DIV class=""mc4wp-form-fields""><DIV class=""nws_form""><SPAN class=""text"">Sign Up To Get Updates On How Canada Cobalt Works Inc.
