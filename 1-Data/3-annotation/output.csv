He had the evidence of an Austrian explorer with a “photographic memory” who said melting glaciers and ice cover had started almost 90 years ago.</P><P>Putin didn’t name the explorer, but said he had visited the Franz Josef Land archipelago in 1930, where Putin himself had been the day before his remarks.</P><P>Twenty years after that, the explorer was shown photographs of another expedition taken of the area by “the future King of Italy” and, according to Putin, the explorer concluded there were fewer icebergs than when he had been there.</P><P>“That’s when there were no such anthropological factors, such emissions, and the warming had already started,” said Putin. Based on this flimsy account, Putin said there was nothing to be done about climate change, and that it was all bound up with something well beyond humanity’s control anyway.</P><P>“The issue is not stopping it, because that’s impossible since it could be tied to some global cycles on Earth or even of planetary significance,” Putin said.</P><P class=""image  align-left""><SPAN class=""caption"" style=""width: 300px !important;"">
			Putin at the Arctic: Territory of Dialogue conference. (Photo: Courtesy of Mikhail Metzel, TASS)		</SPAN></P><P>But it doesn’t have to be all bad.</P><P>“Climate change brings in more favorable conditions and improves the economic potential of this region,” he told <A href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/30/vladimir-putin-russia-trump-us-climate-policy.html"">CNBC</A> from the conference. “Today, Russia’s GDP is the result of the economic activity of this region.”</P><P>Putin hasn’t called climate change a “<A href=""https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en"">hoax</A>” perpetrated by the Chinese, like Donald Trump famously has, but the two men are fond of signaling major policy changes that fly in the face of evidence, science and common sense by citing the advice of vague friends and acquaintances.</P><P>Trump, for instance, has a “<A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/trump-bernhard-langer-voting-fraud.html"">very famous</A>” German golfing buddy who can prove that he won his squeaker election by many millions more votes than he actually did. Likewise, Trump’s “very, very substantial” <A href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/13/who-is-trumps-friend-jim"">Francophile friend</A> “John” told him that Paris has turned into a rat’s nest of refugee terrorists, and cited that to justify a US immigration ban. No one has yet been able to figure out if John is real.</P><P>But that’s beside the point. Putin and Trump’s friends – real or imagined – are drawing them together, and these friends are apparently urging them following each other’s cues on environmental policy.</P><P>Putin’s shift on climate change – which he told the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015 “has become one of the most serious challenges facing humanity” – came with a big wink to the Trump administration.</P><P>Last week, Trump instructed <A href=""http://bellona.org/news/fossil-fuels/2016-12-trump-chooses-climate-denier-whos-suing-the-epa-to-run-it"">Scott Pruitt</A>, his appointee to run the Environmental Protection Agency who has said loudly he doesn’t believe climate change is real, <A href=""http://bellona.org/news/climate-change/international-climate-conferences/2017-03-trump-poised-take-first-steps-against-climate-action-%c2%ac-and-trip-into-a-legal-morass"">to start undoing the Obama era Clean Power Plan</A>, a policy to limit greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning power plants. The plan formed the cornerstone of America’s commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement, in which 194 countries agreed to meet national benchmarks in reducing planet-warming emissions.</P><P>Two days later, Trump’s press spokesman Sean Spicer signaled the administration would decide whether America would pull out of Paris – as Trump threatened to do on the campaign trail – by next month.</P><P>From the Arctic conference, Putin praised Pruitt, telling CNBC that people like the EPA administrator “who are not in agreement with opponents may not be at all silly.”</P><P>While Putin reaffirmed Russia’s commitment to reaching Paris goals, he again massaged the Trump administration by demurring to comment on the White House’s seeming desire to buck the agreement.</P><P>“I would not dramatize things, and I wouldn’t use these global factors for the domestic American political struggle,” he told CNBC.</P><P>He might do well to stay silent: While US Congress the Senate, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are probing possible Kremlin meddling undergirding Trump’s surprise presidential victory, their collusion in public to undermine the Paris Accord could hardly be more obvious.</P><P>Central to that <A href=""http://bellona.org/news/fossil-fuels/2017-01-putin-hacks-his-own-election-tarring-paris-accord-with-exxonmobil-oil"">potential backstairs relationship</A> might be the Arctic’s vast reserves of oil. A $500 billion deal between Exxon Mobil, formerly headed by Trump’s Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and Russia’s Rosneft oil company to drill the Arctic was put on ice when the Obama Administration imposed sanctions on Russia in 2014. Trump’s opponent Hillary Clinton, was unlikely to repeal those sanctions, but Trump has said he might.</P><P>To further persuade him, Putin and his Austrian explorer friend apparently see the benefit in endorsing Trump’s destructive climate change denial.</P><P><EM>Anna Kireeva contributed to this report.</EM></P><P> </P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,0.0,Neutral

Last year, <A href=""https://www.cdp.net/en"">CDP</A>, formerly called the “<mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project,” took a look at how — and if — high-environment-impact businesses were responding to the 2016 Paris <mark>Climate</mark> agreement. The companies’ initial actions were a bit disappointing, with many companies not responding or not having plans in motion for meeting the Paris accord’s <mark>climate</mark> goals. Taking a second look this year, however, CDP found the picture is changing, as more companies are mapping out a low-<mark>carbon</mark> future. While some politicians continue to stubbornly ignore <mark>climate change</mark>, businesses are, nonetheless, getting down to work.</P><P>The CDP is a major source of company <mark>carbon</mark> emission data for more than 800 investors managing assets of over $100 trillion. It tracks corporations’ environmental behavior, including their transparency, philosophies, and actions. The non-profit organization also measures companies’ efforts to protect water and forests. Over 6,200 companies disclose environmental data to the CDP.</P><P>The first encouraging sign in this year’s CDP findings is that 58% of the high-impact combines responded to CDP’s requests for information. These companies frepresent the entire global economy, weighted towards higher <mark>carbon</mark> emitters and big companies. Together they account for 47% of market capitalization and 12% of total greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P><SPAN style=""color: #737d83; font-size: 13px;"">(CDP)</SPAN></P><P>Even more positive is the number of companies now joining CDP’s <A href=""https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/comfy/cms/files/files/000/001/290/original/A_list.pdf"">A List</A>, 112 companies whose environmental leadership earns them CDP’s <A href=""https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/guidance_docs/pdfs/000/000/233/original/Scoring-Introduction.pdf?1479494696"">highest score</A>.

Nord Stream 2, as the project is called, has provoked controversy in Europe – but the pipeline is planned to be in use as soon as 2019. Supporters of Nord Stream 2 make two bold claims: Ukraine is apparently an untrustworthy partner for gas transit, and Europe supposedly needs more Russian gas. Both arguments are questionable, and there are good reasons to put the project on ice.</P><P>First of all, transporting gas through Ukraine is not a major supply risk for Europe. It is almost impossible to imagine that today’s Ukraine would even consider interrupting the flow of gas to the EU. After all, Ukraine benefits greatly from the EU’s political and economic support. Kiev would not want to jeopardise that. Moreover, any break in gas transit would provoke the building of a pipeline avoiding Ukraine, and thereby actually endanger Ukraine’s own gas supply. This is because Ukraine gets a third of its gas supplies from the EU, in the form of reimports from Slovakia.</P><P>On the other hand, Ukraine would be sure to see the building of Nord Stream 2 as a clear sign of distrust from Europe. Indeed, Ukraine has redoubled its efforts to reform its gas sector, and the changes are already bearing fruit. The state-owned gas company needs much less public subsidy, and gas consumption is massively reduced. Western gas companies are setting up in the Ukrainian market, and there is justified hope that in some years Ukraine will be able to meet all its own gas needs from domestic production.</P><P>Without gas transit through Ukraine, EU countries would not really have enough gas to supply Ukraine from the west. These supplies consist overwhelmingly of gas that originally flowed into Slovakia through Ukraine. Therefore, bypassing Ukraine with Nord Stream 2 would force Kiev to return to buying gas directly from <mark>Gazprom</mark>. This dependant relationship would probably be more than just economic in nature. Is that really a situation that the EU wants to encourage?</P><P>The second main argument for Nord Stream 2 is that falling gas production in north-west Europe makes additional infrastructure for Russian imports necessary. But increasing needs can be met for at least the next decade using existing pipelines: in 2014 there was 100 billion m<SUP>3</SUP> of unused capacity from Russia. What’s more, renewable energies and improvements in energy efficiency offer hope that gas demand might actually fall. Even if the need for imports does suddenly shoot up, Europe is still in no danger of a gas supply crisis. Necessary extra gas can easily be imported from overseas at any time using the existing liquid gas terminals.</P><P>In fact, Nord Stream 2 could weaken Europe’s resolve to find alternatives to Russian gas. <mark>Gazprom</mark> would surely try to use the new pipeline at full capacity, and the constant stream of gas could be flexibly priced to react to any competition. This would make the development of other supplies and energy sources difficult over the coming decades.</P><P>Nord Stream 2 is of strategic importance for Russia and the EU, in terms of both energy and geopolitics. But the interests of the two partners do not neatly overlap. Building the pipeline too soon would leave Ukraine dependent on direct Russian gas exports, and hinder the search for alternative supplies in Europe. In any case, risks around transit or demand over the next 5-10 years seem to be manageable with the existing infrastructure.</P><P>So the best idea is simply to wait on making the decision. If it becomes clear that a route bypassing Ukraine is needed, or additional imports become necessary, the plan can always be taken back down from the shelf. But for the moment the project would do the EU more harm than good.</P><DIV class=""republishing""><H4>Republishing and referencing</H4><P>Bruegel considers itself a public good and takes no institutional standpoint.</P><P>Due to copyright agreements we ask that you kindly email request to republish opinions that have appeared in print to <A href=""mailto:communication@bruegel.org"">communication@bruegel.org</A>.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></BODY></HTML>",0.0,1.0,Negative

Heede concludes that nearly two-thirds of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emitted since the 1750s can be traced to the 90 largest fossil fuel and cement producers, most of which still operate. online</P><P>The research attributes 63 percent of the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and methane emitted between 1751 and 2010 to just 90 entities. Fifty are investor-owned companies such as Chevron, Peabody, Shell, and BHP Billiton. Thirty-one are state-owned companies such as Saudi Aramco and Statoil, and nine are government-run industries in countries such as China, Poland, and the former Soviet Union. The research also classified the 90 entities according to type of fossil fuel extracted and marketed.</P><P>There are 56 oil and natural gas companies, and 37 coal producers. In addition, the <mark>CO2</mark> emissions from seven cement manufacturers are included.</P><P><STRONG>Top 20 investor- and state-owned entities and attributed <mark>CO2</mark> &amp; CH4 emissions 2010</STRONG></P><TABLE border=""2"" cellspacing=""5px"" cellpadding=""5px""><TBODY><TR><TD valign=""middle""><B>Entity</B></TD></TR><TR><TD valign=""middle"">3.

State-owned companies contributed 288 gigatonnes.</P><P>The largest investor-owned producers have had an outsize effect on emissions.

He collected data on crude oil, natural gas, coal, and cement production worldwide by three types of entities: investor-owned (e.g. ExxonMobil), state-owned (e.g. Saudi Aramco) and government-run entities (e.g. North Korea’s coal industry).</P><P>The availability of production data for each entity and the timing of Heede’s research dictated the dominant timeframe (1854-2010) for this study. The threshold for inclusion was at least 8 million tonnes of <mark>carbon</mark> (MtC) produced in a recent year, which focused attention on a manageable number of entities and highlighted those companies responsible for most of the current warming.</P><P>When an entity merged or was acquired, its emissions prior to that point were attributed to the extant entity. To accurately account for <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions, all non-combustion uses of hydro<mark>carbon</mark>, such as oil used for petrochemicals, lubricants, and asphalt were subtracted and the amount of CO<SUB>2 </SUB>each fuel type releases upon combustion calculated. To ensure conversion rates were standardized, the analysis relied on international guidelines for <mark>carbon</mark> content of all fuel types.</P><P>The analysis also included calculations of a producer’s direct emissions via flaring and venting processes, emissions from entities using their own fuel, and fugitive emissions of methane from oil and gas operations and coal mining.</P><P><B>IMPLICATIONS</B></P><P>It’s difficult for researchers to find complete extraction records, so there are advantages to greater corporate and government transparency requirements, including more thorough assessments of direct and product-related emissions.</P><P>In addition to further analysis that can be conducted through the dataset itself, the approach — looking at producers rather than nations — opens many doors for future research. Scientists running <mark>climate</mark> models, for instance, could use this data to determine how different effects of <mark>climate change</mark> can be attributed to the 90 entities in the study.</P><P>The results may also have practical policy applications. The United Nations Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, the primary forum for international <mark>climate</mark> discussions, typically focuses on responsibility at the country level. This research provides another lens to examine global <mark>climate policy</mark> because it offers the first comprehensive accounting of historical emissions from producers, including many multinational institutions that initially extracted fuels from the earth.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV><DIV id=""secondary"" class=""widget-area"" role=""complementary""><DIV id=""widgetsearch""><P>Looking for something particular?</P></DIV><DIV id=""sidesocial""><DIV id=""sidenewsletter""><P>Sign up for our newsletter, and we will keep you posted on developments.</P></DIV><DIV id=""sidefbtwit""><P>Follow us: Facebook or Twitter</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><FOOTER id=""colophon"" class=""site-footer"" role=""contentinfo""><DIV id=""insidefooter""><DIV class=""site-info"">

BASF’s Chairman Kurt Bock, an advocate of shale gas exploitation in Europe, swatted aside questions about the <mark>climate change</mark> impact of shale gas on the basis that most people in the world still get their energy predominantly from fossil fuels so it should be okay for BASF, too.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">And this, just minutes after holding up a car part made from BASF’s engineered plastic and exclaiming that it is lighter than the metal it was designed to replace and so would improve fuel efficiency and hence the environmental performance of vehicles.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">Given that there is broad scientific consensus on anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark>, it shows how leading chemical companies such as BASF – one of the world’s most innovative companies – is potentially both part of the solution and still part of the problem. And that’s a business model set to attract greater scrutiny as scientific understanding about anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> sharpens.</P><DIV id=""attachment_679"" style=""width: 310px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">LIGHTWEIGHT: BASF’s Kurt Bock shows off lighter car components made from its engineered plastic but the firm has yet to roll out “holy grail” processes such as those that use <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide as a raw material.</P></DIV><P class=""MsoNormal"">The struggle for companies like BASF remains one of doing better for people and planet while also making money for shareholders. Right now the s</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">hareholders appear to be winning. The shift to truly <mark>sustainable</mark> technologies seemingly is too expensive or too difficult – or both. Yes new technologies are being developed, but by and large the pace of change is incremental. And being less bad for the environment doesn’t qualify as <mark>sustainable</mark>.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">As Bock mentioned in Ludwigshafen, truly <mark>sustainable</mark> processes such as those that consume <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide remain the “holy grail” of the chemical industry. But as Bock also noted it was too early for him to be able to provide details about BASF’s activities in this field because they haven’t been sufficiently developed.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">On the one hand BASF and many other chemical companies could be blamed for this state of affairs: They make a profit and only pay the current value for</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">their raw materials, such as fossil fuels. The next generation will pick up the full (and hidden) costs, including those resulting from <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">On the other hand, all chemical companies are working in the best way that they can within the current regulations and that means staying as profitable as they can, otherwise they might not survive at all.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">A potential solution for breaking this deadlock is to markedly accelerate <mark>innovation</mark> in <mark>sustainable</mark> processes by creating closer ties between academia, industry and government. Government should step up its role of funding R&amp;D for <mark>sustainable</mark> processes, and additionally provide tax breaks and a tax regime that is attractive enough for chemical companies to make the early investment in R&amp;D for truly <mark>sustainable</mark> (not less bad) processes without going broke.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">The need for closer ties between chemical firms and academia and government was a central theme taken up by a panel of experts meeting in the past week at the Royal Society of Chemistry in London as one of the best ways for “future-proofing” chemical companies and the users of chemicals. “Just in the U.K. we throw away the same number of <mark>carbon</mark> atoms that we spend £1.5 trillion [$2.5 trillion] buying in this country,” said industry veteran Ian Shott, who among his other roles is head of the Scotland’s new national center for industrial biotechnology. “There is an enormous opportunity here,” he says.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">So curing the chemical industry’s <mark>climate change</mark> schizophrenia might enable chemical companies and their users to be future-proof too.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">Shott is not the only chemicals expert advocating a closer working relationship between academia and industry as a way of securing growth and unlocking <mark>sustainable</mark> technologies. The other panelists at the RSC meeting, including David Jakubovic, open <mark>innovation</mark> director for Procter &amp; Gamble, Tony Ryan, chemistry professor and pro-vice chancellor for the University of Sheffield in the U.K., and Andrew Burgess, chief scientist for Akzo Nobel, the company hosting the meeting, also voiced support for bringing academics and industrialists closer together to accelerate <mark>innovation</mark>. Cross-fertilization of technologies across the supply chain could further accelerate <mark>innovation</mark>, the panellists agreed.</P><P class=""MsoNormal"">The chemical industry’s <mark>climate change</mark> schizophrenia, as demonstrated by Bock, will go on for some time yet. But the sooner the collective chemistry brains from academia and industry come closer together – as advocated by Shott and others – the sooner chemistry can really be unleashed to tackle <mark>climate change</mark>. Then maybe Bock and other chemical industry leaders can start talking about the ‘holy grail’ chemistries that we are really interested in.</P></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,2.0,Negative

They also argued that the public nuisance alleged by Oakland and San Francisco was not authorized by law, that the Clean Air Act did not displace the public nuisance claims, and that the relief sought by the cities would not constitute extraterritorial regulation in violation of the dormant Commerce Clause.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>05/03/2018</TD><TD>Response submitted by plaintiffs in opposition to BP p.l.c.'s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>05/03/2018</TD><TD>Response submitted in opposition to ConocoPhillips's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>05/03/2018</TD><TD>Response submitted in opposition to defendants' motion to dismiss.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>05/03/2018</TD><TD>Response submitted in opposition to Exxon Mobil Corporation's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>05/03/2018</TD><TD>Response submitted in opposition to Royal Dutch Shell plc's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/24/2018</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/climate-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2018/20180424_docket-317-cv-06011_notice.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Second notice re briefing on motion to dismiss issued by court.</TD><TD>On April 24, 2018, the court asked the parties to address the applicability of the Supreme Court’s decision on that day in Jesner v.

All of the defendants joined in a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, in which they reiterated arguments from their March 20 motion to dismiss the original complaint: that federal common law claims were either displaced by federal statutes or were “plainly improper”; that the plaintiffs failed to allege the elements of a nuisance claim; and that even if the plaintiffs pleaded a viable claim, judicial resolution would be inappropriate because it would violate separation of powers. Each defendant other than Chevron Corporation also filed a new motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, and Royal Dutch Shell plc (Shell) again also sought dismissal on the basis of insufficient service of process. The defendants addressed four questions that the court on March 27 had requested be addressed in the briefing on the motion to dismiss. They said they were aware of no cases sustaining a nuisance theory of liability based on the otherwise lawful sale of a product where the seller finance or sponsored research or advertising intended to cast doubt on studies showing that use of the product was harmful. They also told the court that “no global-warming-based nuisance claim has ever made it past the pleadings,” argued that the plaintiffs sought to hold them liable for speech “plainly immunized” by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, and asserted that the plaintiffs’ “expansive theory of liability has no limiting principle.” The plaintiffs’ response to the motions to dismiss was due by May 3, and defendants’ replies were due by May 10. The court had also set a deadline of May 10 for the United States to submit an amicus brief if it wished to do so. A hearing on the motions to dismiss was scheduled for May 24. </TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/19/2018</TD><TD>Motion to dismiss first amended complaints for lack of personal jurisdiction filed by BP p.l.c.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/18/2018</TD><TD>Motion filed by United States for extension of time to consider whether to participate as amicus curiae.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/18/2018</TD><TD>Order issued setting deadline of May 10, 2018 for United States to file amicus brief.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/04/2018</TD><TD>Redlined first amended complaint filed by plaintiffs (San Francisco).</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/04/2018</TD><TD>Redlined first amended complaint filed by plaintiffs (Oakland).</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/04/2018</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/climate-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2018/20180404_docket-317-cv-06011_order-1.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Order issued setting schedules for motions to dismiss amended complaint.</TD><TD>The court deemed the March 20 motions to dismiss withdrawn, and new motions to dismiss the amended complaints are due on April 19.

The five named defendants joined in a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. First, they argued that Congress had displaced federal common law claims based on domestic activities, whether those activities involved combustion of fossil fuels (in which case the Clean Air Act displaced federal common law) or production and promotion of fossil fuels (in which case “many federal statutes … expressly regulate (and, in fact, encourage) such conduct)). The defendants also argued that federal common law principles would not support recognition of a claim based on the defendants’ foreign activities. Second, the fossil fuel companies argued that elements of a federal common law claim for public nuisance were absent. The defendants asserted (1) that the plaintiffs had not alleged and could not allege that the defendants’ conduct was unauthorized by law; (2) that it was undisputed that the defendants did not control the fossil fuels at the time of the alleged creation of the nuisance (i.e., the time of combustion); (3) that the complaint’s allegations did not establish causation, since the claims depended “on an attenuated causal chain including billions of intervening third parties—i.e., fossil fuel users like Plaintiffs themselves—and complex environmental phenomena occurring worldwide over many decades”; and (4) that the damages sought by the plaintiffs in the form of an “abatement fund” could not be awarded because plaintiffs had not alleged actual harm, only “speculative future harms that may never eventuate.” The defendants also argued that damages would violate the defendants’ due process and First Amendment rights. Finally, the defendants asserted that judicial relief would violate separation of powers by invading the executive branch’s authority to conduct foreign affairs and legislative authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/climate-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2018/20180320_docket-317-cv-06011_motion-to-dismiss-2.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction filed by ConocoPhillips Company.</TD><TD>Four of the defendants filed separate motions to dismiss on personal jurisdiction grounds, arguing that the court could not exercise either general jurisdiction over the companies—two of which were non-U.S. companies and two of which were headquartered in Texas and incorporated in other states (one in New Jersey, one in Delaware)—or specific jurisdiction based on the companies’ alleged activities in and contacts with California.

Connecticut; Requested “Tutorial” on Climate Change.</STRONG> The federal district court for the Northern District of California denied Oakland’s and San Francisco’s motions to remand their climate change public nuisance lawsuits against five major fossil fuel producers to state court. The court held that federal common law necessarily governed the nuisance claims because “[a] patchwork of fifty different answers to the same fundamental global issue would be unworkable” and “the extent of any judicial relief should be uniform across our nation.” The court stated: “Plaintiffs’ claims for public nuisance, though pled as state-law claims, depend on a global complex of geophysical cause and effect involving all nations of the planet (and the oceans and atmosphere). It necessarily involves the relationships between the United States and all other nations. It demands to be governed by as universal a rule of apportioning responsibility as is available.” The court dispensed with the cities’ three primary arguments for remanding the cases. First, the court said the cities’ novel theories of liability based on the defendants’ sales of their product did not differentiate their claims from earlier transboundary pollution suits in which the Supreme Court (American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut) and Ninth Circuit (Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp.) applied federal common law. Second, the court said the Clean Air Act did not displace the plaintiffs’ federal common law claims, allowing state law to govern; the court said that while the Clean Air Act spoke directly to the “domestic emissions” issues presented in American Electric Power and Kivalina, “[h]ere, the Clean Air Act does not provide a sufficient legislative solution to the nuisance alleged to warrant a conclusion that this legislation has occupied the field to the exclusion of federal common law.” Third, the court said the well-pleaded complaint rule did not bar removal. The court also indicated in dicta that “the very instrumentality of plaintiffs’ alleged injury — the flooding of coastal lands — is, by definition, the navigable waters of the United States. Plaintiffs’ claims therefore necessarily implicate an area quintessentially within the province of the federal courts.” The court said defendants had not waived this issue. The court certified the decision for interlocutory appeal, finding that the issue of whether the nuisance claims were removable because such claims are governed by federal common law was a controlling question as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that resolution by the court of appeals would materially advance the litigation. The court’s order also noted that six similar actions brought by other California municipalities were pending before another judge in the district and those actions asserted additional non-nuisance claims. </TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/19/2018</TD><TD>Defendants' reply to plaintiffs' supplemental brief on navigable waters of the United States filed.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/19/2018</TD><TD>Plaintiffs' supplemental reply brief on navigable waters of the United States filed.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/16/2018</TD><TD>Defendants' response to request for supplemental briefing filed.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/16/2018</TD><TD>Plaintiffs' supplemental brief on navigable waters of the United States filed.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/12/2018</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/climate-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2018/20180212_docket-317-cv-06011_request-1.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Request for supplemental briefing issued.</TD><TD><STRONG>Federal Court in Oakland and California Climate Change Suits Against Fossil Fuel Producers Asked for Additional Briefing on Navigable Waters Issue.</STRONG> The federal district court for the Northern District of California considering whether to remand Oakland and San Francisco's climate change lawsuits against fossil fuel producers issued a request for supplemental briefing on the issue of how the concept of “navigable waters of the United States” related to removal jurisdiction.

The parties completed their briefing on the remand motion on January 15, 2018. In their reply in support of remand, the city attorneys asserted that the defendants’ assertions of federal jurisdiction “would federalize vast areas of traditional state law.” They emphasized that they did not seek to limit anyone’s emissions and that the only remedy sought was an “abatement fund” to shift adaptation costs from the public to the fossil fuel companies. The city attorneys also argued that the argument that the cases arose under federal law suffered from the “fatal defect” that they relied on “ordinary preemption doctrines” that did not provide a basis for removal.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>12/19/2017</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/climate-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2017/20171219_docket-317-cv-06011_opposition-1.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Joint opposition to motion to remand filed by defendants.</TD><TD>In their opposition to the remand motion, the defendants asserted that the cases “implicate longstanding federal government policies, concerning matters of uniquely national importance, including the Nation’s supply of energy and the global environment” and argued that the plaintiffs’ actions necessarily were governed by federal common law and necessarily raised federal questions by seeking “to supplant federal domestic and foreigh policy on greenhouse gas emissions to hold a handful of energy producers liable for the alleged consequences of rising ocean levels on a discrete portion of the U.S. coast.” The defendants also argued that the Clean Air Act completely preempted the actions because the statute “provides the exclusive cause of action for regulation of nationwide emissions.” The defendants also reiterated their arguments that the actions were removable because they were based on the defendants’ activities on federal lands and at the direction of the federal government, and because the claims would have an impact on a number of bankruptcy proceedings, not just Texaco’s, and because exemptions from bankruptcy jurisdiction for governmental exercises of police power were construed narrowly. </TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>12/14/2017</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/climate-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2017/20171214_docket-317-cv-06011_complaint.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Third-party complaint filed by Chevron Corp.</TD><TD>Chevron Corporation filed a third-party complaint against Statoil ASA—an energy company of which the Norwegian State is majority stakeholder—for indemnity and contribution.

But as simple as working blimps seemed, Rist had trouble getting his model airborne. </P><P>An engineer by nature if not by training, he realized putting wings on the inflatable craft might do the trick. When he sketched his idea for Brian Martin, a friend and co- worker who had studied shipping methods in a business class in college, a lofty vision emerged: They could launch a FedEx-like shipping revolution, powered by airships that slashed air freight costs and reached less-accessible regions. </P><P>Before long, the budding entrepreneurs had formed Ohio Airships. The centerpiece of their venture, still in the making after 14 years, is a hybrid aircraft dubbed the Dynalifter. The 120-foot-long, pickle-shaped prototype at Toledo Express Airport resembles a blimp: Its soft but tough skin, similar to a boat’s sail, encases balloon-like cells filled with helium. </P><P>But like an airplane, the Dynalifter has wings with propellers that provide about half its lift. The fuselage holds an internal framework modeled after cable-stayed bridge construction, bearing the pressure on towers. This design is the key to enabling future Dynalifters, at about three to eight times the length of the prototype, to lift concentrated loads weighing up to 160 tons without collapsing, as an ordinary blimp surely would.</P></DIV><DIV class=""section""><DIV class=""layoutArea""><P> Ohio Airships will cater to the underserved market in global transportation that lies between jets, ships, trains and trucks. A jet might be four times as fast, but a Dynalifter would consume less fuel and further cut costs by providing more space for large, bulky payloads, from flowers to bulldozers. Makeshift runways would suffice for Dynalifter takeoffs and landings, putting destinations without airports in reach. A Dynalifter could cross oceans, too, and much faster than a ship. Unlike trains and other shipping options, the Dynalifter does not need transportation infrastructure, such as rails, roads or seaports.</P><P>After a successful testing of the prototype last winter, Rist continues to seek investors and manufacturers for the roughly $40 million job of creating the first full-fledged Dynalifter. Those other Ohio plane builders, the Wright brothers of Kitty Hawk fame, would have approved.</P><P class=""p1""><EM>[This article originally appeared in print as &quot;Super Fly: Hybrid Airship Aims High.&quot;]</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""div-gpt-ad-1349448567992-5""><DIV style=""text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #ccc;padding-top:5px"" class=""adHeader"">ADVERTISEMENT</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></FORM></BODY></HTML>",0.0,0.0,

It therefore includes the Arctic 30 – the 28 activists and two freelance journalists who were arrested following a protest at a <mark>Gazprom</mark>-operated Arctic oil platform in the Pechora Sea on September 18.</P><DIV id=""attachment_81140"" style=""width: 384px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><P class=""wp-caption-text""><STRONG>Greenpeace activist, left, puts his hands up as Russian Coast Guard officers, center masked, disrupt the action. Another Greenpeacer hangs from a rope thrown upon the <mark>Gazprom</mark> drilling rig, September 18, 2013. (Photo courtesy Greenpeace).</STRONG></P></DIV><P>Several of the Greenpeace activists attempted to scale the oil platform to dramatize their contention that oil extraction in Arctic waters risks  spills that would be impossible to clean up, and burning the fossil fuel would accelerate <mark>climate change</mark>. Originally also charged with piracy, that charge against the Arctic 30 was dropped by Russian prosecutors.</P><P>A ruling in November by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ordered Russia to allow the Arctic 30 to leave the country immediately and to release the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise, as soon as a bond of 3.6 million euros in the form of a bank guarantee was paid. That bond was posted by the Government of the Netherlands – where the Arctic Sunrise is registered – on November 29. The ship is still in Russian hands and Russia is now in defiance of that order.</P><P>While the Arctic 30 were in prison, first in Murmansk and later in St. Petersburg, <mark>Gazprom</mark> was not idle.</P><P>Today the Russian oil giant announced it has produced the first commercial quantities of oil from its Arctic drilling platform Prirazlomnaya in the remote waters of the Pechora Sea.</P><P>Oil production at Prirazlomnaya is the first commercial oil extraction from the Arctic shelf anywhere in the world.</P><P>The Prirazlomnaya platform was the focus of the Greenpeace protest in September which led to the arrest and imprisonment of the Arctic 30.</P><P>In response, Greenpeace said that the “clock is ticking” on a major environmental accident in the Arctic region.</P><P>One of the Arctic 30, Faiza Oulahsen of the Netherlands, said, “This is a dark day for the Arctic. <mark>Gazprom</mark> is the first company on Earth to pump oil from beneath icy Arctic waters and yet its safety record on land is appalling. It is impossible to trust them to drill safely in one of the most fragile and beautiful regions on Earth.”</P><P>“This is why I have spent the last two months of my life in jail, but I am just one of millions who oppose this reckless oil rush,” said Oulahsen. “We must stop this trickle of Arctic oil before it becomes a flood.”</P><DIV id=""attachment_47946"" style=""width: 360px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text""><mark>Gazprom</mark>’s Prirazlomnaya platform (Photo courtesy <mark>Gazprom</mark>)</P></DIV><P>“The timing of this announcement is intriguing, to say the least. When <mark>Gazprom</mark> called the authorities and instructed them to arrest us, they never bargained for the global outrage they sparked. Now we are going home and <mark>Gazprom</mark> is licking its wounds,” said Oulahsen.</P><P>“Announcing they have started producing oil does not dissuade us, it makes us more determined than ever to grow this global movement to save the Arctic. We’ve already discovered more oil than we’ll ever need if we’re going to avoid dangerous <mark>climate change</mark>. Looking for more of the stuff in the beautiful fragile Arctic is an act of extreme folly,” she said.</P><P>The offshore Arctic is characterized by freezing temperatures, thick ice, months of constant twilight, giant storms and hurricane-force winds that pose technical risks to any oil company. Greenpeace warns, “There is no proven way of cleaning oil spilled in ice and even a small accident would have devastating consequences on the Arctic’s fragile and little-understood environment.”</P><P>To realize its goal of opening up more of the Arctic to oil exploration, which Russia aims to turn into its “resource base of the 21st century,” <mark>Gazprom</mark> has signed an exploration deal with Shell that will provide it with new capital and much-needed expertise in offshore drilling, even though Shell’s own 2012 attempts to drill in the Alaskan Arctic were marked by a series of repeated accidents and embarrassing safety blunders.</P><P>Yet this deal represents a huge financial and reputational risk for Shell and its investors.</P><P>A recent report written by Greenpeace, Share Action and Platform examined at the risks posed by Shell’s deal with <mark>Gazprom</mark>. It concluded that the partnership may expose Shell and its investors to risks associated with the Russian firm’s poor record on safety, environment and transparency.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,2.0,Negative

But is that really what the automaker will be doing in five years? A closer examination of Ford’s discussion with <EM>Fortune</EM> editor Alan Murray provides a few more clues.</P><P><STRONG>A push towards partnerships</STRONG></P><P>The interest in mobility—all the different ways people get around urban and rural areas—has never been higher, particularly around finding ways to reduce traffic congestion. But, as Ford points out, eventually the company will have to monetize and make a business out of these ideas. It’s why he believes there will be more startups working with companies “like ours.”</P><P>“That’s going to be incumbent upon us,” he reflected. “That’s a muscle we haven’t used in many, many years, and we have to be accessible to young companies and know how to work with them.”</P><P><EM><A href=""http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/"">Subscribe to Data Sheet</A>, </EM>Fortune<EM>’s daily newsletter about technology.</EM></P><P>This could mean more cooperation with startups—like its own 2011 partnership with Zipcar—or even an acquisition, such as GM’s recent <A href=""http://fortune.com/2016/03/11/gm-buying-self-driving-tech-startup-for-more-than-1-billion/"">$1 billion purchase of Cruise Automation</A>. Ford is in a position to tap into startup talent. The company backs a startup accelerator called Techstars Mobility, and it has an research and <mark>innovation</mark> lab in Silicon Valley.</P><P><STRONG>A bet on plug-in hybrid electrics</STRONG></P><P>Earlier this year, Ford Motor announced plans to spend $4.5 billion to produce 13 electrified vehicles models. Yet, as the executive chairman noted, there isn’t a great pull for electrification from the customer right now. One look at the numbers, and the challenge to convert to electric is clear. Ford sold 780,354 F-150 trucks in 2015, compared to less than 1,600 Ford Focus electric vehicles.</P><P>So while the company is investing in all-electric vehicles, Ford sees more short-term promise in plug-in hybrid cars, which run on a combination of gas and electric.</P><P>“As a transitional technology plug-in hybrids make a lot of sense,” Ford said. “If you drive in a daily commute, let’s say in San Francisco all week, you could be on your electric battery and never tap into your internal combustion engine. But if you wanted to go to Los Angeles for the weekend, you could do that too without any range anxiety. So I think that’s a very interesting transitional technology, particularly for people where it’s their only vehicle.”</P><P><STRONG>Targeting cities</STRONG></P><P>Ford has found more success working with local governments than the feds. Expect that strategy continue as it develops autonomous vehicle technology and experiments with car-sharing, on-demand parking, and ride-sharing business models.</P><P>“Cities around the world are often best places to try things to take the lead,” Ford posited. “There’s often less red tape, a bigger more identified need by the politicians and more receptivity.”</P><P>“It’s a tough environment, there’s no question,” he added in reference to Washington D.C. “It’s hard to get much of anything done.”</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""bottom-recirc padded-mobile "" data-tracking-zone=""bottom-recirc""><DIV class=""component lead-gen clearfix bottom-recirc"" data-endpoint=""https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&amp;v=2&amp;callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&amp;format=json&amp;imgsize=256x143"" data-mobile-endpoint=""https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&amp;v=2&amp;callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&amp;format=json&amp;imgsize=256x143"" data-partial=""sponsored-tile"" data-variation=""bottom-recirc"" data-title=""SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT"" data-provider=""dianomi"" data-tracking-zone=""dianomi-bottom-recirc"" data-tracking-zone=""dianomi-right-rail"" data-logo=""http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png"" data-logo_url=""https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&amp;utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank"" data-native_ad=""%7B%22dimensions%22%3A%22482x100%22%2C%22placement%22%3A%22footer%22%2C%22priority%22%3A6%7D"" data-nativekey=""wAcSQW5rUVzGCkuf6AZTLmdV""><DIV class=""title-wrapper""><H3 class=""subtitle"">SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,2.0,Positive

Simpson said Exxon and <mark>Chevron</mark> should ramp up investments in clean energy to avoid being caught by sudden technology shifts.</P><P>While BP Plc <A class=""component stock-ticker"" data-symbol=""BP"">(BP)</A>, Statoil ASA <A class=""component stock-ticker"" data-symbol=""stohf"">(stohf)</A> and other European oil companies including <A href=""http://fortune.com/2016/05/16/shell-new-energies-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">Royal Dutch Shell</A><A class=""component stock-ticker"" data-symbol=""rdsa"">(rdsa)</A> have begun releasing myriad data points on how their businesses will respond to <mark>climate change</mark>, <mark>Chevron</mark> and Exxon have lagged them, critics say.</P><P>Success of any one of the <mark>climate</mark>-related votes at Wednesday’s meetings is not certain.</P><P>Exxon shareholders have never approved a <mark>climate change</mark>-related proposal, and last year they rejected by 79 percent a request that a <mark>climate</mark> expert be appointed to the company’s board.</P><P>Another measure, which would have the companies increase payouts to shareholders and stop investing in oil and gas deposits, appears doomed to fail.</P><P>Still, environmentalists and some investors, sensing the tide turning in their favor, hope to notch at least some victories.</P><P>Already, proxy advisory firm ISS has recommended shareholders of both companies support the resolutions, a key voice of support.</P><P>Exxon lost a public battle with New York State’s comptroller earlier this year when the U.S. <A href=""http://fortune.com/2016/03/23/exxon-mobil-<mark>climate</mark>-change-vote/"">Securities and Exchange Commission ruled it must let shareholders vote</A> on a proposal that would require it to detail how its business will be hurt as governments crack down on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions.</P><P>“We believe it’s incumbent upon us as owners to find out what they’re doing (on <mark>climate</mark> research) and how that will affect their long-term business plan,” said Pete Trannis of New York State’s comptroller’s office. “It’s almost impossible to imagine they haven’t been doing some of this already.”</P><P>The so-called proxy access measure, which says minority shareholders with a 3 percent stake should be able to nominate directors to the company’s board, could pass this year after winning support from mutual fund behemoth Vanguard.</P><P>More than a dozen oil companies have passed proxy access, though Exxon’s board has opposed it. Insiders at oil companies worry proxy access could lead to <mark>climate</mark> activists opposed to oil drilling being voted on to company boards.</P><P>Though both Exxon and <mark>Chevron</mark> say their <mark>climate</mark> disclosures are plenty robust, shareholders are demanding more at annual meetings, partly because the SEC has declined their requests to tighten its 2010 rule requiring all U.S. companies to address potential <mark>climate change</mark> impacts.</P><P>“For the most part the SEC has not been too responsive, so investors have had to turn to other methods,” said Jim Coburn of Ceres, a sustainability group that has advocated at the SEC for tougher <mark>climate</mark> standards as far back as 2007 with CalPERS, the New York attorney general’s office and numerous state treasurers.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""bottom-recirc padded-mobile "" data-tracking-zone=""bottom-recirc""><DIV class=""component lead-gen clearfix bottom-recirc"" data-endpoint=""https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&amp;v=2&amp;callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&amp;format=json&amp;imgsize=256x143"" data-mobile-endpoint=""https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&amp;v=2&amp;callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&amp;format=json&amp;imgsize=256x143"" data-partial=""sponsored-tile"" data-variation=""bottom-recirc"" data-title=""SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT"" data-provider=""dianomi"" data-tracking-zone=""dianomi-bottom-recirc"" data-tracking-zone=""dianomi-right-rail"" data-logo=""http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png"" data-logo_url=""https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&amp;utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank"" data-native_ad=""%7B%22dimensions%22%3A%22482x100%22%2C%22placement%22%3A%22footer%22%2C%22priority%22%3A6%7D"" data-nativekey=""wAcSQW5rUVzGCkuf6AZTLmdV""><DIV class=""title-wrapper""><H3 class=""subtitle"">SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,2.0,Neutral

The legislation does not require that they purchase any land so landowners are always left with the liability of abandoned wells once the company has finished it’s operations. However the whole exploration and surveying process is extremely vulnerable to concerted local resistance and is the first opportunity a community has to resist the industry on the ground. Fracking companies need unfettered access to land across the whole survey area and an informed and organised community is in a very good position to deny this. By banding together and refusing access to lots of properties and causing disruption the cost of the survey can be greatly increased and in some cases stopped entirely.

The product and audience was chosen based on two premises – urbanization is happening in the world’s major cities and transportation is being heavily impacted; Millennials in their late teens to early 30s are the right market to start with, since they’re not buying cars as much as previous generations, are moving to cities, and want functional, practical transportation alternatives.

China's CEFC looks set to unseat Trafigura as Rosneft's main oil trading partner in Asia after securing a five-year deal to take 60 million tons of crude from Russia's energy giant, industry sources said.
</P><P>International trading firm Trafigura is now Rosneft's main buyer of seaborne volumes of ESPO Blend and Sakhalin Sokol oil.
</P><P>But the crude lifting deal with CEFC, which in September became Rosneft's second biggest shareholder by taking a more than 14 percent stake, suggests a shift by the Russian oil firm which has rotated its main lifters every few years.
</P><DIV class=""show-more""><DIV class=""more-content""><P>For CEFC, the deal is the next step in its drive to create a globally integrated oil supply chain. The Chinese firm has already built a trading team in Beijing and hired traders for its new Singapore office, market sources said.
</P><P>In January, CEFC receives its first 200,000 tons of ESPO from Kozmino port and 200,000 tons of Sokol crude via DeKastri terminal, alongside some Urals oil from Novorosiisk, three traders told Reuters.
</P><P>From April, CEFC plans to take seven to nine cargoes a month of ESPO from Rosneft, the same amount Trafigura now buys, the traders added.
</P><P>&quot;If CEFC starts to buy as much ESPO from Rosneft, there will be just nothing left for Trafigura,&quot; a ESPO trader said.
</P><P>An industry source said Rosneft could not increase ESPO loadings at Russia's Kozmino due to the Pacific port's capacity limits. Kozmino can load 2.6 million to 2.8 million tons of ESPO Blend a month, with Rosneft accounting for about 1 million.
</P><P>Rosneft is already committed to selling a minimum of one cargo of ESPO a month to China National Petroleum Corp in a state-to-state deal, while China's Chemchina will receive one or two cargoes a month under a term contract.
</P><P>That leaves Rosneft with seven to nine cargoes a month to sell, which is the volume it has now agreed to send to CEFC.
</P><P>Trafigura declined to respond when asked about the shift in trade, saying it did not comment on commercial matters. Rosneft and CEFC did not respond to Reuters request for comment.
</P><P>Under its deal with Rosneft, CEFC plans to supply China's small, privately owned &quot;teapot&quot; refineries, which want ESPO due to lower transport costs compared with crude from other ports.
</P><P>Rosneft has tended to shift between traders every few years. Gunvor once dominated Rosneft’s trade in Europe but then lost ground to Glencore and Vitol, which both offered prefinance contracts. Trafigura then took over as Rosneft's biggest lifter of seaborne crude volumes in Europe and Asia.
</P><P>Although Trafigura now looks set to lose its top position in Asia, a trading source said it was expected to increase its presence in supplying Rosneft's crude to Western destinations.
</P><P>&quot;If CEFC is likely to replace Trafigura in the East, I think Rosneft will think of some compensation for its old ally. There will be Urals to offer,&quot; he said.
</P><P>Rosneft's five-year prefinance contracts with Glencore and Vitol expire in March, which could free up about 1 million tons of Urals a month for April-December 2018, traders said. Rosneft has yet to indicate how that volume will be divided.

      have agreed to expand their cooperation under their 2011 Strategic 
      Cooperation Agreement to include an additional approximately 600,000 
      square kilometers (150 million acres) of exploration acreage in the 
      Russian Arctic and potential participation by Rosneft (or its affiliate) 
      in the Point Thomson project in Alaska. They have also agreed to conduct 
      a joint study on a potential LNG project in the Russian Far East.
    </P><P>
      The agreements, which include plans to explore seven new blocks in the 
      Chukchi Sea, Laptev Sea and Kara Sea, were signed by Igor Sechin, 
      president of Rosneft, and Stephen Greenlee, president of ExxonMobil 
      Exploration Company, in the presence of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
    </P><P>
      The license blocks include Severo-Vrangelevsky-1, Severo-Vrangelevsky-2 
      and Yuzhno-Chukotsky blocks in Chukchi Sea, Ust’ Oleneksky, Ust’ Lensky 
      and Anisinsko Novosibirsky blocks in Laptev Sea and Severo Karsky block 
      in Kara Sea, which are among the most promising and least explored 
      offshore areas globally.
    </P><P>
      A separate Heads of Agreement was signed providing Rosneft (or its 
      affiliate) an opportunity to acquire a 25 percent interest in the Point 
      Thomson Unit, which covers development of a remote natural gas and 
      condensate field on Alaska’s North Slope. It is estimated that Point 
      Thomson contains approximately 25 percent of the known gas resource base 
      in Alaska’s North Slope.
    </P><P>
      Rosneft and ExxonMobil also executed a Memorandum of Understanding to 
      jointly study the economic viability of an LNG development in the 
      Russian Far East, including the possible construction of an LNG 
      facility. The companies will form a joint working group, which is 
      expected to commence work in the coming weeks to study the viability of 
      an LNG project using available natural gas resources.
    </P><P>
      Commenting on the agreements signed, Igor Sechin said, “The agreements 
      signed today bring the already unprecedented scale of the Rosneft and 
      ExxonMobil partnership up to a completely new level. The acreage in the 
      Russian Arctic subject to geological exploration and subsequent 
      development increased nearly six-fold. That means the enormous resource 
      potential of Russian Arctic offshore fields will be explored and 
      developed in the most efficient manner with the application of 
      cutting-edge technologies and expertise of our strategic partner, 
      ExxonMobil, and using state-of-the-art environmental protection systems. 
      Participation in the Point Thomson project will increase Rosneft’s 
      access to the latest gas and condensate field development technologies 
      used in harsh climatic conditions.”
    </P><P>
      Stephen Greenlee said the agreements build on the ongoing successful 
      cooperation between the companies. “This expansion is an illustration of 
      the strength of the partnership that exists between ExxonMobil and 
      Rosneft,” said Greenlee. “We look forward to working together on these 
      new projects.”
    </P><P>
      The companies are committed to using global best practices and 
      state-of-the-art safety and environmental protection systems for the 
      Arctic operations. The work will be supported by the recently signed 
      Declaration on the Russian Arctic Shelf Environmental protection. Also, 
      ExxonMobil and Rosneft will work together through an Arctic Research 
      Center to provide a full range of research and design services to 
      support their cooperation on Arctic projects.
    </P><P>
      Rosneft and ExxonMobil continue to implement a program of staff 
      exchanges of technical and management employees to help strengthen 
      relationships between the companies.

The campaign group is particularly critical of BP’s ongoing sponsorship of the British Museum in the UK.</P><P>The documents reveal what Culture Unstained calls the “close working relationship between UK government and BP over Russia” despite the fact that the material “suggests that BP is attempting to bypass sanctions preventing shale drilling in Russia.”</P><P>The British Government’s hypocrisy is evident in the fact that despite taking a strong public line on Russia, the UK government has been helping BP water down US sanctions and hosting events to boost UK ties with Russian oil and gas sector.</P><P>Over a period of several months, the documents outline how BP had numerous meetings with British government ministers and embassy staff, with British Ministers repeatedly offering support for BP’s business in Russia.</P><P>For example, in February 2017, the British Embassy in Russia hosted a ‘Seminar on Vocation and Professional Education in the Oil and Gas Sector’. It was designed to strengthen collaboration on “UK and Russia education companies, schools and universities in one of the key industries – oil and gas”. The President of BP Russia, David Campbell, gave the opening remarks at the event.</P><P>Two months later, the Department for International Trade hosted a workshop on “How to break into the Russian Oil &amp; Gas Sector”.  It highlighted that: “Maintaining oil &amp; gas production requires large scale use of new technologies, which largely are not restricted by sanctions’, and offered ‘Presentations by legal advisers about sanctions”.</P><P>Meanwhile, in June 2017, when new US Sanctions on Russia were being proposed<STRONG>,</STRONG> BP and other oil companies started mobilising against the US bill. Within days, the British Embassy in Russia emailed BP to discuss “what this could mean for UK interests”.  Of particular concern was BP’s 19.75% stake in Russian state oil company, Rosneft.</P><P>That same month, in a meeting with the British trade minister, Greg Hands, in June 2017, the documents suggest BP appears to have been attempting to work around sanctions to gain approval for an unconventional shale oil project.</P><P>BP was waiting for a license that “In the company’s view… turns on the definition of shale”. EU sanctions had aimed to prevent European companies helping Russian companies extract unconventional oil, by ruling out oil “located in shale formations by way of hydraulic fracturing”.</P><P>Within months, according to Culture Unstained, BP’s lobbying effort against US sanctions “seems to have been successful”.</P><P>On 2 August, BP CEO Bob Dudley <A href=""https://www.ft.com/content/6ffe1ebc-782d-11e7-90c0-90a9d1bc9691"">told market analysts</A> that the original draft of the sanctions bill had been full of “‘very significant unintended consequences’ but now the company was not “aware of any material adverse effect on our current income and investment in Russia or elsewhere, or our ability to work with Rosneft itself”.</P><P>Chris Garrard, Co-director of Culture Unstained, argues that: “BP is turning massive profits in Russia by partnering with Rosneft, a company responsible for record numbers of oil spills, turning a blind eye to corruption and cozying up to Putin’s notorious ‘right-hand man’. But instead of holding BP to account, the UK government seems willing to help the company sidestep sanctions while the British Museum launders its brand.”</P><DIV id=""attachment_27793"" style=""width: 210px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">C: Kristian Buus</P></DIV><P>Meanwhile yesterday afternoon, activists from the group, BP or not BP? dropped an eleven-metre floor-to-balcony banner refelcting the 2,727 oil spills caused by BP’s Russian partner, Rosneft, in a single region in just one year in the British Museum.</P><P>Performers then showered thousands of paper “oil drops” from balcony in the iconic Great Court to protest against the final day of the BP-sponsored Scythians exhibition, held in partnership with the Russian State Hermitage Museum.</P><P><A href=""https://bp-or-not-bp.org/2018/01/14/we-drop-huge-banner-and-thousands-of-oil-drops-in-bp-sponsored-british-museum/"">Helen Glynn</A>, who took part in the performance, said: “BP is deeply embedded in this Russian oil giant, which is well-known as one of the most corrupt and polluting in the world. So why has the British Museum allowed BP to sponsor an exhibition of artefacts from the very regions and cultures that the company is putting at risk?”</P><P>She added: “This week, the New York Mayor announced that the city is suing BP and four other oil companies for the climate change damage they have caused. The British Museum faces huge reputational risks by continuing to promote and defend a company so toxic that one of the world’s richest cities has now turned against it.”</P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1.0,1.0,Strongly Negative

This Report presents the Consolidated Financial Statements of Shell (pages 137–178), the Parent Company Financial Statements of Shell (pages 199–207) and the Financial Statements of the <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> Dividend Access Trust (pages 213–216). Cross references to Form 20-F are set out on pages 02–03 of this Report.</P><P>Financial reporting terms used in this Report are in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. “Subsidiaries” and “Shell subsidiaries” refer to those entities over which the Company has control, either directly or indirectly. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as “joint ventures” and “joint operations” respectively, and entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as “associates”. “Joint ventures” and “joint operations” are collectively referred to as “joint arrangements”.</P><P>In addition to the term “Shell”, in this Report “we”, “us” and “our” are also used to refer to the Company and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement. The companies in which <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> plc has a direct or indirect interest are separate legal entities. Shell subsidiaries’ data include their interests in joint operations.</P><P>We also refer to “Shell’s net <mark>carbon</mark> footprint” in this Report.

Shell only controls its own emissions but, to support society in achieving the Paris Agreement goals, we aim to help and influence such suppliers and consumers to likewise lower theirs. The use of the terminology “Shell’s net <mark>carbon</mark> footprint” is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell or its subsidiaries.</P><P>Except where indicated, the figures shown in the tables in this Report are in respect of subsidiaries only, without deduction of any non-controlling interest. However, the term “Shell share” is used for convenience to refer to the volumes of hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s that are produced, processed or sold through subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. All of a subsidiary’s production, processing or sales volumes (including the share of joint operations) are included in the Shell share, even if Shell owns less than 100% of the subsidiary. In the case of joint ventures and associates, however, Shell-share figures are limited only to Shell’s entitlement. In all cases, royalty payments in kind are deducted from the Shell share.</P><P>The financial statements contained in this Report have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. As applied to the financial statements, there are no material differences from IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB); therefore, the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. IFRS as defined above includes interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee.</P><P>Except where indicated, the figures shown in this Report are stated in US dollars.

	Can development organizations be more agile and adaptable in a context of constant change?
</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV>
Constrained by an ageing model of “North-South” assistance and linear thinking, development organizations are finding it increasingly difficult to cope with the complexities and interconnectedness of global challenges, from <mark>climate change</mark> to communicable diseases. However, the convergence of three trends promises a structural change in the way development organizations operate: new ways of framing development problems (complexity theory), new information technologies and new types of coalitions. How can development organizations reform themselves to become more effective at improving the world?<P><STRONG>Development organizations exist to help reduce poverty and inequality, and improve human well-being. These problems are becoming increasingly complex as the world grows more connected and volatile.</STRONG> Cross-border flows of goods, services, people and ideas are expanding. Shocks and crises, whether social, political, economic or environmental, are increasingly frequent. As issues become more interconnected and uncertain, the outcomes of development interventions are harder to predict or explain and it is less possible for one actor alone to get things done.</P><P><STRONG>Despite these changes, the operating model of development organizations is constrained by its legacy.</STRONG> This includes centralized assistance from “developed” country governments to “developing” country governments and practices that largely rely on linear models to understand risk and to plan, execute and evaluate action. </P><P>Can development organizations be more agile and adaptable in today’s context of constant change? The combination of three trends that can help frame, understand and respond to complex problems differently offers an opportunity. </P><P><STRONG>First, complexity theory is shifting attention from linear cause and effect relationships to dynamic processes of change.</STRONG> Complexity theory has been used in physics and ecology to study how systems adapt to their environment and cope with uncertainty. Many development scholars argue that complexity theory can strengthen development organizations’ ability to understand dynamic and interconnected development problems and respond more appropriately.</P><P>In <I>Aid on the Edge of Chaos</I>, Ben Ramalingam shows how this approach can be applied to household food security. Traditionally, most of the work concentrated on predicting the occurrence of a food crisis in order to best respond. Analysing and modelling food systems and the multiple connections between socio-economic and ecological factors that contribute to their stability helped create an understanding of households’ capacity to respond to the negative effects of unpredictable climatic shocks. Analysing these variables, which change over time, can support policies to strengthen household resilience and adapt aid interventions more strategically in crisis situations.</P><P><STRONG>Second, new technologies are opening the door to understanding and anticipating complex development problems through the so-called “data revolution”.</STRONG> New types of data and analytical tools have the potential to provide real-time information on complex situations or sudden change and enable quick feedback loops to inform planning and adjust operations. They can also be used to collect citizens’ voices and feedback and integrate them in programme design. </P><P>For instance, mTrac, a Ugandan platform supported by UNICEF, the World Health Organization and the UK Department for International Development (DFID), surveys local health workers via mobile phone text messaging and then alerts national public health officials about malaria outbreaks and medicine stock situations to anticipate and resolve shortages. The share of health facilities that have run out of malaria treatments has fallen from 80% to 15% since it was introduced. The platform also includes an anonymous text message hotline that citizens can use to report any service delivery problems they face. </P><P><STRONG>Third, new kinds of coalitions and movements are emerging as the multiplication of development actors provides opportunities to redefine partnerships.</STRONG> A growing number of actors operating in the development space, from businesses and municipal governments to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and communities, are starting to figure out how to work together on a voluntary basis to solve specific issues. These coalitions of diverse actors bring information, expertise and funding together in ways that cut across domains, geographies and interests. This can lead to new solutions to old problems, e.g. by presenting development challenges as investment opportunities. </P><P>Examples of such projects already delivering results include the <I>Scaling Up Nutrition </I>(SUN) initiative. SUN brings NGOs, businesses and the UN together to accelerate global efforts on under-nutrition. Organized in a global network, each group of actors supports national efforts to improve nutrition by providing funds and expertise. For actors engaged in the SUN initiative, improving nutrition for women and children is no longer only a moral objective, it is also a way to strengthen the workforce and thus contribute to the growth of markets and nations alike. </P><P>None of these trends are completely new in themselves. But their confluence could transform the operating model of development organizations in ways that include more effective delivery of essential services for the poor; changing engagement with the private sector, from donation providers to partners for supply, investment and solution design; changing engagement with citizens, from intervention recipients to agents of change; enhancing knowledge and data systems co-created by a diversity of actors to inform decision-making; and a growing capacity to tackle multi-dimensional problems and operate effectively in uncertain contexts. </P><P>The opportunities presented by these changes come with challenges, notably, that of changing the culture of development organizations to encourage experimentation and value adaptive strategies. The use of big data raises issues of privacy that could, if mishandled, exacerbate discrimination and inequalities. The growing number of actors, coalitions and movements also raises leadership and coordination challenges, in particular for the intergovernmental decision-making structures created for these purposes.</P><P>However, development organizations exist to solve challenges. Leadership from within to overcome existing political and technical tensions could help mobilize these trends and make development more effective.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1.0,0.0,Neutral

It is likely to be a litmus test of the state of European integration, the EU’s credibility and the nature of EU-Russia relations.</P><H2>The antitrust charge</H2><P><mark>Gazprom</mark>, the Russian state-owned gas extractor and exporter, is accused of hindering competition on the gas market by imposing territorial restrictions in its supply contracts with eight member states (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Slovakia). These are both export bans and destination clauses requiring that gas be used in particular places. </P><P>The European Commission argues that these measures prevent the free flow of gas within the EU, and indeed in the past it has successfully challenged similar restrictions on EU markets. <mark>Gazprom</mark> is also charged with unfair pricing in Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. This pricing is possible partly through using certain formulas that link gas prices to oil products (a practice known as oil indexation), which unduly favour <mark>Gazprom</mark>. </P><P>In Bulgaria and Poland, <mark>Gazprom</mark> may also be leveraging its dominance by making gas supplies conditional on receiving unrelated concessions concerning gas transport infrastructure (demanding investments in <mark>Gazprom</mark>-promoted projects).</P><FIGURE class=""align-center ""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption"">The European Commission’s charges against <mark>Gazprom</mark>.</SPAN><SPAN class=""attribution""><A class=""source"" href=""http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-4829_en.htm"">European Commission</A></SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H2>Politics at play</H2><P>The geopolitical context within which this antitrust case comes is undeniably significant. Russia has <A href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187936651100011X"">made its gas exports a foreign policy tool</A>. It was able to divide and rule through its pricing policy (charging lower prices in the west and much inflated prices in the east) and supply cut-offs. </P><P>Russia has used its energy exports to put political and economic pressure on importing states, especially in the east, on multiple occasions. As one <A href=""http://www.foi.se/en/Search/Abstract/?rNo=FOI-R--1934--SE"">report from the Swedish Defence Research Agency</A> observed:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Russia has still not let go of the idea that the former Soviet territory belongs to Moscow. Russia clearly perceives these states as its sphere of influence where other rules or ethical norms apply than what is customary in [Western] Europe and in relation to [Western] Europe.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><H2>Litmus test for EU membership</H2><P>The investigation into <mark>Gazprom</mark> follows a formal Lithuanian complaint, one of the allegedly harmed member states. When joining the EU the new member states opened their markets to products from western Europe and agreed to pool sovereignty together in exchange for, among others benefits, the protection of EU law. </P><P>During the accession process some undertook various additional commitments, which led to their increased dependence on Russian gas imports. Lithuania, for example, <A href=""http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP-Lithuania_shuts_Ignalina_plant-0401104.html"">closed its Ignalina nuclear plant</A> and Bulgaria <A href=""http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Countries-A-F/Bulgaria/"">closed its nuclear reactors in Kozloduy</A>. </P><P>If the European Commission were to disregard this case and allow <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s practices to continue without their proper investigation, the faith in the European project would be seriously questioned in the eyes of new member states and their citizens. After all, what good is the EU if it protects only some (that is, those in the old member states)? This issue is only more relevant in light of the developments in Ukraine.</P><P>Similarly, the commission is the guardian of EU treaties. Were it to ignore such an important complaint formally brought by a government of one of the new member states, it would undermine its credibility there. By addressing any identified violations, the EC has an opportunity not only to restore competition, but also to make the EU a more united and stronger player. This potential is reflected in the Lithuanian president’s comment on <A href=""https://twitter.com/Grybauskaite_LT/status/590818345227804672"">Twitter</A>, regarding the matter:</P><H2>Acting with integrity</H2><P>There is also an external political dimension to this case. A permissive approach towards <mark>Gazprom</mark> is likely to question the European Commission’s integrity in the eyes of important partners like the US. In the past the EC did not refrain from blocking large mergers between US firms such as <A href=""http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-01-939_en.htm"">General Electric and Honeywell</A> in 2001, or imposing huge fines on US firms for violations of EU competition law, including <A href=""http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-196_en.htm"">Microsoft</A> and <A href=""http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-09-745_en.htm"">Intel</A>. A lax approach towards <mark>Gazprom</mark> would put the commission’s hard-earned political capital at risk, especially in the trans-Atlantic context.</P><P>The commission should therefore approach the <mark>Gazprom</mark> case in a business-as-usual manner, transparently and diligently adhering to its past practice. It should not stop short of addressing any identified violations, even if it were to encounter legal challenges or was faced with external pressure. It is a matter of faith in the EU rule-of-law, and the commission’s credibility. </P><P>At the same time, like in all competition cases, the commission should be open to the prospect of a settlement – a procedure which it uses effectively – in its enforcement efforts if this is of benefit to all.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",0.0,2.0,Strongly Negative

But our new study, <A href=""http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature19082"">published today in Nature</A>, reveals that warming in some regions actually began as early as the 1830s. </P><P>That is much earlier than previously thought, so our discovery redefines our understanding of when human activity began to influence our <mark>climate</mark>. </P><P>Determining when global warming began, and how quickly the planet has warmed since then, is essential for understanding how much we have altered the <mark>climate</mark> in different parts of the world. Our study helps to answer the question of whether our <mark>climate</mark> is already operating outside thresholds that are considered safe for human society and functional ecosystems. </P><P>Our findings show that warming did not develop at the same time across the planet. The tropical oceans and the Arctic were the first regions to begin warming, in the 1830s. Europe, North America and Asia followed roughly two decades later. </P><P>Surprisingly, the results show that the southern hemisphere began warming much later, with Australasia and South America starting to warm from the early 20th century. This continental-scale time lag is still evident today: while some parts of Antarctica have begun to warm, a clear warming signal over the entire continent is still not detectable. </P><P>The warming in most regions reversed what would otherwise have been a cooling trend related to high volcanic activity during the preceding centuries. </P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption"">Global warming got underway much earlier in the north.</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>By pinpointing the date when human-induced <mark>climate change</mark> started, we can then begin to work out when the warming trend broke through the boundaries of the <mark>climate</mark>’s natural fluctuations, because it takes some decades for the global warming signal to “emerge” above the natural <mark>climate</mark> variability.</P><P>According to our evidence, in all regions except for Antarctica, we are now well and truly operating in a greenhouse-influenced world. We know this because the only <mark>climate</mark> models that can reproduce the results seen in our records of past <mark>climate</mark> are those models that factor in the effect of the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide released into the atmosphere by humans.</P><P>These remarkable findings were pieced together from the most unusual of sources – not thermometers or satellites, but rather from natural <mark>climate</mark> archives. These include coral skeletons, ice cores, tree rings, cave deposits and ocean and lake sediment layers, all of which record the <mark>climate</mark> as they grow or accumulate. </P><P>These archives provide long records that extend back 500 years – well before the Industrial Revolution – and provide a critical baseline for the planet’s past <mark>climate</mark>, one that is impossible to obtain otherwise. </P><FIGURE class=""align-center zoomable""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption"">Corals can help reveal the <mark>climate</mark> of centuries past, long before weather records began.</SPAN><SPAN class=""attribution""><SPAN class=""source"">Eric Matson/AIMS</SPAN>, <SPAN class=""license"">Author provided</SPAN></SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>But why is there no clear warming fingerprint yet seen across Antarctica? The answer most likely lies in the vast Southern Ocean, which isolates the frozen continent from the warming happening elsewhere. </P><P>The westerly winds that circulate through the Southern Ocean around Antarctica keep warm air masses from lower latitudes at bay. Ozone depletion and rising greenhouse gas concentrations during the 20th century have also caused this wind barrier to get stronger. </P><P>The Southern Ocean currents that flow around Antarctica also tend to <A href=""http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v9/n7/full/ngeo2731.html"">move warmer surface waters away from the continent</A>, to be replaced with cold deeper water that hasn’t yet been affected by surface greenhouse warming. This process could potentially delay Antarctica’s warming by centuries.</P><H2>Ocean insulation</H2><P>The delay in warming observed in the rest of the southern hemisphere is something we do not yet fully understand. It could simply be because fewer records are available from the southern hemisphere, meaning that we still don’t have a full picture of what is happening. </P><P>Alternatively, like Antarctica, the southern hemisphere’s oceans could be holding back warming – partly through winds and currents, but perhaps also because of “thermal inertia”, whereby the ocean can absorb far more heat energy than the atmosphere or the land before its temperature markedly increases. Bear in mind that the southern half of the globe has much more ocean than the north.</P><P>Essentially, then, the coolness of the southern hemisphere’s vast oceans could be “insulating” Australasia and South America from the impact of global warming. The question is, for how long?</P><P>If our evidence of delayed warming in the southern hemisphere holds true, it could mean we are in in for more <mark>climate</mark> surprises as global warming begins to overcome the thermal inertia of our surrounding oceans. Could the <A href=""https://theconversation.com/this-summers-sea-temperatures-were-the-hottest-on-record-for-australia-heres-why-56906"">recent record warming of Australian waters</A>, and the <A href=""https://theconversation.com/how-will-the-barrier-reef-recover-from-the-death-of-one-third-of-its-northern-corals-60186"">subsequent damage to the Great Barrier Reef</A>, be an early sign that this is already occurring? </P><P>Recent research suggest that the mass bleaching event of the reef was made <A href=""https://theconversation.com/great-barrier-reef-bleaching-would-be-almost-impossible-without-<mark>climate</mark>-change-58408"">175 times more likely by <mark>climate change</mark></A>. Following the recent severity of such extremes, a better understanding of how anthropogenic greenhouse warming is already impacting the southern hemisphere is critical. </P><H2>What to do about it</H2><P>Leading scientists from around the world <A href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/"">met in Geneva</A> last week to discuss the goal of limiting average global warming to 1.5℃ – the more ambitious of the two targets enshrined in the <A href=""https://theconversation.com/the-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-agreement-at-a-glance-50465"">Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement</A>. </P><P>Last year, global temperatures crossed the <A href=""https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/bams"">1℃ threshold</A>, and 2016 is <A href=""http://<mark>climate</mark>.nasa.gov/news/2465/2016-<mark>climate</mark>-trends-continue-to-break-records/"">on track to be 1.2-1.3℃ above our <mark>climate</mark> baseline</A>.</P><P>But here’s the kicker. That baseline is relative to 1850–1900, when most of our thermometer-based temperature records began. What our study shows is that for many parts of the world that estimate isn’t good enough, because global warming was already under way, so the real baseline would be lower.</P><P>The small increases in greenhouse gases during the 19th century had a small effect on Earth’s temperatures, but with the longer perspective we get from our natural <mark>climate</mark> records we see that big changes occurred. These fractions of a degree of extra warming might seem insignificant at first, but as we nudge ever closer to the 1.5℃ guardrail (and <A href=""https://theconversation.com/we-have-almost-certainly-blown-the-1-5-degree-global-warming-target-63720"">potentially beyond</A>), the past tells us that <A href=""https://theconversation.com/without-a-longer-term-view-the-paris-agreement-will-lock-in-warming-for-centuries-64169"">small changes matter</A>.</P><P><EM>Helen McGregor will be online to answer your questions from 2pm AEST today.

Solutions to <mark>climate change</mark> require new types of aggressive thinking. While <A href=""http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php"">global treaties</A> to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are important, they are not enough. Eventually society has to go <mark>carbon</mark> neutral, and then it has to go <A href=""http://energy.umich.edu/research/projects/beyond-<mark>carbon</mark>-neutral""><mark>carbon</mark> negative</A>.</P><P>The ultimate responsibility for making this shift is falling first and foremost on business. Companies are developing the next buildings we live and work in, the clothes we wear, the food we eat, the forms of mobility we employ and the energy systems that propel them. With their unmatched powers of ideation, production and distribution, business is the only entity that can bring the change we need. Indeed, if there are no solutions coming from the business world, there will be no solutions at the necessary scale. </P><P>While business has been addressing sustainability challenges <A href=""http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=3692"">since the 1990s</A>, and <mark>climate change</mark> since the 2000s, the focus of this effort is now at an inflection point, as Toyota’s “beyond zero impact” effort shows. Rather than looking to government for solutions, many businesses are taking responsibility for <mark>climate change</mark> seriously and changing the system on their own. </P><H2>Business sustainability 1.0: Enterprise integration</H2><P>Over the past quarter-century, companies have framed environmental sustainability as a market shift that fits into the existing ways of managing a business, an approach that we at the <A href=""http://erb.umich.edu/"">Erb Institute</A> call Enterprise Integration. The notion is that <A href=""https://www.amazon.com/Competitive-Environmental-Strategy-Changing-Landscape/dp/1559637722"">key business constituents</A> bring sustainability to the business through existing corporate functions, thereby making it a strategic concern. </P><P>For example, <A href=""http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/ajhoff/books/2006%20Pew%20Report.pdf"">Whirlpool</A> is innovating on appliance energy efficiency, not because of corporate social responsibility, but because it has watched energy efficiency move from number 10 or 12 in consumer priorities in the 1980s to number three, behind cost and performance.

Once insurance companies apply sustainability pressures on the business, the issue becomes one of risk management. From competitors, it becomes an issue of strategic direction. From investors and banks, it becomes an issue of capital acquisition and cost of capital. From suppliers and buyers, it becomes an issue of supply chain logistics. From consumers, it becomes an issue of market demand.  </P><P>Put in such terms, much of the specific language of sustainability recedes, being replaced by the core language of standard business strategy. As such, companies can remain agnostic about the science of particular issues (such as <mark>climate change</mark>) but still recognize their importance as business concerns. In doing so, they are turning the false dichotomy between the economy and the environment on its head.</P><P>Indeed, recent surveys show that <A href=""http://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/sustainabilitys-next-frontier/"">85 percent</A> of business executives believe that <mark>climate change</mark> is real (well above the national average of <A href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/190010/concern-global-warming-eight-year-high.aspx"">64 percent</A>) and more than <A href=""https://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/news_events/8.1/UNGC_Accenture_CEO_Study_2010.pdf"">90 percent</A> of CEOs believe that sustainability in general is important to a company’s profits. This leads more businesses to develop sustainability strategies, create positions like <A href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/hbsworkingknowledge/2014/10/08/what-do-chief-sustainabilty-officers-do/#5ebdb2ef1a96"">chief sustainability officer</A> to carry them out and publish <A href=""https://www.globalreporting.org/Pages/default.aspx"">annual reports</A> on sustainability to track and share the results. This is the first model of business sustainability and it would seem to be setting us on a path to becoming more <mark>sustainable</mark>.</P><P>But, not so fast.</P><P>As promising as these developments are, our world continues to become less, not more, <mark>sustainable</mark>, and the nature of the problems we face are markedly different than they were in the 1990s. To mark this shift, scientists have proposed that we have left the Holocene and entered the <A href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v415/n6867/full/415023a.html"">Anthropocene</A>, a new geologic epoch that acknowledges that humans are now a <A href=""https://theconversation.com/an-official-welcome-to-the-anthropocene-epoch-but-who-gets-to-decide-its-here-57113"">significant operating force within the Earth’s ecosystems</A>. </P><P>Recognition of the Anthropocene has broad implications for how we think about business sustainability. Rather than fitting sustainability into the existing models of the market, we must now recognize that the market is taking control of natural systems with potentially catastrophic consequences. <mark>Climate change</mark>, ozone depletion, droughts, wildfires, food insecurity, water scarcity and the social unrest that results all point to a fundamental system failure created by our market (and political) institutions. </P><P>As a result, the first phase of business sustainability – integrating these practices within core corporate functions –  is inadequate for the scope of the issues we now face. Using this model, we are slowing the velocity at which we are approaching a <A href=""https://theconversation.com/to-manage-earth-in-the-anthropocene-we-need-to-focus-on-systems-change-38452"">system collapse</A>, but we are not averting that eventual outcome. A new model of thinking is emerging. </P><H2>Sustainability 2.0: Market transformation</H2><P>The next mode of business sustainability, which we call market transformation, involves corporations making <A href=""http://yalebooks.com/book/9780300158434/sustainability-design"">systemic changes</A> in the business environment. It sees the corporation as a positive force in society, ameliorating our legacy of harm and mitigating the impacts from a global population expected to reach nine billion by 2050. </P><P>We can already see some of the <A href=""https://theconversation.com/capitalism-must-evolve-to-solve-the-<mark>climate</mark>-crisis-47338"">elements of this shift</A> coming into view. Here are some core tenets of this change to creating sustainability: </P><UL><LI><P>Focus on the <A href=""http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=22399"">system</A>. The notion of an energy company installing a windfarm and calling itself <mark>sustainable</mark> makes no empirical sense. A more <mark>sustainable</mark> energy system incorporates the whole grid, encompassing generation, transmission, distribution, use and mobility. <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/06/technology/google-says-it-will-run-entirely-on-renewable-energy-in-2017.html"">Google</A>, for example, plans to run all of its data centers entirely from renewable energy by 2017.  This goes far beyond a token commitment, creating a hedge against <A href=""https://www.ceres.org/resources/reports/power-forward-why-the-world2019s-largest-companies-are-investing-in-renewable-energy/view"">future energy volatility</A> by changing the overall energy system on which the company depends.</P></LI><LI><P>Involve the entire supply chain. Systemic approaches to business sustainability require a broader consideration of operations and supply chain logistics, using concepts such as <A href=""http://css.snre.umich.edu/"">life cycle analysis</A>, <A href=""http://cie.research.yale.edu/"">industrial ecology</A> and the <A href=""https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/circular-economy/overview/concept"">circular economy</A> to reduce material and energy use among all the constituents in the supply chain.</P></LI><LI><P>The government as collaborator. Since the days of Adam Smith, government has been the <A href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602490/capitalism-behaving-badly/"">arbiter of the market</A>, helping to set the rules in the service of humans and adapting to changes as needed. You can’t price-fix, you can’t collude, you can’t sell drugs; we accept these as rules of the market. In the future, the market will restrict (or eliminate) the emission of greenhouse gases as a way to promote economic growth, not hinder it. Forward-thinking companies seek ways to constructively participate in policy formation.</P></LI><LI><P>Questioning our standard models and metrics. Ultimately, market transformation is prompting a reexamination of the models now used to understand and explain the market, such as <A href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/long-term-capitalism/redefining-capitalism"">neoclassical economics</A> and <A href=""https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-problem-of-corporate-purpose/"">principal-agent theory</A>. Both of these are built on rather dismal simplifications of human beings as largely untrustworthy and driven by avarice, greed and short-term thinking. Anyone in business will tell you that their motivations and resultant strategies are far more complex. For example, some, like former GE CEO Jack Welch, are questioning the assumption that <A href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2013/06/26/the-origin-of-the-worlds-dumbest-idea-milton-friedman/#205a8e58214c"">the singular purpose of the corporation</A> is to make money for its shareholders.  </P></LI><LI><P>As these models are questioned, new ones are emerging, from <A href=""http://capitalinstitute.org/regenerative-capitalism/"">regenerative capitalism</A> to <A href=""http://www.collaborativeconsumption.com/"">collaborative consumption</A>, from <A href=""http://www.conflictfreesourcing.org/"">conflict-free sourcing</A> to the <A href=""http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21573104-internet-everything-hire-rise-sharing-economy"">sharing economy</A>.</P></LI></UL><H2>Different from the Reagan years</H2><P>These are just some of the emergent notions of a new framework for corporate sustainability. Companies are altering the systems in which they operate, driving entire industries toward a set of market rules that bring us toward a <mark>sustainable</mark> future. </P><P>So, while President-elect Trump’s approach to the EPA bears similarities to <A href=""https://theconversation.com/<mark>climate</mark>-change-and-the-presidential-race-lessons-from-the-reagan-years-66194"">President Reagan</A>‘s attempts to roll back environmental regulations in the 1980s, and likely faces a similar backlash, there is one big difference; some of that backlash will come from businesses who are leading on greenhouse gas reductions and renewable energy and not fighting government-led environmental policies as they did in the 1980s. To get a sense of the shifting economic landscape, <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-25/clean-energy-jobs-surpass-oil-drilling-for-first-time-in-u-s"">jobs in the clean energy sector</A> exceeded those in oil drilling for the first time in 2016 and continue to grow.  Indeed, many within these and other sectors are <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/01/<mark>climate</mark>-change-donald-trump-us-companies?CMP=share_btn_tw"">already pushing back</A> on Trump’s dismissal of <mark>climate change</mark> and continuing with strategies of their own.</P><P>They will do this with, or <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/08/us/politics/trump-<mark>climate</mark>-epa-coal-jobs.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news"">without</A>, the cooperation of governments and their political shifts back and forth on these critical issues. </P><P>For example, Toyota, in its effort to go <mark>carbon</mark>-neutral, must think systemically and include many partners, just as Tesla is doing as it challenges the calculus for electric cars sector-wide. To enact system-wide change, companies are also working with governments to <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/17/business/how-the-chemical-industry-joined-the-fight-against-<mark>climate</mark>-change.html?_r=0"">phase out heat-trapping HFC chemicals</A>, set <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/17/business/energy-environment/epa-truck-emission-standards.html"">new efficiency standards on trucks</A>, establish transparency <A href=""http://wdi-publishing.com/casedetail.aspx?cid=1429411"">rules on conflict minerals</A> or participate in negotiations on a global <mark>climate change</mark> agreement. Examples of companies doing it on their own include changes in the <A href=""http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-08-24/michelin-isnt-reinventing-wheel-its-reinventing-rubber-supply-chain"">supply chain on rubber</A> or the reduction (even elimination) of <A href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/meat-companies-go-antibiotics-free-as-more-consumers-demand-it-1415071802"">antibiotics in chicken</A>.  </P><P>In each of these cases, companies are stepping into, in the words of Unilever CEO Paul Polman, “<A href=""http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/mt-interview-paul-polman-unilever/article/1055793"">a very interesting period in history</A> where the responsible business world is running ahead of the politicians” and taking on a broader role to “<A href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability-and-resource-productivity/our-insights/business-society-and-the-future-of-capitalism%20%22%22"">serve society</A>.”</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1.0,1.0,Positive

Out of these applications electrical motors are having the highest share of electrical energy use, about 53 per cent. By 2030 the number of transformers and motors needed is expected to grow considerably. Most of the older motors and transformer products in use today and many of the new ones being sold waste electricity. This leaves less money for citizens, businesses, and governments to spend on other priorities. It also worsens air <mark>pollution</mark> and strains electricity grids. As a Partner in United for Efficiency, <mark>ABB</mark> is helping developing and emerging countries adopt energy efficiency policies to transform their markets to high performance motors and transformers.</P><P>The energy savings potential is enormous. For example, the best transformers can reduce energy losses by up to 60 per cent. Optimised motor systems can yield energy improvements of 20 to 30 per cent.</P><P><mark>ABB</mark>, a global market and technology leader in motors and transformers, is a longstanding Partner of United for Efficiency.

But the drive to make biofuels from crops is driving up the price of grains worldwide.</P><P>Last year, Mexicans struggled to pay for their staple food - the corn bread, tortilla.</P><P>Total Environment Centre spokesman Leigh Martin says adverse effects on the environment must be avoided in the drive for biofuel creation.</P><P>&quot;We need to make sure that diversion of crops into the creation of ethanol doesn't simply drive up fuel prices and that we don't create other global warming problems by clearing vegetation to create crops for generating ethanol,&quot; he said.</P><H3>Biofuel concerns</H3><P>The European Union, which has set a 10 per cent biofuel target, is increasingly concerned about the wholesale clearance of rainforests in Indonesia, Brazil and Latin America to make way for biofuel crops.</P><P>Mr Kaye says In a greenhouse-constrained world where there are difficulties with agriculture, putting pressure on food supplies should be avoided.</P><P>&quot;The last thing we want to do is put transport in competition with food supply, and that's precisely what bioethanol will do,&quot; he said.</P><P>Here in Australia, it is mostly wheat being grown for ethanol and now there is a car to fit - a GM Saab that runs on 85 per cent ethanol.</P><P>The fuel to power it will be on sale in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane.</P><P>A recent CSIRO study predicted that if all currently exported wheat was used to make ethanol, it would replace between 11 per cent and 22 per cent of petrol used.</P><P>But Australia would be forced to import wheat in drought years.</P><P>Senator Carr says there are many issues that need addressing.</P><P>&quot;There are issues that relate to the question of the uses of land supply, there are questions that relate to whether fuel or food is produced from the crops that are available, there are new technologies,&quot; he said.</P><P>&quot;However that mean coming on board, which means that we are able to think about different ways in which we can produce biofuels into the future.&quot;</P><H3>Hybrid cars</H3><P>More than a million new cars hit Australia's roads last year, the most popular still, the six-cylinder Holden Commodore.</P><P>But a small and growing proportion, just under 4,000, were imported petrol-electric hybrids.</P><P>They have batteries that charge on the road and use around 50 per cent less fuel.</P><P>Unlike most other drivers, Jacqueline McCann can still laugh when the talk turns to petrol prices.</P><P>&quot;It's very, very cheap to run, I probably fill it up once every three weeks and it's a nice stylish car. It's smooth to drive, it's got everything I need,&quot; she said.</P><P>&quot;[I'm] making a lot of savings on petrol and you can't be unhappy about that.'</P><P>The fully electric car is on the drawing boards of the big car makers.</P><P>US General Motors chief executive Rick Wagoner says they are inevitable.</P><P>&quot;So are electrically-driven vehicles the answer for the mid and long term? For sure,&quot; he said.</P><P>But the future electric plug-in cars will only be as clean as their sources of energy.</P><H3>Cleaner energy</H3><P>Australia relies overwhelmingly on coal, unless it shifts to cleaner sources of electricity, the electric plug-in car would be a step backwards in terms of <mark>CO2</mark> emissions.</P><P>Dr Kaye says a transformation of the transport system in Australia from gasoline based to electricity generated by coal would cause an 18 million tonne a year increase in the nation's greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P>Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries spokesman Andrew McKeller says there are important challenges ahead.</P><P>&quot;In terms of the future of coal-fired power stations and clean coal, other sources of electricity, those are important challenges that have to be addressed as part of the overall solution,&quot; he said.</P><P>The Holy Grail is the hydrogen powered car.</P><P>BMW showed off its prototype in Melbourne on Thursday.</P><P>The company says governments must develop the solar and wind energy sources to drive the creation of hydrogen from sea water.</P><P>BMW spokesman Guenther Seemann says the company has shown the way forward.</P><P>&quot;If you want to clap hands you need two hands, right?&quot; he said.</P><P>&quot;From our part we showed that a car manufacturer is able to produce an engine with zero emission.</P><P>&quot;The other side is the total infrastructure which is needed to run such cars and this [something] a car company cannot do alone.&quot;</P><H3>Australian cars</H3><P>But Australian car makers are yet to progress in the race to the clean, green car.</P><P>General Motors Holden unveiled a prototype for an electric-petrol car in 2000, but the project stalled.</P><P>Today, it is a Sydney Museum piece.</P><P>The Federal Government is encouraging local manufacturers to go green.</P><P>It will give the industry up to $500 million through its green car <mark>innovation</mark> fund.</P><P>&quot;There are plans under way now to introduce a whole range of new technologies, a whole range of new capabilities,&quot; Mr McKeller said.</P><P>Senator Carr says Australian motor companies will rise to the challenge faced by <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>&quot;In my judgment, we will see new technologies emerge in Australia,&quot; he said.</P><P>&quot;We want to do all we can to encourage the commercialisation of those technologies, so that Australians do have the options to drive Australian made, green cars.&quot;</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,1.0,Positive

Climate change is shaking up everything from finance to health. As a result, it isn’t only urban planners in at-risk areas who will have to shift their framework for planning for the future.

In the same way tech has transformed today’s workforce, some say that climate change could transform tomorrow’s.  </P><P>One industry that already shows some of that evolution is energy. According to data provided by job listings search engine <A href=""http://www.indeed.com/"">Indeed</A>, in the first quarter of 2014 in the UK, job postings in the renewable energy sector – made up of bioenergy, geothermal, hydroelectric, solar, and wind – accounted for a third (32.9%) of all energy-sector job postings in the first quarter of 2014. In 2017, that had risen to over half of all energy sector job postings, or 51.5%.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P> Our civil engineers haven’t been trained to deal with climate change in their training. Our urban planners, our city managers, our architects. Nobody’s been taught this stuff - Daniel Kreeger </P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Although these numbers are UK-specific, the same pattern of a shift to renewables was seen worldwide, says Tara Sinclair, Indeed’s senior fellow and an economist at George Washington University.</P><P>Those changes have been the result of a variety of factors, including the fall in oil prices and <A href=""http://www.newsweek.com/coal-industry-dying-no-matter-trump-507079"">competitiveness of natural gas</A>: over the same three years, job postings for oil and coal in the UK fell from two-thirds (66.5%) of the energy sector to under half (47.7%).</P><P>But it’s also a result of how both employers and job-seekers are becoming interested in mitigating emissions and climate change, says Sinclair. After oil prices declined several years ago, she says, jobs in the oil industry dropped off, as did job-seekers’ interest in them.</P><P>“Part of it is there are fewer opportunities, and people respond to that they know what the landscape of the labour market is, broadly,” she says. “But also there does seem to be this increasing attractiveness of green economy jobs.”</P><P>In the same way that many people from the oil and gas industry have been able to transition into green energy, says Sinclair, many employees already should have skills which are transferable to climate change-specific issues.

I don’t think that as new skill we haven’t seen before.”</P><DIV class=""inline-media inline-image""><A data-replace-url="""" data-anchor-title=""Climate change"" data-caption=""Seawalls are being built and repaired in coastal areas that face rising sea levels due to climate change - which requires able-bodied workers (Credit: Alamy Stock Photo)"" data-caption-title="""" data-replace-image=""true"" data-is-portrait=""false"" class=""replace-image"" title=""Climate change "" href=""http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/wm/live/624_351/images/live/p0/57/vv/p057vvv5.jpg"">

    </A></DIV><P><STRONG>Money talks</STRONG></P><P>It remains to be seen how much climate change will affect the expected skill sets for employees in industries less immediately affected by climate change than, say, civil engineering or catastrophe bonds.</P><P>But even companies in industries that would appear to be less directly affected by climate change are tuning into the issue.</P><P>Winston, who consults with a variety of businesses to help them get ahead of global trends – one of which is climate change – points to Unilever. The mega-corporation, which makes everything from Dove soap to Magnum ice cream, <A href=""https://www.unilever.com/sustainable-living/values-and-values/"">has pledged serious action on a variety of sustainability initiatives</A>– including <A href=""https://www.unilever.com/sustainable-living/reducing-environmental-impact/greenhouse-gases/our-carbon-positive-ambition/#244-423341"">sourcing 100% of its energy</A> for production from renewable sources by 2030 (it already cut its carbon emissions by 43% from 2008 to 2016). Other companies are working on similarly ambitious initiatives: Coca-Cola, Ikea and Walmart also have committed to 100% renewable energy.</P><P>If it seems odd that companies seem to be talking the kind of talk heard more at NGOs, <A href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35430228"">it shouldn’t</A>. For one, it appeals to consumers. <A href=""http://www.conecomm.com/research-blog/2017-csr-study"">Recent research</A> by Cone Communications, a PR agency for consumer brands, found that 87% of Americans said they would purchase a product because of a company’s alignment on an issue they cared about. It also attracts would-be workers: <A href=""http://www.conecomm.com/research-blog/2016-millennial-employee-engagement-study"">nearly two-thirds of millennials</A>– the generation that will make up half of all US employees by 2020 – said they take a company’s social and environmental commitments into account when weighing a job offer.</P><P>But it isn’t just about brand appeal. As Unilever outlines on its site, cutting waste and energy use, for example, means cutting both costs and exposure to price volatility. (The company says it already has shaved €700 million in costs since 2008 in this area alone).</P><P>Corporate interest in climate change mitigation is also, of course, out of concern for global economic health. <A href=""http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1010539514568711"">One 2016 study</A> found that simply the effect of rising temperatures on workers’ productivity, particularly in already-warm climates like Asia and Africa, could cost the global economy more than $2 trillion by 2030.</P><P>“The change in discussions in corporate boardrooms, and companies in general, on climate has been pretty profound,” says Winston. “There isn’t a large company in the world that isn’t talking about sustainability or climate. It’s just not possible to operate your business without talking about this.”</P><P>Those factors may help explain why <A href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40116301"">executives of companies from Goldman Sachs to Facebook expressed anger</A> at President Trump’s announcement to withdraw the US from the Paris Climate Agreement. Some US CEOs, including Walt Disney’s Bob Iger and Tesla’s Elon Musk, <A href=""https://qz.com/997738/all-the-ceos-who-are-staying-on-trumps-elite-advisory-board-after-the-paris-climate-decision/"">resigned from the president’s advisory board</A> in protest.</P><P>Another signifier of how much corporations are not only taking climate change seriously, but also valuing climate-related skills, is in the salaries they’re paying people with that kind of expertise.</P><P>In 2016, <A href=""https://crsalarysurvey.com/"">a survey of employees</A> working in the corporate responsibility and sustainability sector, most of whom were in North America or Europe, found that the average salary was £61,000 ($87,000 in 2016 values); 12% of respondents earned £100,000 ($143,000) or more. Even in the UK, where the average salary was under that at £57,000, the average corporate responsibility professional pulled in twice the amount of the average full-time UK employee –<A href=""https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/annualsurveyofhoursandearnings/2016provisionalresults#average-earnings"">who in 2016 made £28,000.</A></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P> Another signifier of how much corporations are not only taking climate change seriously, but also valuing climate-related skills, is in the salaries they’re paying people with that kind of expertise </P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Still, 63% of the same professionals in the study had a master’s or doctorate. “Frankly, they are underpaid relative to the expertise and value that they offer,” writes director of SystemiQ Jeremy Oppenheim in the study. One explanation, he says, is that “not enough companies still fully appreciate the economic value which the sustainability team brings to their business.”</P><P>Similarly, says Winston, in their search for potential employees, most human resources departments, particularly in the US, seem to be behind in terms of how much they are weighing potential employees’ climate change competencies. “It’s lagging given the scale of the challenge. That’s because, for so many years, people thought it was political. You wouldn’t get in trouble saying ‘Hey, everyone should be trained in social media’, but you could if you were saying, ‘Hey, everyone should be trained in climate change,” he says.</P><P>“But,” Winston adds, “that’s changing.” And that shift is already happening, he says – with or without US participation in the Paris Agreement.</P><P> --</P><P><EM>Join 800,000+ Future fans by liking us on </EM><A href=""https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture""><STRONG><EM>Facebook</EM></STRONG></A><EM>, or follow us on </EM><A href=""https://twitter.com/bbc_future""><STRONG><EM>Twitter</EM></STRONG></A><EM>.</EM></P><P><EM>If you liked this story, </EM><A href=""http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/?ocid=fut.bbc.email.we.email-signup""><STRONG><EM>sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter</EM></STRONG></A><EM>, called “If You Only Read 6 Things This Week”.

BP,</EM><A name=""_ftnref1"" href=""#_ftn1"">[1]</A>  Judge Alsup fired questions about global warming and <mark>climate change</mark> at plaintiffs and defendants alike.  The local governments have alleged that five major energy companies created a public nuisance by extracting and promoting the sale of fossil fuels with the knowledge that such products caused global warming.</P><P>Only one of the defendants’ attorneys spoke at the tutorial.  Counsel for <mark>Chevron</mark> accepted the general scientific consensus that humans are primarily responsible for <mark>climate change</mark>.  However, focusing extensively on a 2013 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, <mark>Chevron</mark>’s lawyer highlighted uncertainties surrounding the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, including sea level rise. </P><P>The cities called several experts to present their side to the court.  Myles Allen, head of the <mark>Climate</mark> Dynamics group at the University of Oxford, asserted that science has recognized since the 1950’s the effects and sources of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere.  University of California at Santa Cruz professor Gary Griggs and University of Illinois professor Don Wuebbles outlined the increasing rate of sea level rise.</P><P>Judge Alsup, who has employed tutorials in other complex scientific cases, indicated at the end of the hearing that the remaining defendant companies, who have objected to the court’s personal jurisdiction, had two weeks to file written statements agreeing with or refuting points made by <mark>Chevron</mark>’s counsel.<A name=""_ftnref2"" href=""#_ftn2""><SPAN>[2]</SPAN></A>  </P><P><STRONG>Motions to Dismiss – San Francisco/Oakland Cases</STRONG></P><P>A day before the tutorial, defendants in the Oakland and San Francisco cases filed several motions to dismiss the lawsuits.<A name=""_ftnref3"" href=""#_ftn3""><SPAN>[3]</SPAN></A>  The primary motion, filed by <mark>Chevron</mark> and joined by the other defendants, centered on an argument that the Clean Air Act displaced the plaintiffs’ claims. </P><P>Defendants argued that, despite the focus of the cities’ claims on the production and sale of fossil fuels, not the eventual combustion of those fuels, the court should hold that the “domestic portions” of plaintiffs’ claims at least are displaced under <EM>AEP v.

Across North America, <A href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-says-238-cities-are-competing-for-hq2-2017-10""> more than 200</A> cities, states, and regions submitted bids. </P><P> In their proposals, the cities in the running laid out why Amazon should pick them, from their large populations to their skilled tech workforces. <A href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-hq2-top-cities-according-to-moodys-data-2017-10""> Moody's Analytics</A>, <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/09/upshot/where-should-amazon-new-headquarters-be.html""> The New York Times</A>, <A href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-new-headquarters-sterlings-study-predicts-top-13-places-for-hq2-2017-11/#no-13-san-jose-california-1""> Sperling's</A>, and <A href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/20/these-cities-may-win-war-for-amazons-new-headquarters.html""> CNBC</A> (among others) have each made their own predictions of the top contenders based on Amazon's specifications. Respectively, they are Austin, Texas; Denver, Colorado; Atlanta, Georgia; and Raleigh, North Carolina. All of these cities made the cut as finalists. </P><P> Though their HQ2 proposals are not fully public, none of these cities — nor Amazon in its RFP — have openly mentioned the possible ramifications of <mark>climate change</mark> on HQ2. As The Huffington Post's Alexander Kaufman <A href=""https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amazon-hq-search-<mark>climate</mark>-effect_us_5a32eac6e4b0ff955ad15345""> notes</A>, <mark>climate change</mark>-linked events like sea-level rise, hurricanes, and heat waves could affect HQ2's employees and infrastructure in coming years. </P><P> Amazon — as well as city officials from Atlanta and Denver — did not respond to a request to comment.

Denver can also expect to see more frequent and dangerous heat wave, droughts, and wildfires by the mid-21st century, according to a 2017 <A href=""http://wwa.colorado.edu/<mark>climate</mark>/<mark>co2</mark>015vulnerability/co_vulnerability_report_2015_final.pdf""> CU-Boulder and Colorado State University report.</A></P><P><A href=""http://www.ajc.com/news/key-impacts-<mark>climate</mark>-change-georgia/ibsmH4R4QQtdsAMOnlovtK/""> Atlanta</A><A href=""http://www.ajc.com/news/key-impacts-<mark>climate</mark>-change-georgia/ibsmH4R4QQtdsAMOnlovtK/""> already experiences</A> extensive droughts and has seen increases in the number of days with temperatures exceeding 95 degrees, largely due to <mark>climate change</mark>.

A number of waterfront cities that submitted bids already face the risk of flooding and power outages during storm surges. </P><P> In urban areas, <mark>climate change</mark> resilience is only going to become a bigger consideration for companies, which depend on their workforces not being hampered by frequent natural disasters. Over the summer, many businesses in the Houston area shut down for several days due to Hurricane Harvey, The Wall Street Journal <A href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/most-houston-businesses-closed-as-harveys-rains-continue-1503954068""> reported</A>. Gas prices also <A href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/hurricane-harvey-economic-impact-2017-8/""> rose</A> in the state following Harvey, which likely made deliveries via diesel trucks more expensive. </P><P> The contenders for HQ2 listed all sorts of reasons why Amazon should pick them. New Jersey said it will grant Amazon <A href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-headquarters-hq2-new-jersey-economic-incentive-2017-10""> $7 billion</A> in tax cuts, while Columbus, Ohio is offering Amazon nearly <A href=""http://radio.wosu.org/post/lure-amazon-columbus-promises-tax-breaks-and-transit-investment#stream/0""> $2.3 billion</A> in incentives.

Apple issued a $1 billion bond on Tuesday with special rules: the proceeds it raises must be used on eco-friendly projects. <P> The proceeds from the bonds will be used for several projects, including new and ongoing solar and wind farms, new green buildings, and a program that seeks to make Apple products using only recycled or renewable materials. </P><P> This is the second so-called &quot;green bond&quot; that Apple has issued. Last year, Apple raised $1.5 billion in a green bond sale. Apple is now the largest issuer of dollar-denominated green bonds. </P><P> Goldman Sachs, BofA Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan were the bookrunners. This year's notes mature in 2027. </P><P> According to the bond prospectus, Apple has issued $99 billion in debt. It had $256.8 billion in cash at through its second quarter of 2017. </P><H2> Big in bonds </H2><P> Green bonds are intended to make it easier for investors to identify environmentally-friendly projects, and the proceeds will follow a set of guidelines called the Green Bond Principles. </P><P> Projects funded from the the bond proceeds will be approved by Lisa Jackson, Apple's VP of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. </P><P> Currently, 96% of Apple's electricity comes from renewable sources, and Apple has invested in solar farms and hydroelectric plants around the world. </P><P> The bond offering also has a specific focus on Apple's stated goal of a &quot;closed-loop supply chain,&quot; which means that Apple is seeking to make products using only renewable or recycled materials. </P><P> &quot;This means Apple will be investigating ways to build products using only renewable resources or recycled materials, and will be pursuing ways to better recover and recycle materials from its products,&quot; according to a oversight document from Sustainalytics commissioned by Apple.</P><P> Apple's green bond is the first US green bond issued since President Trump announced he intended to withdraw the US from the Paris accords. </P><P> Green bonds are just a small proportion of Apple's borrowing strategy. Apple issues debt so it doesn't have to use offshore cash to spend on these projects, which would mean that Apple would pay taxes on those reserves. </P></DIV></SECTION></SECTION></SECTION></SECTION></SECTION></BODY></HTML>",2.0,2.0,Positive

At the epicenter are hedge fund millionaire <STRONG>Nathaniel Simons</STRONG>, his wife <STRONG>Laura Baxter-Simons</STRONG>, and their secretive Sea Change Foundation.</P><P>“Investors” become even wealthier, as billions of dollars are transferred annually to environmentalists, scientists, politicians, bureaucrats, and crony-corporatists in <A href=""http://townhall.com/columnists/pauldriessen/2015/08/22/<mark>climate</mark>-crisis-inc-n2042164"">Renewable Energy &amp; <mark>Climate</mark> Crisis, Inc</A>. The alleged “urgency” of replacing fossil fuels with “eco-friendly renewable energy” (to prevent catastrophic manmade <mark>climate change</mark>) drives and excuses operations that define or barely skirt “corrupt practices.”</P><P>The arrangements are too convoluted to explain in one article. Even the U.S. Senate’s “<A href=""http://www.naro-us.org/Resources/NARO%20CA/NARO-CA,%20US%20Senate%20Minority%20Report,%20Billionaires%20Club%20(1).pdf"">Billionaires’ Club</A>” report, the Environmental Policy Alliance’s “<A href=""https://www.biggreenradicals.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Klein_Report.pdf"">From Russia with Love</A>” study, and articles by investigative journalists like <STRONG><A href=""http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/the-hidden-persuaders-of-the-environmental-elite/article/2551714#!"">Ron Arnold</A></STRONG> and <STRONG>Lachlan Markay</STRONG> (<A href=""http://freebeacon.com/politics/how-dem-moneyman-nat-simons-profits-from-political-giving/"">here</A>, <A href=""http://freebeacon.com/national-security/liberal-foundation-distributed-money-from-bermuda-to-liberal-nonprofits/"">here</A>, and <A href=""http://freebeacon.com/issues/foreign-firm-funding-u-s-green-groups-tied-to-state-owned-russian-oil-company/"">here</A>) barely scratch the surface.</P><P>Washington is out of control. The IRS targeting conservative groups, Clinton Foundation and national security scandals, FBI pseudo-investigations and whitewashing, bureaucrats imposing $1.9 trillion in economy-crushing regulations that <A href=""https://info.mrc.org/COLLATERAL-DAMAGE.html"">ruin families and communities</A> – with virtually no perpetrators ever held accountable.</P><P>Here we are talking about radically and fundamentally dismantling the energy system that powers the American free enterprise, transportation, communication, and healthcare systems … replacing it with expensive, subsidized, unreliable, land-hungry wind, solar, and biofuel energy – and using vindictive government power to bankrupt and impoverish disfavored factions, while enriching favored allies.</P><P>Imagine the trillions of dollars required for the U.S. to accept the wind industry’s “vision” of 4,000,000 megawatts of electricity from <A href=""https://www.cfact.org/2016/10/21/cfact-comments-to-the-department-of-energy-on-ice-breaker-lake-erie-wind-project/"">500,000 to 1,250,000 mega-turbines</A> in our Great Lakes and along our Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico coasts. Picture the multiple trillions required to achieve <A href=""http://townhall.com/columnists/pauldriessen/2016/10/01/green-pixie-dust-energy-policies-n2226185"">50% renewable energy by 2027</A> and a “100% <mark>carbon</mark>-free economy” by 2050. Envision the potential billionaire profits!</P><P>As the investigators reveal, the billionaires’ green network transfers millions of dollars from individual, corporate, and “charitable foundation” donors … through tax-exempt “educational” nonprofits that do not have to disclose donor names … to activist and pressure groups that work to influence elections, legislation, regulations, legal actions and public perceptions on energy and environmental issues. A lot of money originates with Russian and other foreign interests that want to protect their monopoly revenues.</P><P>Many wealthy donors and foundations that bankroll these operations also have venture capital firms that invest in “green” energy companies which benefit from the laws, policies, regulations and lawsuits – and from government contracts, grants, guaranteed loans, subsidies, feed-in tariffs, and mandates for energy systems, ethanol blends or wind and solar electricity. In turn, U.S. money can end up in the coffers of radical <A href=""http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/foreign-funding-for-adani-lawsuits/news-story/d7179b0bbdfa5967d7ffd292c75b3f6e"">Australian groups</A> that block coal exports to India, thereby keeping its people mired in poverty.</P><P>Coal billionaire/<mark>climate</mark> activist <STRONG><A href=""http://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2016/10/tom-steyer-pursuing-racial-and-economic-justice-issues-invested-heavily-in-for-profit-prisons-106634"">Tom Steyer</A></STRONG> and other club members invest in for-profit prisons where <A href=""http://freebeacon.com/issues/prison-labor-helps-solar-firm-backed-by-dem-donor-undercut-competition/"">inmates make</A> ultra-low-cost solar panels. <STRONG><A href=""http://www.investors.com/politics/viewpoint/russians-paying-to-kill-us-sandpiper-pipeline/"">Warren Buffett</A></STRONG> funneled millions through his family foundation to the secretive Tides Foundation to pressure groups campaigning against the Keystone and Sandpiper Pipelines, thereby benefiting his railroad and tank car companies that haul oil. Others support North Dakota pipeline protesters who <A href=""http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/25/obama-steers-clear-as-dakota-access-pipeline-prote/"">destroyed equipment</A>, mutilated cattle and harassed local residents.</P><P>One of the most clandestine, devious arrangements involves firms owned or controlled by Nathaniel Simons and Laura Baxter-Simons. Tax records reveal that their Sea Change Foundation gives tens of millions a year to the Natural Resources Defense Council, Food and Water Watch, U.S. <A href=""https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/the-<mark>climate</mark>-action-network-funding-<mark>climate</mark>-alarmist-stunts-around-the-world""><mark>Climate</mark> Action Network</A>, League of Conservation Voters, Center for American Progress, White House counselor <STRONG>John Podesta</STRONG>’s Progressive Policy Institute – and the Sierra Club, which received millions from Sea Change for its “Beyond Natural Gas” campaign, to battle drilling, fracking, pipelines, and hydro<mark>carbon</mark> use.</P><P>The Simons regularly give millions to Sea Change. Other donors include the Gates Foundation, eBay’s Omidyar Network Fund, <STRONG>David Rockefeller</STRONG>’s personal foundation, and the Walmart Foundation. Sea Change also gets money from hedge funds incorporated in Bermuda and headed by Simons’ father <STRONG>Jim Simons</STRONG>, a major Democratic donor whose net worth is over $12 billion.</P><P>But much of Sea Change’s funding comes through Bermuda-based Klein, Ltd., whose sole purpose is to channel money covertly to Sea Change and thence to environmental advocacy and “educational” groups. Klein is a shell company that exists only on paper. Its only officers are employees of Bermuda law firm Wakefield Quin, its address is the same as WQ’s, and its registered business agents work for Wakefield.</P><P>A sizable portion of Klein’s funds come from the IPOC Group, an international growth fund owned by Russian minister of telecommunications and Putin friend <STRONG>Leonid Reiman</STRONG>; Spectrum Partners, a Moscow-based energy investment firm with major assets in Russian oil and gas; <mark>Rosneft</mark>, the Russian-government-owned oil and gas giant that is one of Wakefield’s largest clients; and other Russian companies.</P><P>Their motives are easy to discern. U.S. fracking has battered Russia’s income, economy, and ruble. One way to reverse this is to support groups that oppose drilling, fracking, and pipelines – and support wind, solar, and biofuel projects that Simons views as the foundation of a future “low-<mark>carbon</mark> U.S. economy.”</P><P>That’s why <A href=""http://townhall.com/columnists/maritanoon/2016/10/17/wikileaks-hillarys-conflicted-comments-on-fracking-n2233435""><STRONG>Hillary Clinton</STRONG> told German bankers</A> in 2013 that U.S. energy development is “up against” Russian “oligarchs” who are funding “phony environmental groups.” She supports fracking, she claimed, while publicly saying her regulations won’t leave many places where the practice will be tolerated.</P><P>Nat Simons also runs venture capital firms Elan Management and its offshoot Prelude Ventures, which invest in “green energy” companies that benefit from policies that his Sea Change operations promote. At least seven companies in Prelude’s portfolio (including prison-labor solar company Suniva) have received bounteous federal funding from the Energy, Defense, Agriculture and Justice Departments, the National Science Foundation, and other agencies.

At the moment, there are large amounts of traffic on urban streets that create an increase in air <mark>pollution</mark> and loud noise. From our conversations with city officials, we’ve learned that future mobility services can only be successful if they can efficiently connect public transport and individual mobility.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">We presented our conception of future mobility during <mark>BMW</mark>’s 100 year anniversary with the <mark>BMW</mark> VISION NEXT concept cars. The car of the future is autonomous, connected, electric, <mark>sustainable</mark>, and, if desired, shareable between multiple clients. We see trends toward these developments in “Automated,”“Connected, “Electrified,” and “Shared”– ACES for short.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">In coming years, we will witness the automobile change more rapidly and substantially than ever before. Our customers should look forward to new technology and customization options. The future is exciting!</P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><STRONG>How is <mark>BMW</mark> helping to develop smart and liveable cities?</STRONG></P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">We have the opportunity to make cities more livable through technology. Our innovative vehicles and services are the primary method to achieve this.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Additionally, the <mark>BMW</mark> Group has founded a research center for urban mobility, with comprised of a variety of experts from different fields. The joint task of the team is to engage with leaders of big cities and analyze their needs. This is at the prerequisite for developing new urban mobility solutions together with cities.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><STRONG>What do you see as the barriers to achieving large scale <mark>sustainable</mark> urban mobility?</STRONG></P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">There are currently big differences in how electro-mobility is being promoted in different countries and cities. Positive examples, like Norway, show what can be achieved with a proactive effort – one in three new cars is electric. Unfortunately, there is a lack of adequate electric vehicle charging infrastructure in many cities worldwide. This can scare away potential customers, who would otherwise want to make the switch to environmentally-friendly electro-mobility.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><STRONG>What are the key <mark>innovation</mark>s and solutions that <mark>BMW</mark> are bringing to the <mark>climate change</mark> effort?</STRONG></P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">In our view, it is crucial to adopt a comprehensive approach to combatting <mark>climate change</mark> as business. Within the framework of our ten sustainability goals, we have targets for our products, services, production, and supply chain. In this way, we want to significantly reduce the <mark>CO2</mark> emissions of our vehicles, be a leading provider of electro-mobility, and permanently change mobility behaviour in cities.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">At the same time, we are continuing to pursue our goal of further reducing <mark>CO2</mark> emissions at our production facilities. We are increasing the energy efficiency of our facilities and are investing in renewable energy. Our vision is to ultimately have a completely emissions-free production process. To achieve this, we increased the share of renewable energy in our purchased energy mix to 63%. We built wind turbines at our Leipzig plant, where we build our <mark>BMW</mark> i vehicles. Our Oxford plant is relying on solar energy, while our Rosslyn, South Africa plant uses biogas. In the US we use energy sources such as hydropower as well as methane gas. There are countless examples of how we are achieving our energy goal step by step.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><STRONG>How does your involvement with Formula E support your <mark>BMW</mark>i/urban mobility offering?</STRONG></P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">While de<mark>carbon</mark>ization is the key theme of our industry, the <mark>BMW</mark> Group has a strong athletic identity in its brand and production. Our dynamic identity has always made our products stand out. Given the air quality needs of large cities, Formel E offers an interesting approach to combining racing and <mark>sustainable</mark> mobility.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><STRONG>Why does <mark>BMW</mark> continue to be involved with the <mark>Sustainable</mark> <mark>Innovation</mark> Forum?</STRONG></P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">The <mark>BMW</mark> Group’s commitment to the <mark>Sustainable</mark> <mark>Innovation</mark> Forum is a unique tradition, and for good reason. <mark>Sustainable</mark> management is part of our corporate strategy. We have a holistic approach to sustainability across our entire value chain. At the same time, we are aware for that many goals can only be achieved in cooperation with partners and stakeholders. That’s why we are taking part in an exchange of ideas and information with other stakeholders as part of this global dialogue. The forum is the perfect venue for this. </P><P style=""text-align: justify;""> </P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><STRONG>About the <mark>Sustainable</mark> <mark>Innovation</mark> Forum </STRONG></P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">The largest business-focused event held during the annual Conference of Parties (COP), the <mark>Sustainable</mark> <mark>Innovation</mark> Forum 2017 heads to Bonn, Germany – the home of the UNFCCC. </P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Now in its 8th year, the event will gather 600+ of the most influential national and local policy makers, UN agencies, business leaders, investors and international NGOs to meet, share knowledge and lead by example towards the full achievement of the Paris Agreement's ambitious <mark>climate</mark> goals.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><STRONG>Ursula Mathar, VP <mark>BMW</mark> Group</STRONG></P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">Ursula Mathar is the <mark>BMW</mark> Group Vice President of „Sustainability &amp; Environmental Protection“.

They sell very big, heavy, polluting cars.”</P><P>Proposed regulations would see new European cars required to emit no more on average than 95grammes of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide per kilometre by 2020, an improvement on the current target of 120g<mark>CO2</mark>/km by 2015.</P><P><STRONG>Political power</STRONG></P><P>This policy was expected to have been agreed by EU leaders at the end of June 2013, but German Chancellor Merkel <A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/28/angela-merkel-eu-car-emissions"">cut a deal</A> with British Prime Minister David Cameron to block its progress.</P><P>Merkel’s logic is fairly simple. With elections scheduled for September, she did not want to be seen harming the German car industry. And <mark>BMW</mark>’s hierarchy let her know this is how any EU deal would be portrayed.</P><P>One Brussels insider, who declined to be named due to ongoing EU negotiations told RTCC: “<mark>BMW</mark>’s influence with the [German] government is very strong – it’s incredible”.</P><P>Jurgen Pieper, a European automotive expert at the Frankfurt-based Metzler Bank, sees the i3 as part of a wider push by <mark>BMW</mark> CEO Norbert Reithofer to shift to “greener cars”, but says it’s not a sign of a wider change in direction.</P><P>“As <mark>BMW</mark> still earns a lot of money with its traditional gasoline and diesel cars, it is lobbying at the same time for higher <mark>CO2</mark> targets,” he told RTCC.</P><P><STRONG>Super-credits</STRONG></P><P>Analysts believe the EU will rubberstamp an emissions limit after the German elections, but there is still considerable concern that <mark>BMW</mark>, Daimler and Audi will try and weaken the proposals.</P><P>One way is through the allocation of ‘super-credits’. This is a way of rewarding companies who invest in low <mark>carbon</mark> cars with offsets on their more polluting models.</P><P>In its most basic form, if a company produces one electric car (EV) it can ‘offset’ the emissions from a petrol or diesel vehicle.</P><P>But a ‘multiplier’ formula pushed by <mark>BMW</mark> and its allies means one EV could account for two or even three conventional cars, a plan Cecile Toubeau says would undermine the whole concept of setting emission limits.</P><P>“On the one hand you have <mark>BMW</mark> who came out saying how green they are, and on the other you have them devising the super-credits scheme that means they fundamentally don’t have to change anything they are doing,” she said.</P><P>“They can bring out a car, market it and help improve their brand, but the reality is they don’t have to shift high numbers to be able to continue selling the gas guzzlers they sell.”</P><P>Our Brussels insider agrees with this analysis, but points out that other car makers like Ford and VW are happy with the EU proposals, because their products are already at the lower end of the <mark>pollution</mark> scale.</P><P>“<mark>BMW</mark> and Daimler have been strongly trying to water the regulations down, and introduce flexibility instruments like super-credits,” they said.</P><P>“If you look at it from their point of view it makes sense, because <mark>BMW</mark> and Daimler have a very different fleet compared to other manufacturers.”</P><P>The evidence suggests that in the words of its advertisement, <mark>BMW</mark> does fear change, and is willing to go to extreme lengths to ensure it happens as slowly as possible.</P><P><STRONG>Mobility solutions</STRONG></P><P>On this basis it’s easy to dismiss <mark>BMW</mark>’s new electric cars as an expensive form of ‘greenwash’, but other analysts say this would be unfair, and inaccurate.</P><P>One of the more interesting components of the i3 is the range of mobility solutions its purchase offers to drivers, who are not just getting a car, but access to other vehicles and software to make their travels easier.</P><P>Peugeot and Daimler have similar schemes, but Peter Fuss, E&amp;Y’s Automotive Leader in Germany, says the i3 is a sign that <mark>BMW</mark> is planning for 20-30 years time, when a car will be important but only as part of a package of services.</P><P>“The customer is changing, and requiring more of this. They no longer want to own a car – they want to move from A-B in the most cost efficient way,” he told RTCC. “That means car sharing and integrated mobility, smart mobility. <mark>BMW</mark> calls it 360 degrees mobility.</P><P>“When we look back in 20 years the launch of the i3 may be a revolution, because it is changing the whole concept of the industry.”</P><P>Fuss believes the launch of a larger i8 model in 2015 will take <mark>BMW</mark> another step down the road of this ‘evolution’, which he suggests could see leading manufacturers and megacities working in harmony to develop emission free infrastructure.</P><P><mark>BMW</mark>’s reluctance to ditch its range of high emission ‘premium’ vehicles suggests it is far from ‘going green’, and still wedded to the conventional business model of car ownership, but as cities absorb more people this may – as Fuss indicates – become un<mark>sustainable</mark>.</P><P>“When you see people living in London, New York and Amsterdam attracting business, part of this is who provides the best living environment and mobility,” he said.</P><P>“When you combine this it is not just selling cars any longer. There is much more required. Who owns the mobility of the future? Car manufacturers, google, apple or leasing companies?”</P><P>Perhaps in this aspect alone, <mark>BMW</mark>, which boasts of manufacturing the ‘ultimate driving machine’, may be slightly ahead of the curve.</P><DIV class=""yarpp-related""><H3>Related posts:</H3></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></BODY></HTML>",2.0,2.0,Positive

Scientists had already been warning that a runaway greenhouse effect could disrupt Earth’s <mark>climate</mark> system to a point of no return. <mark>Climate change</mark> impacts continued to worsen in regions across the globe, and few communities were sufficiently prepared for these impacts. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil was investing its massive $45 billion in earnings in maximizing extraction and processing of oil and gas, including the controversial use of hydrofracturing (fracking) to extract fuel from tar sands and the expansion of offshore oil drilling. Despite pressure from shareholders to address <mark>climate change</mark> meaningfully, CEO Rex Tillerson stood his ground in suggesting that bringing fossil fuels to those who lack ready access (such as the <A href=""https://www.iea.org/topics/energypoverty/"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>1.2 billion people without electricity</STRONG></A>) was the “humanitarian” thing to do, rather than leading the transition away from an increasingly risky high-<mark>carbon</mark> energy future. By 2013, nine of the ten hottest years on record had occurred since the turn of the century, and growing instances of harmful <mark>climate</mark> impacts across the US and the world were impossible to ignore. Yet, these risks were readily discounted by corporate leadership at ExxonMobil.<STRONG>The Rising Stakes of Escalating Greenhouse Gas Emissions in 2013</STRONG>In the spring of 2013, the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii reported that the concentration of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere had exceeded 400 parts per million for the first time in human history; indeed, for the first time in millions of years. The last time levels were this high, Earth was in the middle of the Miocene period and there was almost no ice on the planet. A <A href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2013/05/130510-earth-<mark>co2</mark>-milestone-400-ppm"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>feature article</STRONG></A> in <EM>National Geographic</EM> puts things in perspective:</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px;"">“The last time the concentration of Earth’s main greenhouse gas reached this mark, horses and camels lived in the high Arctic. Seas were at least 30 feet higher—at a level that today would inundate major cities around the world. The planet was about 2 to 3 degrees Celsius (3.6 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer. But the Earth then was in the final stage of a prolonged greenhouse epoch, and CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations were on their way down.”</P><P>According to <A href=""https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/201313"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center</STRONG></A>, “2013 tied with 2003 as the fourth warmest year globally since records began in 1880.” The year 2013 also marked “the 37<SUP>th</SUP> consecutive year (since 1976) that the annual temperature was above the long-term average.” As of 2013, nine of the ten warmest years on record had occurred during the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century; only one year, 1998, was warmer than 2013. Global average temperatures were climbing steadily, at rate of about a third of a degree Fahrenheit since 1970. The previous year, 2012, was the hottest year on record in the lower 48 states. <EM>It is virtually impossible to believe that this corporation, with all of its scientific prowess, did not know this.</EM></P><P>In January 2013, the US Global Change Research Program released a draft of the third National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment, a comprehensive report of <mark>climate</mark> impacts being experienced in the United States — an assessment required by law to be conducted and published at least once every four years. As <A href=""http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/national-<mark>climate</mark>-assessment-obama-best-chance-global-warming"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>reported</STRONG></A> by Chris Mooney at <EM>Mother Jones</EM> at the time (now a journalist at the <EM>Washington Post</EM>), the draft report warned unequivocally that unchecked greenhouse gas emissions would cause the global warming trend to “accelerate significantly,” bringing more heat waves and weather extremes, severe storms, rising seas, devastating floods, prolonged droughts, and more. The key takeaway quote was made by Ed Maibach, director of George Mason University’s Center for <mark>Climate Change</mark> Communication and a member of the federal advisory committee that released the assessment: “Data is accumulating to show that Americans want their politicians to take action.” Still, despite <A href=""https://www.c2es.org/federal/congress/113"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>a host of <mark>climate change</mark> bills</STRONG></A> introduced in both the House and the Senate in the 113<SUP>th</SUP> Congress, the passage of meaningful <mark>climate</mark> legislation was not yet in the cards, and is even less of a possibility today given the current political <mark>climate</mark>.</P><P><STRONG>The Underwhelming Response by Rex Tillerson and the Exxon Mobil Corporation</STRONG>Meanwhile, the ExxonMobil Corporation had taken in a whopping $45 billion in earnings in 2012. It expanded extraction using hydrofracturing in tar sands to increase activity in offshore oil drilling all over the world, thereby maximizing its rate of fossil fuel extraction and processing. <A href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exxonmobil-corporation-ceo-hosts-annual-221305776.html"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>Addressing shareholders</STRONG></A> at the company’s annual meeting on May 29, 2013, CEO Rex Tillerson bragged that 2012 earnings were the second highest in the history of the oil giant, and was crystal clear about corporate priorities:</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px;"">“In 2012 we invested $39.8 billion in capital expenditures and total shareholder distributions were $30.1 billion. For the 19th consecutive year, we added more oil and natural gas reserves than we produced and our crude reserve replacement rate exceeded 100%. All of the above results reflect the hard work, diligence and dedication of the almost 77,000 men and women who work on ExxonMobil’s behalf the world over.”</P><P>Tillerson was aware of pressure from shareholders to address the <mark>climate</mark> threat more meaningfully than it had been doing. Pressure was even coming from heirs to the oil fortune, descendants of the company’s original founders. Jane Dale Owen, granddaughter of one of the founders of Humble Oil, the parent company of ExxonMobil, <A href=""https://thinkprogress.org/how-will-exxonmobil-adapt-to-<mark>climate</mark>-change-crisis-it-helped-create-4b5047d16b8c"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>made a strong appeal</STRONG></A> to shareholders to put more pressure on corporate leadership to divert its resources to cleaner more renewable forms of energy. She wrote:</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px;"">“As I cast my votes this year, I hope that more shareholders will get involved to move ExxonMobil toward a life-sustaining future. ExxonMobil’s $44.9 billion in earnings for 2012 came close to a world’s record. Instead of wildcatting in costly, unproven non-conventional fossil fuel technologies such as fracking and tar sands that add greenhouse gas to the atmosphere, the company could show foresight and leadership by investing in clean, renewable energy such as wind, solar and geothermal.”</P><P>But the shareholder resolution asking the company to set greenhouse gas and emissions reductions goals was defeated: even though it got a respectable share of the vote – 26.8% of voting shares supported the resolution – 73.2% voted against. Still, this sent a strong message to corporate leadership. Normally, when more than a quarter of shareholders demand an outcome, most corporate leaders make strong efforts to meet that outcome; Rex Tillerson was not among them. Instead, despite the growing certainty of <mark>climate</mark> science that was readily available and widely communicated to the public – most recently in the draft Fourth National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment – <A href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/exxonmobil-corporation-ceo-hosts-annual-221305776.html"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>he had this to say</STRONG></A>:</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px;"">“If you examine the temperature record of the last decade, it really hadn’t changed. I know you will like to hear that as it don’t [sic] comport to some of the views of others, but last 10 years’ temperatures had been relatively flat.”</P><P>This statement is false and misleading, and is a classic example of one of the favorite tactics of <mark>climate change</mark> deniers: the use of short time periods to draw false conclusions about longer-term trends. As stated above, nine of the hottest ten years on record had occurred since 2000, and one of those ten occurred in 1998.</P><P>Moreover, instead of acknowledging the urgency of the problem and the growing certainty of the science, Tillerson brought out the tired claim that the science justifying action was not there yet: “[O]ur ability to understand all of the relationships between emissions and the environment and the feedback loops continues to be one of the science community’s grand challenges,” he said. Exaggerating scientific uncertainty around the <mark>climate change</mark> threat was one of the planned tactics of the oil industry’s Global <mark>Climate</mark> Coalition formed in the 1980s to push back against the Kyoto Protocol, and continued to be a recurrent theme at Exxon headquarters.</P><P>At the shareholders meeting, Tillerson pointed out that fossil energy raises the standard of living for people and asked, “What good is it to save the planet if humanity suffers in the process?” The irony of his statement was lost on him: those who were already suffering – and dying – ­from <mark>climate</mark> impacts (such as more extreme weather, intense flooding, prolonged droughts, and so on) evidently were not considered in Tillerson’s equation.</P><P>In a <A href=""http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en/company/news-and-updates/speeches/a-business-perspective-on-global-energy-markets"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>speech</STRONG></A> delivered just days later, in June 2013, to the Asia Society, Tillerson reiterated the corporate “feel good” philosophy – the story company leaders apparently told themselves to justify the drill-baby-drill mentality:</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px;"">“Approximately 1.3 billion people on our planet still do not have access to electricity for basic needs like clean water, cooking, sanitation, light, or for the safe storage of food and medicine. Therefore, whether we are leaders in business, policymakers in government, or decision makers in philanthropic organizations, the need to expand energy supplies has a humanitarian dimension that should inform and should guide our energy policy dialogue.”</P><P>So, following this logic, it’s humanitarian to continue, even to expand, our dangerous addiction to fossil fuels worldwide. But is it humanitarian to bury one’s head in the sand when it comes to the negative side effects of continuing this reliance?</P><P>Contrast Exxon’s and Tillerson’s message, which implies that it’s the right thing to do to lock us into a high-<mark>carbon</mark> energy future, with that made by the newly reelected President Barack Obama in his January 2013 Inaugural Address. President Obama <A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>sciencewatch.org/2013/01/22/looking-ahead-from-the-inaugural-address/""><STRONG>declared</STRONG></A>:</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px;"">“We will respond to the threat of <mark>climate change</mark>, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations. Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling drought, and more powerful storms. The path towards <mark>sustainable</mark> energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult. But America cannot resist this transition; we must lead it.”</P><P>Evidently ExxonMobil had no intention of leading this transition; rather, the corporate attitude was spelled out clearly in its <A href=""https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/34088/000003408814000012/xom10k2013.htm"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>2013 10-K report </STRONG></A>to the SEC and shareholders. Public policies that protect against environmental harms are listed as a business risk,<EM> i.e. </EM>a threat to their basic business model. Under the category “Regulatory and litigation risks” the 10-K says specifically that “changes in environmental regulations or other laws that increase our cost of compliance or reduce or delay available business opportunities (including changes in laws related to offshore drilling operations, water use, or hydraulic fracturing)” are a risk to the company’s health and wellbeing. Also listed under “risks” to the bottom line are policies or regulations that promote “alternative fuels” or “uncompetitive fuel components” – as these further “expose” the company and “could adversely affect results.”</P><P>It is apparent to us that Tillerson was seeing <mark>climate change</mark> in a different light: the global warming trend was having the effect of making it possible to drill for oil in areas that had heretofore been too covered in thick ice to make drilling feasible. In February, ExxonMobil and <mark>Rosneft</mark> (Russia’s state-run oil company) agreed to <A href=""http://news.exxonmobil.com/press-release/<mark>rosneft</mark>-and-exxonmobil-expand-strategic-cooperation"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>expand the deal</STRONG></A> they made in 2011 to drill for oil in the Russian Arctic. The 10-K report mentions the new joint venture with <mark>Rosneft</mark> and talks about this massive Russia oil deal this way:</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px;"">“ExxonMobil’s net acreage holdings in Sakhalin at year-end 2013 were 85 thousand acres, all offshore. A total of 0.9 net development wells were completed. Development activities continued on the Arkutun-Dagi project during 2013. At year-end 2013, ExxonMobil’s net acreage in the <mark>Rosneft</mark> joint venture agreements for the Kara and Black Seas was 11.3 million acres, all offshore.”</P><P>This Russia oil deal has raised much controversy, has now made ExxonMobil subject to penalties and fines for violating US sanctions against the country, and is a focal point of concerns surrounding the appointment of Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State. This will be covered extensively in future posts.</P><P><STRONG>How was ExxonMobil Talking about Addressing the Global Threat of <mark>Climate Change</mark>?</STRONG>The <A href=""https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/34088/000003408814000012/xom10k2013.htm"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>2013 10-K report</STRONG></A> address <mark>climate change</mark> and <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions this way:</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px;""><STRONG>“<mark>Climate change</mark> and greenhouse gas restrictions.</STRONG> Due to concern over the risk of <mark>climate change</mark>, a number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These include adoption of cap and trade regimes, <mark>carbon</mark> taxes, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. These requirements could make our products more expensive, lengthen project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s, as well as shift hydro<mark>carbon</mark> demand toward relatively lower-<mark>carbon</mark> sources such as natural gas. Current and pending greenhouse gas regulations may also increase our compliance costs, such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions.”</P><P>It is a well-known fact that cadres of highly paid lobbyists representing ExxonMobil and the American Petroleum Institute fought hard against the so-called Waxman-Markey bill, a comprehensive legislative proposal before the Congress in 2009 that passed the House but was not brought up in the Senate. The American Clean Energy and Security Act, if passed, would have established a broad cap-and-trade scheme and required cuts in <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions across the board. Oil, gas, and coal companies were vehemently opposed to this, and used vast resources to defeat the proposal — the only major <mark>climate</mark> bill to have real legs.</P><P>ExxonMobil’s formal position supporting a <mark>carbon</mark> tax grew out of its opposition to a cap-and-trade scheme. While many have praised the oil giant for adopting a more enlightened policy position, it is probably more accurate to say that the company’s leadership is hedging its bets and using its support for a <mark>carbon</mark> tax to help fend off stricter public policy solutions. It is also quite likely that corporate accountants have found a way to make this a win-win, monetarily, for ExxonMobil. Consider <A href=""https://www.thestreet.com/story/12728015/1/why-a-<mark>carbon</mark>-tax-could-profit-us-business-consumers.html"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>this statement</STRONG></A> regarding the company’s stated concern about regressive taxation:</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px;"">“If policymakers do move to impose a cost on <mark>carbon</mark>, we believe that a <mark>carbon</mark> tax would be a more effective policy option to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions than alternatives such as cap-and-trade. And to ensure revenues raised from such a tax are indeed directed to investment, and to assist those on lower incomes who spend a higher proportion of their income on energy, a <mark>carbon</mark> tax should be offset by tax reductions in other areas to become revenue neutral for government. It is rare that a business lends its support to new taxes. But in this case, given the risk-management challenges we face and the policy alternatives under consideration, it is our judgment that a <mark>carbon</mark> tax is a preferred course of public policy action versus cap and trade approaches.”</P><P>In other words, ExxonMobil is looking for a zero-sum game in which a <mark>carbon</mark> tax would be offset by tax benefits, and the cost to the company would essentially be nil.</P><P><STRONG>How was ExxonMobil Talking about Low-<mark>Carbon</mark> Renewable Energy Options</STRONG>The company’s <A href=""https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/34088/000003408814000012/xom10k2013.htm"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>2013 10-K report</STRONG></A> says this about renewable energy, referring to it as “alternative energy” that has more negative connotations in the energy business world than does the word “renewable”:</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px;""><STRONG>“Government sponsorship of alternative energy.</STRONG> Many governments are providing tax advantages and other subsidies to support alternative energy sources or are mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies. Governments are also promoting research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources. We are conducting our own research efforts into alternative energy, such as through sponsorship of the Global <mark>Climate</mark> and Energy Project at Stanford University and research into liquid products from algae and biomass that can be further converted to transportation fuels. Our future results may depend in part on the success of our research efforts and on our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the energy products of the future in a cost-competitive manner.”</P><P>ExxonMobil’s attempted venture into the use of algal biofuels would allow the company — if successful — to continue to use much of its existing infrastructure. But in March 2013, the company announced it was <A href=""http://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Biofuels/Exxons-100m-Algae-Investment-Falls-Flat.html"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>pulling out</STRONG></A> of a $600 million project to make motor fuels from algae, a joint venture with Synthetic Genomics Inc., less than six years after the project <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/07/14/14greenwire-exxon-sinks-600m-into-algae-based-biofuels-in-33562.html"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>began in July 2007</STRONG></A>.

The vast amount of data Heede meticulously excavated and organized revealed a stark reality about <A href=""http://<mark>carbon</mark>majors.org/"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG><mark>carbon</mark> majors</STRONG></A> that surprised many: a mere 90 companies were responsible for two-thirds of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.

In 2013, the Union of Concerned Scientists <A href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/solutions/fight-misinformation/global-warming-skeptic.html#.WOHBA1KZORs"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>published a document</STRONG></A> listing these groups which it refers to as “skeptic” organizations; a term CSPW takes issue with, as healthy skepticism is a lynchpin in the scientific process — without it, peer review would be a fruitless exercise. The UCS web page, “Global Warming Skeptic Organizations,” lists all the groups that take oil industry money to spread propaganda about the <mark>climate change</mark> threat and the underpinning science. The American Enterprise Institute, Americans for Prosperity, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Heartland Institute, the Heritage Foundation, and a few others are profiled. The “global warming denial machine” was alive and well in 2013, and continued to have an impact on public opinion regarding the seriousness of the problem.</P><P>Moreover, some truly ridiculous statements were being made about <mark>climate change</mark> by people who had a voice in American discourse and a responsibility not to say such things. The June 2013 issue of <EM>Rolling Stone </EM>published some of these utterings, several made by prominent elected officials, in its funny article, “<A href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-10-dumbest-things-ever-said-about-global-warming-20130619"" class=""external external_icon"" target=""_blank""><STRONG>The 10 Dumbest Things Ever Said About Global Warming</STRONG></A>,” just as likely to draw tears as it is to invoke laughter. Yet, this was part and parcel to the groupthink at the time, and in many ways, still is: sad, but true.</P><P><STRONG>High Marks to the Obama Administration for Taking on <mark>Climate Change</mark> Impact Preparedness</STRONG>In 2008, <mark>Climate</mark> Science Watch called for the US federal government to take on a National <mark>Climate Change</mark> Preparedness Initiative. On November 1, 2013, President Obama signed an Executive Order doing just that. As CSW founder Rick Piltz <A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>sciencewatch.org/2013/11/04/obama-preparedness-executive-order-part1/""><STRONG>noted at the time</STRONG></A>, the order, “Preparing the United States for the Impacts of <mark>Climate Change</mark>,” was long overdue. Piltz stated:</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px;"">“It has taken 25 years – since the global warming problem was first recognized as a major public issue — to get to this stage, with <mark>climate change</mark> preparedness planning and action being framed as a U.S. presidential order to the Executive Branch.”</P><P>One can only imagine the extent of lives saved, habitat spared from destruction, property damage avoided, if such an initiative had taken hold decades earlier. The failure to prepare adequately for <mark>climate</mark> conditions has imposed a heavy cost, one that only goes up over time.</P><P>While this Preparedness Initiative only went so far, and never truly took a strong hold on local, state, or federal public policymaking, it is an idea that should be supported and expanded, not abandoned as the Trump Administration has clearly done.</P><P>In sum, the Exxon Mobil Corporation has not been taking the <mark>climate change</mark> threat seriously enough to do justice to its investors and shareholders. Old-school mentality dominates the corporate culture, and has been articulated clearly year after year in its 10-K reports to shareholders.

Another contributing factor, state officials believe, is that consumers appear to be buying bigger, more powerful and more gas-guzzling vehicles like SUVs and trucks.</P><P>Approximately 62 percent of all vehicles sold in the U.S. during the first quarter of this year were SUVs and pickup trucks, a 5 percent increase from motor vehicle sales for the same period in 2016, the <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/business/suv-automakers-fuel-economy-new-york.html"">New York Times reported.</A></P><P>Richard McAllister, general sales manager for <A href=""http://www.hartfordtoyota.com/"">Hartford Toyota</A>, said the national trend toward bigger vehicles that use more gas is definitely reflected in Connecticut sales. &quot;We used to be more of a passenger car dealership,&quot; McAllister said, selling fuel-efficient cars like Camrys for the urban market.</P><P>&quot;We used to do two-to-one Camry sales to Rav4s [Toyota's crossover SUV model],&quot; McAllister said. &quot;Now it's almost two-to-one sales of Rav4s to Camrys.

The water is used to power turbines or for cooling and is almost always returned to the source immediately. Agriculture is the largest &quot;consumer&quot; of water because it pulls water from the source and locks it up in products, not returning it to the source immediately, if ever.</P><P> </P><P>[xvi]  $414 billion of externalized costs breaks down to: $314 billion in health-care costs, $38 billion in subsides, $37 billion in environmental costs, $21 billion in cruelty costs, $4 billion in fishing-related costs.

Additionally, using any agricultural database regionally, nationally, or internationally, one can calculate that on average between 10 times and 100 times (in weight) more plant foods (vegetables, fruit, grain/nuts) on one acre of land than from animal products raised on that same acre of land, regardless of the level of fertility of that particular acre of land, presuming it is the same acre used for either product, animal or plant based.</P><P> </P><P>[xviii] Many organizations are studying humanity’s effect on soil degradation, erosion, and eventual desertification but not willing to emphasize the final connection of dots to animal agriculture. According to the UNCCD (United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification), nearly 20 million acres of arable land is lost each year due to desertification and the primary reasons are:</P><P>1. deforestation due to cultivation of crops and pasture</P><P>2. overgrazing from livestock (“eating away grasses and eroding topsoil with hooves”)</P><P>3. intensive farming stripping away nutrients in soil</P><P><A href=""http://www.un.org/en/events/desertificationday/background.shtml"">http://www.un.org/en/events/desertificationday/background.shtml</A></P><P>Overgrazing by livestock is the principal land problem related to desertification as indicated in the article: <A href=""http://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/docs/002-186/002-186.html"">http://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/docs/002-186/002-186.html</A> And, according to the UNDDD: “Nearly 20% of the degrading land (globally) is cropland, and 20-25%, rangeland.” Understanding that over 70% of the global arable land used for agriculture is planted for crops grown for livestock, there is be ample support for the statement that “animal agriculture is the leading driver for approximately 1/3 of the land lost on earth due to desertification.” <A href=""http://www.un.org/en/events/desertification_decade/whynow.shtml"">http://www.un.org/en/events/desertification_decade/whynow.shtml</A></P><P> </P><P>[xix]   Few prominent scientists will openly proclaim the connection of their research findings with the need to eliminate animal agriculture or promotion of fully plant based nutrition. This is an observation that spans all aspects of global depletion related to food choice, including the topic of loss of biodiversity and extinction of species. </P><P>The statement that animal agriculture is the primary driver of biodiversity loss and extinction of species is supported by many discussions and interviews with leading authors and scientists working for the Convention of Biodiversity and IUCN as well as publications regarding current biodiversity assessments as presented by Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, the IUCN Red List, and the Global Environmental and Biodiversity Outlook.</P><P>Most organizations that associate their work with species and ecosystem/biodiversity concerns as well as the scientific community as a whole believe that the six main threats to our oceans are <mark>climate change</mark>, overfishing, predator loss, <mark>pollution</mark>, destruction of habitat, and bycatch, (“bykill”).</P><P>(For instance: The Species Survival Commission of the World Conservation Union and the Convention on Biological Diversity).</P><P>As of August 2012, the 2004 Global Species Assessment was the most recent empirical data on global extinction rates, based on birds, mammals, and amphibians. According to an interview conducted by Dr. Oppenlander with Simon Stuart, PhD, chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Species Survival Commission:</P><P>“Habitat loss from grazing livestock and feed crops is far and away the most pervasive threat to terrestrial animal species, impacting 86 percent of all mammals, 88 percent of amphibians, and 86 percent of all birds. One in every eight birds, one in every three amphibians, and one in every four mammals is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the near future. Overexploitation of wild animals for consumption remains a second major factor for extinction, such as can be seen in bushmeat trade in Africa and Southeast Asia and all hunting endeavors on land, globally.” </P><P>The Alliance for Global Conservation estimates 36 percent of all species on our planet are in danger of extinction.</P><P>Scientists have divided our planet into 825 terrestrial “ecoregions” (as well as 450 freshwater and a number of oceanic ecoregions), each defined by its own distinct set of animal and plant species, as well as <mark>climate</mark>. Of all these land ecoregions, almost half are reported by lead scientists (interviews/discussions) to have livestock as a current threat. The World Conservation Union reported in 2010 that “most of the world’s endangered or threatened species” on their Red List (which lists the species that are most endangered) are suffering habitat loss due to livestock—not due to agriculture but to livestock.</P><P>The Convention on Biological Diversity, held in Nagoya, Japan, in October 2010 agreed that none of their goals from 2002 for lessening the rate of biodiversity loss were met. The attendees confirmed that the main pressures for the rapid loss of species—habitat change, overexploitation, <mark>pollution</mark>, invasive species, and <mark>climate change</mark>—were all increasing in intensity.</P><P>Current biodiversity assessments (as presented by Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, the IUCN Red List, and the Global Environmental and Biodiversity Outlook) now generally agree that land use change, modification of river flow, freshwater <mark>pollution</mark>, and exploitation of marine environments are the most significant drivers of biodiversity change and loss of species. Because more than 50% of the land use changes on Earth are related to livestock (ILRI), 70 to 90% of freshwater <mark>pollution</mark> in western countries (particularly the U.S. and China) can be traced back to animal agriculture, minimally 14.5% of anthropogenic GHG emissions/<mark>climate change</mark>, and 100% of “exploitation of marine environments” is related to the global commercial fishing industry, it can be safely and confidently demonstrated that “the primary driver of global species’ extinctions and loss of biodiversity is animal agriculture.” </P><P> </P><P>[xx] The amount of water, land and fuel used for differing diets varies greatly from the types of foods consumed, amount consumed and the geographical region where the food was raised. Taking into consideration that 1lb of beef requires upwards of 2500 gallons of water to produce compared to only 25 gallons for 1lb of wheat, the water footprint of a person consuming a high meat diet could be 100x greater than that of a person consuming only plant foods. The same applies for land and oil use. Many arid areas of the world can not support 1 cow per 2 acres and require 50+ acre per cow, compared to a crops such as potatoes that can produce 50,000lbs+ per acre. The energy/fuel inputs are similar. 1 calorie of beef can take 27x more energy to produce than soybeans. </P><P>xxi (New) As of 2016 the estimates of wild horses and burros has increased on the range to 67,027 and the amount of wild horses and burros in holding fcailities is more than 45,000. However the BLM considers the amount of wild horses and burros on the range too populated and will attempt to remove 40,000 to bring the level back to what is considered by the BLM the 'acceptable level'</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html"" data-block-type=""2"" id=""block-yui_3_17_2_15_1414543521348_68760""><DIV class=""sqs-block-content""><P style=""text-align:center""> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,0.0,

They are not intended to replace or supersede the applicable statutes and regulations. The <mark>BMW</mark> requirements are found in Section 22a-209-15 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies incorporating Sections 22a-209b &amp; c of the Connecticut General Statutes (CGS). It is your responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

The definition of <mark>BMW</mark> excludes hazardous and radioactive waste as defined in state law. Some examples of <mark>BMW</mark> include blood and other bodily fluids, sharps, discarded animal carcasses known to have been exposed to an infectious agent, etc. </P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">Who generates <mark>BMW</mark>?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">A &quot;generator&quot; of <mark>BMW</mark> is any person who owns or operates a facility that produces <mark>BMW</mark> in any quantity. This includes, but is not limited to, the following: hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, laboratories, physicians’ offices, veterinarians, dental offices, funeral homes, industry, etc. In the case where more than one generator of <mark>BMW</mark> is located in the same building, each individual business entity is considered a separate generator. Note: waste generated by an individual at home is specifically not regulated as <mark>BMW</mark>.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">Is <mark>BMW</mark> regulated as hazardous waste?</P></I></B><P align=""left""><mark>BMW</mark> is regulated as hazardous waste only if it contains a listed hazardous waste or exhibits a hazardous characteristic per the CT Hazardous Waste Management Regulations.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">What are &quot;sharps&quot;?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Sharps are discarded needles and lancets that have been used in animal or human patient care/ treatment or in medical, research, or industrial laboratories. Sharps include items such as hypodermic needles, syringes, dental carpels, and scalpel blades. Please note that certain exemptions apply to farmers. For a list of qualifying items see CGS section 22a-209b(13). </P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">How should individuals at home dispose <mark>BMW</mark>?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Sharps used at home are not regulated as <mark>BMW</mark>. However, throwing them in the household trash or flushing them down the toilet presents serious risks for both you and others who may come in contact with such items. Improper disposal of sharps can lead to:</P></LI><LI>Needle-stick injuries that cause infection and spread disease; 
</LI><LI>Injuries to curious children, waste haulers, recycling workers, and animals; or 
</LI><LI>Needles washing up on our beaches and riverbanks. </LI><P align=""left"">The DEEP recommends checking with your supplier (i.e. your physician, local hospital, or pharmacy) to see if they are willing to accept properly packaged used sharps. Some companies even offer mail-back disposal services to their customers.</P><P align=""left"">To properly dispose of sharps:</P><UL type=""disc""><LI>Seal them in rigid, puncture-resistant containers that you can’t see through (i.e. bleach or detergent bottles, coffee cans, etc.); 
</LI><LI>Label the containers &quot;Do Not Recycle;&quot; and 
</LI><LI>Reinforce containers with heavy-duty tape before throwing them in your household trash. </LI></UL><B><P align=""left"">DO NOT:</P></B><UL type=""disc""><LI>Throw loose needles in the trash; 
</LI><LI>Flush needles down the toilet; 
</LI><LI>Place needles in soda bottles, cans, or glass containers; or 
</LI><LI>Put sharps containers in the recycling bin.</LI></UL><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">Who is allowed to ship used sharps through the mail?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Homeowners and small quantity <mark>BMW</mark> generators (those who produce less than fifty pounds of sharps per month) may ship their used sharps via the mail. In CT, sharps are the only kind of <mark>BMW</mark> that may be shipped through the mail. This is usually accomplished via mail-back services that send a special container for their customers to use.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">Who can accept <mark>BMW</mark> from households?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Hospitals and regional hazardous waste collection facilities can legally accept <mark>BMW</mark> generated by households. Check first with a local hospital or your town to see if there is a facility that does so.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">Is <mark>BMW</mark> generated by visiting health care nurses at homes of patients regulated by the DEEP?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Yes. <mark>BMW</mark> generated in the home during the administration of medical care (e.g. sharps, IV bags, etc.) is regulated. We also encourage healthcare providers to accept <mark>BMW</mark> generated by their patients, since many patients lack knowledge of proper disposal techniques.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">How should <mark>BMW</mark> be disposed?</P></I></B><P align=""left""><mark>BMW</mark> must be packaged, labeled, and marked as required by state regulations. Generators and permitted <mark>BMW</mark> transporters must deliver the waste to a permitted &quot;<mark>BMW</mark> treatment facility&quot; to store, treat, or dispose the waste. The methods of treatment/ disposal are as follows:</P></LI><LI>Chemotherapy waste – by incineration 
</LI><LI>Pathological waste (i.e. human tissue, organs, body parts) – by incineration 
</LI><LI>Infectious waste (i.e. body fluids or items dripping with body fluids, discarded sharps, <mark>BMW</mark> generated from research, etc.) – either by incineration, discharge to a sanitary sewer, treatment by steam sterilization or other alternative treatment technology. </LI><P align=""left""><mark>BMW</mark> may be treated in accordance with methods specified in the regulations. If treated, <mark>BMW</mark> must be rendered unrecognizable in order to be disposed as municipal solid waste.</P><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">Can I dispose <mark>BMW</mark> in a sewer?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Yes, but chemotherapy and pathological waste must NOT be disposed in a sewer under any conditions. Only infectious wastes that are not pathological or generated from chemotherapy can be discharged to a sanitary sewer, provided the waste is in liquid or in semi-solid form, the sewage treatment plant does not prohibit the discharge and secondary treatment is provided and all discharge permits are obtained.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">What are CT’s <mark>BMW</mark> packaging and labeling requirements?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Before transporting <mark>BMW</mark>, the generator must:</P></LI><LI>Place the waste in a red bag to render it universally recognizable as <mark>BMW</mark>. 
</LI><LI>Package it in rigid, leak and moisture resistant containers. 
</LI><LI>Use a container that is strong enough to avert tearing or bursting under normal circumstances and seal it to prevent leakage. 
</LI><LI>Make sure each container displays the universal biohazard symbol or the words &quot;BIOHAZARD&quot; in large, easy-to-read lettering. 
</LI><LI>Never reuse a container that housed <mark>BMW</mark> for any purpose unless: 
</LI><LI>its surfaces were protected from contamination through the use of a liner or bag that was removed with the waste, or 
</LI><LI>it has been thoroughly washed and disinfected, with all visible traces of prior contamination removed.</LI></OL><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">How should <mark>BMW</mark> be stored?</P></I></B><P align=""left""><mark>BMW</mark> must be stored so that it avoids being mixed with other materials, and access to it must be limited to personnel authorized by the generator, transporter, or <mark>BMW</mark> treatment facility operator to handle it. Outdoor storage areas, such as dumpsters, sheds, or trailers, must be locked. The areas used for storage must be constructed of finished materials that are impermeable and can be easily maintained in a sanitary condition.</P><P align=""left""><mark>BMW</mark> storage should be in a manner and location that protects it from water, precipitation, wind, animals, and does not provide a breeding place or food source for insects or rodents. <mark>BMW</mark> may be refrigerated during storage to maintain a non-putrescent state. Finally, a sign displaying the universal biohazard symbol and/or the words &quot;BIOHAZARD&quot; must be posted wherever <mark>BMW</mark> is stored.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">What should be done with used <mark>BMW</mark> containers?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Disposable containers must be disposed with the <mark>BMW</mark>. Reusable containers must be cleaned and decontaminated prior to usage.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">Can other types of waste be mixed with <mark>BMW</mark>?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Yes, but with varying processing rules. If <mark>BMW</mark> is mixed with hazardous waste it is regulated as hazardous waste. Likewise, if it is mixed with radioactive waste it is subject to radioactive waste regulations. If <mark>BMW</mark> is mixed with other forms of solid waste, then the combined waste must be managed as <mark>BMW</mark>. However, properly treated <mark>BMW</mark> from approved treatment facilities that is physically unrecognizable may be disposed as municipal solid waste.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">Are <mark>BMW</mark> generators required to implement a written <mark>BMW</mark> Management Plan?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Yes. A <mark>BMW</mark> Management Plan must be written for each facility and contain policies and procedures for the segregation, mixture, treatment, and disposal of <mark>BMW</mark>. An OSHA Exposure Control Plan may suffice if it provides for these policies and procedures.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">May I transport / treat <mark>BMW</mark> without a permit in CT?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Any person in the business of transporting <mark>BMW</mark> must obtain a <mark>BMW</mark> transporter permit issued by the DEEP pursuant to RCSA section 22a-209-15(g). Homeowners and small quantity <mark>BMW</mark> generators may transport their own waste under specific conditions. See the <mark>BMW</mark> regulations for more details.</P><P align=""left""><mark>BMW</mark> treatment facilities located in CT must also obtain a DEEP permit. To receive the most current list of permitted transporters/ treatment facilities contact the DEEP or visit our website.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">What are the <mark>BMW</mark> tracking requirements?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">A generator who transports or offers for transport <mark>BMW</mark> must use the tracking form in Appendix 1 of RCSA section 22a-209-15 to track its movement from the site of generation to a permitted <mark>BMW</mark> treatment facility. It is necessary to prepare at least the number of copies that will provide the generator and each transporter with one copy, and the operator or each <mark>BMW</mark> treatment facility where the waste is headed with two copies. A transporter may not accept <mark>BMW</mark> without a tracking form. For exceptions to the rules and more detailed guidelines, see RCSA section 22a-209-15(h).</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">I am a licensed hazardous waste transporter. Do I need a separate permit to transport <mark>BMW</mark>?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Yes. CT requires separate permits for transporting hazardous and <mark>BMW</mark>.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">Are trauma scene responders subject to <mark>BMW</mark> requirements?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">No, but any <mark>BMW</mark> generated at the scene must be managed in accordance with the <mark>BMW</mark> regulations. Entities engaged in this business should provide appropriate training to their employees and contract with a licensed transporter to ensure compliance with current regulations.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">Are ambulance or emergency service vehicles allowed to transport <mark>BMW</mark> to any hospital?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Yes. Many hospitals accept <mark>BMW</mark> that comes in with the trauma victim. If the ambulance does not have the time or resources to transport <mark>BMW</mark>, emergency service vehicles may also take it to the hospital. If the hospital refuses to accept the waste, entities should either take it back to their own facility for eventual pickup by a <mark>BMW</mark> transporter or drop the waste off at a permitted treatment facility.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">Should hospitals let patients take home <mark>BMW</mark> (limbs, organs, etc.)?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">The DEEP is aware that hospitals may get requests from patients to take home their pathological waste for religious or other reasons. However, since hospitals bear the responsibility for <mark>BMW</mark> generated at its facility, allowing this practice places the public in danger of improper disposal. Hospitals should exercise caution and restraint when deciding on this delicate matter by doing their best to educate their patients about proper disposal techniques.</P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">What should be done to clean up a <mark>BMW</mark> spill?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Secure the spill area with personnel using protective equipment described in RCSA section 22a-209-15(e). Damaged containers and spilled <mark>BMW</mark> must be placed into red plastic bags that meet the requirements outlined in the regulations. Spill responders must decontaminate the affected area and take any other appropriate clean-up measures. Finally, any reusable equipment used in the clean-up process must be cleaned and decontaminated; non-reusable equipment must be appropriately bagged, and disposed. For more details call the DEEP’s Emergency Response and Spill Prevention Section at (860) 424-3024. </P></LI><LI><B><I><P align=""left"">What should I do if I come across suspected <mark>BMW</mark>?</P></I></B><P align=""left"">Do not handle the waste yourself.

He is a frequent visitor to countries in Asia and in particular Singapore.</P><P>He joined <mark>ABB</mark> in 2001 and was involved in managing communications around many of <mark>ABB</mark>’s corporate, management, financial and environmental issues prior to his current position. He trained as a journalist and spent seven years in newspaper and broadcast journalism.</P><P>In this exclusive interview with Eco-Business, he shares how sustainability has changed the way corporates approach businesses and what drives <mark>ABB</mark> to want to be one of the world’s leading organisations on sustainability.</P><H4><STRONG>You’ve been head of sustainability since 2006, and at <mark>ABB</mark> since 2001 so you’ve seen the company through more than a decade. Can you share with us how the concept of sustainability has evolved since those early days? </STRONG></H4><P>If I look back at sustainability in corporations, in the mid to late 90s it was quite clear that the NGOs were successful in holding bigger companies to account on their environmental performance. So for many MNCs like <mark>ABB</mark>, one of our priorities then was to get our house in order, get our processes cleaner, more efficient. We looked at reducing impact when we deployed various projects; it was a process of understanding our environment impact and about environmental sustainability.</P><P>As we crossed over the millennium into the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century, we started looking more at the social aspect. So we focused on human rights and labour issues. We also looked at the other part of the triple bottom line (of people, planet and profit) – which included the financial aspect.</P><H4><STRONG>How so? Can you elaborate?</STRONG></H4><P>Today, it’s quite clear when you look at <mark>ABB</mark>’s portfolio that a large proportion of our revenues come from products that help customers reduce their environmental impact. We’re making money from helping people help the environment, and we’ve been able to embed sustainability into all aspects of our business. </P><P>At the heart of this is some dedicated hard work by our research and development colleagues who have undertaken Life Cycle Analyses of more than 100 product groups, which result in us being able to communicate solid and reliable Environmental Product Declarations that itemize the environmental impact of every aspect of a product’s life-cycle – from extracting the raw material, manufacture, in use and recycling or disposal.</P><H4><STRONG>How has <mark>ABB</mark>’s approach to sustainability changed over this past decade?</STRONG></H4><P>About 10 years ago, for example, sustainability issues in the supply chain were not on our agenda. But slowly, it was creeping up the agenda for the power industry, and was even affecting industries such as sports manufacturing. It was something that <mark>ABB</mark> didn’t think applied to it in a critical way, but it became quite clear that what happened in the consumer industry will at some stage hit the capital goods market.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><H2 class=""quote"">“</H2><P>One area we are perhaps lacking is being recognised for our contributions to a better world. We have lots of opportunities to do this and base our story on solid data and evidence. I would never greenwash. My intention is that <mark>ABB</mark>’s stories are backed by solid data.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>So we began to convince colleagues who headed supply chain that we should have some sort of oversight. Over the last three years, we’ve been working with the head of supply chain and his team to implement a supplier sustainability programme and that trains our key suppliers, particularly in India and China, on the expectations we have.</P><P>This involves addressing issues such as how we expect them to behave on social, health, safety and basic things like labour rights, like paying people the right amount of money for the work they did. We started auditing and found that they were not complying in some areas, so we decided we would go higher up the chain and we implemented a training programme to ensure suppliers understood our expectations. So it’s still a work in progress.</P><P>Sustainability is a journey and not a destination. As long as we have some milestones on our route, and we have a positive direction, then we can make some progress. I would never claim that we’ve arrived at any of our objectives or KPIs – it’s an improvement process.</P><H4><STRONG>One of <mark>ABB</mark>’s objectives, as stated publicly, is to become recognised as one of the world’s leading organisations in sustainability – where is <mark>ABB</mark> on that journey? What are some challenges you forsee in fulfilling this vision?</STRONG></H4><P>Yes of course it’s a very ambitious target to be recognised as the world’s leading companies in <mark>sustainable</mark> practices. We certainly have pockets of excellence, and we are focused on minimizing and reducing our impact. I think our health and safety performance is probably not as mature as we expected and we will double our efforts in that area.</P><P>In areas such as supply chain sustainability, I think we are making good progress. For example, we are looking at suppliers in Malaysia in the coming year and adding to India, China and Mexico, we will also include the Middle East and Saudi Arabia.</P><P>In terms of community and local stakeholder engagement, we have set some minimum activity level and standards for that engagement. For example, we have developed a standard way to engage stakeholders in a formal dialogue so we can capture their inputs from a standardised process across different countries. </P><P>In addition, while we think we make some good contributions to local communities, we have developed a tool to help us identify appropriate causes to support and to measure the positive impact of that support. One area we are perhaps lacking is being recognised for our contributions to a better world. We have lots of opportunities to do this and base our story on solid data and evidence. I would never greenwash. My intention is that <mark>ABB</mark>’s stories are backed by solid data.</P><H4><STRONG>What motivates <mark>ABB</mark>? Not all engineering companies have this focus.</STRONG></H4><P>I’ll use a hackneyed anology. We’re pushing at an open door with regards to <mark>ABB</mark> and sustainability. There are inherent qualities and benefits in reducing energy use, optimising resource use, helping customers get more bangs for their buck… this addresses all three aspects – social, economic and environmental.</P><P>So for me, it’s not that <mark>ABB</mark> has to step outside normal business activities and think about being <mark>sustainable</mark>, it’s increasingly how we do things in <mark>ABB</mark> as a mainstream activity – a business imperative.</P><H4><STRONG>Have there been instances where <mark>ABB</mark> has had to make a tough decision between bottom line performance and sustainability environmental considerations? </STRONG></H4><P>Yes, there are some examples. Sustainability is a major consideration whenever we review projects. We have a seat at the table when major projects are being discussed, and we’ve looked at it from the technical, financial and sustainability point of view.</P><P>We have walked away from bidding on projects on the basis of concerns about human rights impact. If we are not necessarily going to be able to manage the risks, then we must consider the impact it will have on our reputation.</P><P>For instance, there was a small customer project where we were concerned about forced labour issues and we declined to supply products in the end. We have such a multitude of customers across the globe, and we are held to account to our most demanding of customers even if they’re not buying from us at the moment.</P><P>If we’re highlighted in the press as helping others abuse communities and human rights, others will start asking us what we’re doing, and we don’t want to have those conversations with our customers. Avoiding the hazard – instead of managing the risk – is the better option. But we are in the business to make money, so managing the risk – if it is not a ‘deal-breaker’-  is very often something that we might end up having to do.</P><P>We are also very thorough, open and honest in identifying the risks, and we have a plan on how best to mitigate them and that can involve social, environment, health and safety, or security aspects as well.</P><H4><STRONG>In Asia, where the awareness of sustainability is minimal in some developing countries, do you face difficulties talking about these issues to your suppliers and clients? How do you approach this?</STRONG></H4><P>In Asia, it’s extremely varied. The awareness level ranges from absolute zero to 100 per cent. It’s something that is relatively new in business anyway, but the awareness is growing. To me, it demonstrates how exceptionally fast companies in the region are in terms of learning these so-called ‘non-financial ’issues.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><H2 class=""quote"">“</H2><P>It’s a win-win. We tell them (suppliers): look after your people, be a good corporate citizen, and they also end up doing more business because other global companies will buy from them.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>They are concerned not because they want to be at the forefront of human rights development, but they understand that if you want to win a project, you must do it with considerations for human rights. That’s a “permission to do business” issue and a profitability issue. If you get projects wrong in countries like in India, for example, you can expect the local community to let you know in a direct way that they don’t like it. Some have been known to barricade your roads, and these disruptions cost money. It’s better if you assess what the critical issues are early and manage them with a plan.</P><P>With regards to our contractors and suppliers, we had a wake-up call about two years ago. We thought we would do a simple audit and address some non-compliance issues and get suppliers to fix it. But in some cases, you have to explain in very simple and basic terms what you expect them to do, such as it’s not okay to put polluted water into a drain or chuck your waste in a backyard where children can get injured.</P><P>But once you start talking to them about these topics, they are very fast to appreciate the value they bring to the business. We had one supplier in India who didn’t want to come to training, and didn’t want anything to do with our audit programmes. Eventually, we got them involved and a year later, they came back saying they were 20 per cent more productive. It’s a win-win. We tell them: look after your people, be a good corporate citizen, and they also end up doing more business because other global companies will buy from them.</P><P>We’re not on a crusade to correct all the ills in the global supply chain, but within our remit, we certainly want to improve capacity and performance.</P><H4><STRONG>Does <mark>ABB</mark>’s sustainability efforts help it win customers? How about in Asia?</STRONG></H4><P>I think it certainly does. We conducted a brand perception survey here and one of the things <mark>ABB</mark> was recognised for was corporate citizenship, so sustainability is linked to our brand as well as to power and <mark>innovation</mark>.</P><P>There’s much more we can do on the sustainability side. There are many on-going discussions now about <mark>sustainable</mark> development, and we have the technology to make it happen today, rather than tomorrow. Our strong credentials also helps us to conduct dialogue on these issues around the world.</P><H4><STRONG>How do you view <mark>ABB</mark>’s role in advancing sustainability in Singapore – and more broadly in Asia- given that it has become more important in this region?</STRONG></H4><P>We see it as a tremendous growth opportunity. There’s a lot more we can do in terms of the technologies and projects that we are involved globally, and there huge opportunities for similar projects in the region. Our solutions could help the region’s development tremendously. For example, in Indonesia, almost half the population do not have access to regular electricity so <mark>ABB</mark> can be quite central to that infrastructural development and we can raise sustainability in a number of ways through our projects.</P><H4><STRONG>You were a journalist before, so can you share what stories on <mark>ABB</mark>’s sustainability journey have stood out for you?</STRONG></H4><P>There are a couple – the community impact of <mark>ABB</mark> has been quite large and global, particularly in Asia. For example, the <mark>ABB</mark> Juergen Dormann Foundation was set up in 2007 to promote and support engineering education in different parts of the world.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><H2 class=""quote"">“</H2><P>Ultimately, the story about sustainability is that every day, when <mark>ABB</mark> people get up and go to work, they are making a contribution for a more <mark>sustainable</mark> world… We’re both making money and saving the planet. It’s a pretty good gig.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>It was set up to mark Dormann’s contribution in helping <mark>ABB</mark> turn the corner in early 2000. When he retired, <mark>ABB</mark> put several million dollars into a fund that would help educate students who come from poorer backgrounds in engineering. In South Asia, for example, we have relationships with three universities in Malaysia, India and Vietnam, and worldwide the foundation has supported 70 to 80 students gain degrees that they wouldn’t have been able to achieve otherwise.</P><P>Some of them have even come to work for <mark>ABB</mark>, so that’s a great closed loop. We make a contribution to educate an individual, and we benefit from a highly-skilled engineer who enters our workforce and makes a contribution. It’s truly heartwarming, and it also illustrates how there are business benefits to such programmes. It’s a win-win situation.</P><P>Ultimately, the story about sustainability is that every day, when <mark>ABB</mark> people get up and go to work, they are making a contribution for a more <mark>sustainable</mark> world, just through their work, in making products and solutions that are more energy efficient. We’re both making money and saving the planet.

Even the names of its seas and rivers are unfamiliar, though many are vast. Siberia's Yenisey and Lena each carries more water to the sea than the Mississippi or the Nile. Greenland, the world's biggest island, is six times the size of Germany. Yet it has a population of just 57,000, mostly Inuit scattered in tiny coastal settlements. In the whole of the Arctic—roughly defined as the Arctic Circle and a narrow margin to the south (see map)—there are barely 4m people, around half of whom live in a few cheerless post-Soviet cities such as Murmansk and Magadan. In most of the rest, including much of Siberia, northern Alaska, northern Canada, Greenland and northern Scandinavia, there is hardly anyone. Yet the region is anything but inviolate.</P><P><STRONG>Fast forward</STRONG></P><P>A heat map of the world, colour-coded for temperature change, shows the Arctic in sizzling maroon. Since 1951 it has warmed roughly twice as much as the global average. In that period the temperature in Greenland has gone up by 1.5°C, compared with around 0.7°C globally. This disparity is expected to continue. A 2°C increase in global temperatures—which appears inevitable as greenhouse-gas emissions soar—would mean Arctic warming of 3-6°C.</P><P>Almost all Arctic glaciers have receded. The area of Arctic land covered by snow in early summer has shrunk by almost a fifth since 1966. But it is the Arctic Ocean that is most changed. In the 1970s, 80s and 90s the minimum extent of polar pack ice fell by around 8% per decade. Then, in 2007, the sea ice crashed, melting to a summer minimum of 4.3m sq km (1.7m square miles), close to half the average for the 1960s and 24% below the previous minimum, set in 2005. This left the north-west passage, a sea lane through Canada's 36,000-island Arctic Archipelago, ice-free for the first time in memory.</P><P>Scientists, scrambling to explain this, found that in 2007 every natural variation, including warm weather, clear skies and warm currents, had lined up to reinforce the seasonal melt. But last year there was no such remarkable coincidence: it was as normal as the Arctic gets these days. And the sea ice still shrank to almost the same extent.</P><P>There is no serious doubt about the basic cause of the warming. It is, in the Arctic as everywhere, the result of an increase in heat-trapping atmospheric gases, mainly <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide released when fossil fuels are burned. Because the atmosphere is shedding less solar heat, it is warming—a physical effect predicted back in 1896 by Svante Arrhenius, a Swedish scientist. But why is the Arctic warming faster than other places?</P><P>Consider, first, how very sensitive to temperature change the Arctic is because of where it is. In both hemispheres the <mark>climate</mark> system shifts heat from the steamy equator to the frozen pole. But in the north the exchange is much more efficient. This is partly because of the lofty mountain ranges of Europe, Asia and America that help mix warm and cold fronts, much as boulders churn water in a stream. Antarctica, surrounded by the vast southern seas, is subject to much less atmospheric mixing.</P><P>The land masses that encircle the Arctic also prevent the polar oceans revolving around it as they do around Antarctica. Instead they surge, north-south, between the Arctic land masses in a gigantic exchange of cold and warm water: the Pacific pours through the Bering Strait, between Siberia and Alaska, and the Atlantic through the Fram Strait, between Greenland and Norway's Svalbard archipelago.</P><P>That keeps the average annual temperature for the high Arctic (the northernmost fringes of land and the sea beyond) at a relatively sultry -15°C; much of the rest is close to melting-point for much of the year. Even modest warming can therefore have a dramatic effect on the region's ecosystems. The Antarctic is also warming, but with an average annual temperature of -57°C it will take more than a few hot summers for this to become obvious.</P><P><STRONG>The albedo effect</STRONG></P><P>The efficient north-south mixing of air may also play a part in the Arctic's amplified warming. The winds that rush northwards carry pollutants, including soot from European and Asian smokestacks, which has a powerful warming effect over snow. In recent decades there has also been a rise in levels of mercury, a by-product of burning coal, in the tissues of beluga whales, walruses and polar bears, all of which the Inuit eat. This is another reason why the Arctic is not virgin.</P><P>But the main reason for Arctic amplification is the warming effect of replacing light-coloured snow and ice with darker-coloured land or water. Because dark surfaces absorb more heat than light ones, this causes local warming, which melts more snow and ice, revealing more dark land or water, and so on. Known as the albedo effect, this turns out to be a more powerful positive feedback than most researchers had expected. Most <mark>climate</mark> models predicted that the Arctic Ocean could be ice-free in summer by the end of this century; an analysis published in 2009 in <EM class=""Italic"">Geophysical Research Letters</EM> suggested it might happen as early as 2037. Some now think it will be sooner.</P><P>It is hard to exaggerate how dramatic this is. Perhaps not since the felling of America's vast forests in the 19th century, or possibly since the razing of China's and western Europe's great forests a thousand years before that, has the world seen such a spectacular environmental change. The consequences for Arctic ecosystems will be swingeing.</P><P>As their ancient ice buffers vanish, Arctic coastlines are eroding; parts of Alaska are receding at 14 metres (45 feet) a year. Niche habitats, such as meltwater pools on multi-year ice, are dwindling. Some highly specialised Arctic species will probably become extinct as their habitats shrink and southern interlopers rush in. Others will thrive. The early signs of this biological reshuffle are already evident. High-Arctic species, including the polar bear, are struggling. Species new to the region, such as mackerel and Atlantic cod, are coming up in Arctic trawler nets. Yet the shock waves of Arctic change will be felt much more widely.</P><P>Melting sea ice will not affect global sea levels, because floating ice displaces its own mass in seawater. But melting glaciers will, and the Arctic's are shedding ice at a great rate. Greenland's ice cap is losing an estimated 200 gigatonnes of ice a year, enough to supply a billion people with water. The Arctic's smaller ice caps and glaciers together are losing a similar amount. Before this became clear, the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC) had predicted a sea-level rise of up to 59cm during this century. Given what is happening up north, many now think this too modest.</P><DIV class=""pullquote"">Melting sea ice will not affect global sea levels, because floating ice  displaces its own mass in seawater. But melting glaciers will</DIV><P>A wilder fear is that a deluge of Arctic meltwater could disrupt the mighty “overturning circulation” of the global oceans, the exchange of warm tropical and cold polar water. It has happened before, at least seven times in the past 60,000 years, and needs watching. But recent evidence suggests that such a calamity is not imminent. Another concern, that thawing Arctic permafrost could release vast quantities of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and methane, looms larger. That, too, has happened before, around 55m years ago, leading to a global temperature increase of 5°C in a few thousand years.</P><P>Such risks are hard to pin down, and possibly small. Many elements of the change in the Arctic, including the rates of snow melt and glacier retreat, are still within the range of historical variations. Yet the fact that the change is man-made is unprecedented, which introduces huge uncertainty about how far and fast it will proceed. For those minded to ignore the risks, it is worth noting that even the more extreme predictions of Arctic warming have been outpaced by what has happened in reality.</P><P><STRONG>Riches of the north</STRONG></P><P>In the long run the unfrozen north could cause <mark>devastation</mark>. But, paradoxically, in the meantime no Arctic species will profit from it as much as the one causing it: humans. Disappearing sea ice may spell the end of the last Eskimo cultures, but hardly anyone lives in an igloo these days anyway. And the great melt is going to make a lot of people rich.</P><DIV class=""content-image-float clearfix"" style=""width: 290px;""><SPAN class=""caption"">Watch our <A href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/09/melting-arctic-sea-ice-and-shipping-routes""><STRONG>animation</STRONG></A> of the receding Arctic ice-shelf and the shipping routes it could unlock</SPAN></DIV><P>As the frozen tundra retreats northwards, large areas of the Arctic will become suitable for agriculture. An increasingly early Arctic spring could increase plant growth by up to 25%. That would allow Greenlanders to grow more than the paltry 100 tonnes of potatoes they manage now. And much more valuable materials will become increasingly accessible. The Arctic is already a big source of minerals, including zinc in Alaska, gold in Canada, iron in Sweden and nickel in Russia, and there is plenty more to mine.</P><P>The Arctic also has oil and gas, probably lots. Exploration licences are now being issued across the region, in the United States, Canada, Greenland, Norway and Russia. On April 18th ExxonMobil finalised the terms of a deal with Russia's <mark>Rosneft</mark> to invest up to $500 billion in developing offshore reserves, including in Russia's Arctic Kara sea. Oil companies do not like to talk about it, but this points to another positive feedback from the melt. <mark>Climate change</mark> caused by burning fossil fuels will allow more Arctic hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s to be extracted and burned.</P><P>These new Arctic industries will not emerge overnight. There is still plenty of sea ice to make the north exceptionally tough and expensive to work in; 24-hour-a-day winter darkness and Arctic cyclones make it tougher still. Most of the current exploration is unlikely to lead to hydro<mark>carbon</mark> production for a decade at least. But in time it will happen. The prize is huge, and oil companies and Arctic governments are determined to claim it. Shortly before the ExxonMobil-<mark>Rosneft</mark> deal was announced, Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, announced plans to make it much more attractive for foreigners to invest in Russian offshore energy production. “Offshore fields, especially in the Arctic, are without any exaggeration our strategic reserve for the 21st century,” he said.</P><P>For half the 20th century the Arctic, as the shortest route between Russia and America, was the likeliest theatre for a nuclear war, and some see potential for fresh conflict in its opening. Russia and Canada, the two biggest Arctic countries by area, have encouraged this fear: the Arctic stirs fierce nationalist sentiment in both. With a new regard to their northern areas, some of the eight Arctic countries are, in a modest way, remilitarising them. Norway shifted its military command centre to the Arctic town of Reitan in 2009. Russia is replacing and upgrading its six nuclear icebreakers, a piece of civilian infrastructure with implications for security too. Yet this special report will suggest that warnings about Arctic conflict are, like the <mark>climate</mark>, overcooked.</P><P>The Arctic is no <EM class=""Italic"">terra nullius</EM>. Unlike Antarctica, which is governed by an international treaty, most of it is demarcated. Of half a dozen territorial disputes in the region, the biggest is probably between the United States and Canada, over the status of the north-west passage. Those two countries will not go to war. And the majority of Arctic countries are members of NATO.</P><P>Yet the melting Arctic will have geostrategic consequences beyond helping a bunch of resource-fattened countries to get fatter. An obvious one is the potentially disruptive effect of new trade routes. Sailing along the coast of Siberia by the north-east passage, or Northern Sea Route (NSR), as Russians and mariners call it, cuts the distance between western Europe and east Asia by roughly a third. The passage is now open for four or five months a year and is getting more traffic. In 2010 only four ships used the NSR; last year 34 did, in both directions, including tankers, refrigerated vessels carrying fish and even a cruise liner.</P><P>Asia's big exporters, China, Japan and South Korea, are already investing in ice-capable vessels, or planning to do so. For Russia, which has big plans to develop the sea lane with trans-shipment hubs and other infrastructure, this is a double boon. It will help it get Arctic resources to market faster and also, as the NSR becomes increasingly viable, diversify its hydro<mark>carbon</mark>-addicted economy.</P><P>There are risks in this, of dispute if not war, which will require management. What is good for Russia may be bad for Egypt, which last year earned over $5 billion in revenues from the Suez Canal, an alternative east-west shipping route. So it is good that the regional club, the Arctic Council, is showing promise. Under Scandinavian direction for the past half-decade, it has elicited an impressive amount of Arctic co-operation, including on scientific research, mapping and resource development.</P><P>Yet how to reconcile the environmental risks of the melting Arctic with the economic opportunities it will present? The shrinkage of the sea ice is no less a result of human hands than the ploughing of the prairies. It might even turn out as lucrative. But the costs will also be huge. Unique ecosystems, and perhaps many species, will be lost in a tide of environmental change. The cause is global <mark>pollution</mark>, and the risks it carries are likewise global. The Arctic, no longer distant or inviolable, has emerged, almost overnight, as a powerful symbol of the age of man.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,1.0,Negative

In 2015, 167 million gallons of drop-in fuels were produced, primarily from AltAir Fuels, of Los Angeles California (vegetable oils, fats, greases), and Diamond Green Diesel of Norco, Louisiana (vegetable oils, fats, greases).</P><P>New facilities are coming on-line with one drop-in facility expecting to be operational in 2016, and four in 2017. They include Cool Planet Energy Systems of Alexandria, Louisiana; Emerald Biofuels, of Plaquemine, Louisiana; Fulcrum BioEnergy of Reno, Nevada; and KiOR, of Columbus, Missouri.  The operational or planned drop-in facilities use either hydrotreating or thermochemical processes. Hydrotreating is a process that is commonly used in the petroleum refining industry; and thermochemical processes use oxygen-deprived, high heat environments to convert feedstocks to fuels. </P><P>Despite the aura of “phantom fuels” surrounding cellulosic and drop-in fuels, the commercial investments in these facilities shows that the advanced biofuels industry is nascent, but growing.  Investors note that stable U.S. policy is critical.  Since the EPA proposed lowering the volume of renewable fuels in 2013, no commercial-scale cellulosic facility has been planned in the United States. New investments by the cellulosic industry are currently being made in China, Europe, and Brazil.   </P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1.0,1.0,Negative

(12)</P><P>But internationally, the company is unlikely to face repercussions: one of its former executives practically wrote the rule book for the global food trade. Daniel Amstutz, President of Cargill Investor Services from 1972 to 1978, was the US chief negotiator for agriculture in the Uruguay round of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations.</P><P>The GATT Uruguay round is widely regarded as representing the most substantial liberalisation of world trade in agricultural products and paved the way for the creation of the World Trade Organization. It also brought agriculture into the global patent regime. Amstutz returned to agribusiness as a consultant soon after, but the revolving door continued to turn...</P><P> </P><H3>The Corporate Colonisation of Iraq </H3><P>Amstutz popped up again as a diplomat in post-invasion Iraq in 2003, placed in charge of the ‘reconstruction’ of Iraqi agriculture, much to the outrage of the international community. Oxfam’s policy director Kevin Watson said: “Putting Dan Amstutz in charge of agricultural reconstruction in Iraq is like putting Saddam Hussein in the chair of a human rights commission... This guy is uniquely well-placed to advance the commercial interests of American grain companies and bust open the Iraqi market – but singularly ill-equipped to lead a reconstruction effort in a developing country”. (13)</P><P>Cargill cashed in on the post-invasion US administration’s abolition of taxes and tariffs on imported products, fooding the market with hundreds of thousands of tonnes of wheat. According to journalist Greg Palast, “For Iraqi farmers, already wounded by sanctions and war, this was devastating. They could not compete with the US and Australian surplusses dumped on them”. (14)</P><P> </P><H3>The Food Aid Industry:</H3><P><STRONG>Greed feeding Hunger</STRONG></P><P>Food aid is big business. In the USA, it has accounted for 15% of rice exports and 12% of wheat exports over the last two decades.15 Cargill has been a big benefciary: since the 1950s it has become the main contractor of US food aid funded under Public Law 480. (16)</P><P>It has been estimated that seven out of ten countries receiving this aid went on to become seven of the ten best customers for US grain.17 The US aid programme has allowed Cargill to get rid of surpluses of GM crops rejected by Europe. This has created a dangerous situation of dependency for peasant farmers worldwide.</P><P>Writing in 2000, when Ethiopia was on the brink of a famine in which eight million people faced starvation, Michel Chossudovsky described how the policies of international fnancial institutions and US biotech corporations, including Cargill, had sowed the seeds of famine in the frst place.  A key element of this was the contamination of indigenous seeds and landraces with genetically engineered food aid. (18)</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Deforestation and biofuels </STRONG></P><P>Wherever there is an agricultural commodity with notorious issues associated with it – such as cocoa and cotton, with endemic problems of child labour in their supply chains – it seems you find Cargill. Perhaps it is no surprise, then, that Cargill is a key player in the global palm oil trade. It owns plantations, exports the product and also, through various companies, imports and trades it in the USA.</P><P>It is the USA’s biggest palm oil importer. (19)  In 2003 the company claimed that it exported 11% of Indonesian crude palm oil. (20) Palm oil production in Indonesia and elsewhere has had a devastating effect on local communities and environments, while the associated deforestation and the destruction of peatland is a major contributor to <mark>climate change</mark>. In 2007 Greenpeace reported that Indonesia had become the world’s third largest greenhouse gas emitter, behind only the USA and China.

The <mark>Ineos</mark> majority shareholder, Jim Ratcliffe, claims fracking could regenerate northern Britain despite evidence that the strategy is “a mirage that would lead to a mountain of debt and a mountain of garbage”.</STRONG></EM></P><P><EM>Base Fortune, now I see, that in thy wheel
There is a point, to which when men aspire,
They tumble headlong down..</EM></P><P>– Christopher Marlowe – from his play “Edward the Second”</P><P>Let’s start with the BIG STORY. Any PR or advertising agency will tell their clients that they have to have a story. The story can amuse, stimulate or inspire. The aim of this is to emotionally engage with the public or a market segment. They are invited to identify with the story, to become a part of it, to share in the action.</P><P>For example, here’s a story in just two letters and two words: “BP” meaning “Beyond Petroleum”. It explained how that company saw its future. OK, the story went, we are a fossil fuel company – but we are trying to move in the right direction – so fill up at a BP station before we’ve got the solar panels in place. OK? </P><P>Then, in 2010, disaster struck the Beyond Petroleum story in the Gulf of Mexico. A vast marine eco-system was trashed by a  leaking well drilled from a BP Platform called “Deepwater Horizon”. A huge media storm focused on the shoddy reality behind the slogan “Beyond Petroleum”. BP was now perceived as a reckless and aggressive company that played little heed to safety or environment. In this media storm Tony Hayward, the Chief Executive of BP, made it worse for the company and himself. Someone leaked that in a private meeting he had asked his fellow executives: “What the hell did we do to deserve this?”. He was thereafter repeatedly asked how could he ask such a stupid question.</P><P>PR, if based on a flawed story, or on a lie, has a way of turning against those who attempt to make use of it.</P><H2>The <mark>Ineos</mark> Saga</H2><P>So what is the inspiring story for <mark>Ineos</mark> – the company 2/3 owned by the Beverley Grammar School Boy made good, long distant runner, team leader, international business magnate Jim Ratcliffe?  Many people will remember Ratcliffe and his company as the one that moved its HQ to Switzerland to avoid paying UK taxes so it has struggled with its PR – however, nowadays Ratcliffe and <mark>Ineos</mark> want to be associated with another story and this article is about having a critical look at it. This is the narrative in which, by supporting the fracking of shale, Britain will gain a cheap new energy source that will revive manufacturing, leading to the regeneration of large parts of the north of England and of Scotland. </P><P>By combining £600 million of <mark>Ineos</mark> money with the fracking expertise that they have bought in from the USA, and adding these together with the ” understanding of extractive industries” that communities in the North of England possess after coal mining… great things can happen. Jobs. Industry.  Who knows, perhaps <mark>Ineos</mark> might pay some tax too…
But what’s really going to happen? Every good story has high stakes and an uncertain ending. There’s no dramatic tension otherwise. As the Hero embarks on the great journey there are challenges and doubts over whether they will succeed. To add tension the tests and challenges, the rewards and risks get bigger. In the <mark>Ineos</mark> saga it started as an innovating entrepreneur creating a new company. The name of <mark>Ineos</mark> is derived from Greek words conveying <mark>innovation</mark> and newness. Now, many years later, the story is whether the company will go bust – or whether it will become the saviour of Northern Britain’s industrial legacy. </P><P>There are different kinds of stories. In one kind the apparent hero is found wanting. Some stories are about hubris – about people who overestimate themselves, discover limits that they did not know existed, find themselves in a spot of difficulty, perhaps gambling to escape their predicament – and it all ends unhappily. To be a really good tragedy the chief protagonist does not just make practical and strategic mistakes. The story ends badly because ethical or moral tests are failed too.</P><H2>The <mark>Ineos</mark> Gamble</H2><P>In the <mark>Ineos</mark> story there is no certainty about the ending either. The desire to frack in the UK is an expensive gamble and it could go wrong in lots of different ways. Here are a few of those ways: </P><P>There could be insufficient gas for fracking to be commercially viable.  In Poland in 2011 there was an idea that there was about to be a shale gas bonanza. 75 exploratory wells were sunk. 25 were fracked and although gas was found the flow was between 10% and 33% of what would be needed for commercial viability. So the gas exploration companies lost interest. If that were to happen to <mark>Ineos</mark> in the UK it would be a disaster for them in this country. Instead of <mark>Ineos</mark> making northern Britain Great Again it could easily go bust like it nearly did shortly after the financial crisis of 2008. Here’s why…</P><P><mark>Ineos</mark> is a business empire constructed out of the pieces that other petro-chemical companies didn’t want – where the pieces for the construction were paid for by borrowing. That’s why their company propaganda is not only full of stuff about their technological prowess but about their skill at handling their finances . They are proud of their ability to juggle with their debt arrangements. It’s also why they are so desperate to get cheap UK feedstock and cheap energy for their chemical operations at Grangemouth and Runcorn. Cheap gas in the USA extracted by fracking has been useful to them in their operations there. They are trying to survive in a global market and want cheap gas, extracted on the spot, for their UK operations too. They are prepared to gamble money on the hope that this is possible.  If they don’t get that cheap gas they not only lose that investment, they are stuck with the problem of how to find cheap energy and ethane as North Sea gas fields decline.</P><P>There is massive overcapacity in the chemicals industry as the chart shows. When there is overcapacity in an industry there is fierce competition. Each company tries to ensure that it is their business rivals that suffer from idle production facilities while they succeed in keeping busy. A glut of products pushes down prices –  which, in this case, means a glut of plastics. The name of the game is not expansion – it is survival – so that other companies go out of business and not the one that you are running. </P><P>While <mark>Ineos</mark> are telling us about regeneration, expansion and jobs, in their private business discussions they will probably be talking about what how to deal with an ageing population and stagnant markets for generic products, about how to deal with competitors in other countries producing the same products but with lower energy costs, about Chinese competition and about what to do in a recession. They will also be discussing what to do if, as looks increasingly likely, there is another credit crunch like 2007-2008. <mark>Ineos</mark> are still dependent on debt finance. </P><P>To repeat, <mark>Ineos</mark> want to frack to reduce their costs of production because they are in a corner. Ratcliffe may want to believe himself the regenerator of the North of Britain – that he will win through against the odds, that he will prove wrong any people who doubted him along the way  – but some chemical companies are likely to go out of business. The way it’s going one of them could be his.</P><H2>Where the <mark>Ineos</mark> fantasy comes from</H2><P>The international chemicals industry in general and plastics in particular are in a hyper competitive state.  In a hyper competitive state <mark>Ineos</mark> are disadvantaged by energy prices in Europe that are higher than elsewhere in the world. In 2011 <mark>Ineos</mark> testified to the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee that there was a problem with a high <mark>carbon</mark> price in the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme. It would make British and European companies that use a lot of energy uncompetitive with places like China. There was a danger, they argued, that their competitors outside Europe would win.  The emissions would occur in China rather than Britain and Europe and they might be driven out of business. We have an important role in “the Green Economy” they claimed, pointing at their development of technological  processes to develop fuel and electricity from municipal waste. However there had to be a way of squaring the circle on European <mark>climate policy</mark> – because all that was happening was that European policy was driving high energy (= high <mark>carbon</mark>) industrial operations like chemicals and plastics to China where the greenhouse gas emissions of production were even higher than in Britain and Europe. The chemicals, plastics and industrial products were being exported back to Europe and companies like <mark>Ineos</mark> were losing markets.</P><P>That was in 2011 and the story moved on. <mark>Ineos</mark> companies in the USA were finding their costs lowered by using gas from fracking and Ratcliffe and his management team were looking to import that gas into the UK by building ships especially designed to carry liquified gas. But this was only an imperfect interim solution for the <mark>Ineos</mark> UK operations.  While cheap in America the gas is not so cheap for <mark>Ineos</mark> over here after paying the toll for liquifying it and the costs of transporting it.  A far better solution for the needs of <mark>Ineos</mark> seemed to be for the UK to develop its own fracking industry seemed to be..  The North Sea as the major UK source for natural gas is in decline but the big idea now was that onshore gas from fracking would not only revive the fortunes of <mark>Ineos</mark> but of all energy intensive economic sectors. That has been the apparent epiphany – under the leadership of Ratcliffe a grandiose vision of industrial regeneration was born.  However, to be missionaries for shale and fracking, you have to brush the problems under a carpet.</P><P>According to Ratcliffe, quoted in the <EM>Guardian</EM>, “a lot of the opposition to fracking is based on hearsay and rumour”. In fact there are now nearly 700 academic articles published between 2009 and the end of 2015 about fracking, public health and the environment. The overwhelming majority of the studies that contain field data show potential or actual contamination of water or air. 31 of the studies assess the dangers to public health – <A href=""http://www.psehealthyenergy.org/site/view/1233"">26 of them indicate public health hazards, elevated risks or adverse health outcomes. http://www.psehealthyenergy.org/site/view/1233</A></P><H2>Decision making under conditions of uncertainty – making up your mind and then sticking to it</H2><P>It is difficult to be sure without knowing him a lot better how Ratcliffe came to say and apparently believe that opposition to fracking is based on hearsay. It brings to mind the comment of BP’s Tony Hayward mentioned earlier. It raises interesting questions about how aware and self aware are many “captains of industry”. One of the most interesting sides of economic theory which overlaps with human psychology is  decision making under conditions of uncertainty.  That’s decision making where you know some things, where you think you know some things and where there are a lot of things that you don’t know. Daniel Kahneman, who won what is called the Nobel Prize for Economics, has particularly focused on this. For Kahneman a crucial feature of good decision making is not to overestimate the importance and significance of what you think that you know – while at the same time underestimating what you don’t know. This is very difficult because people construct their interpretation of the world from what they know. Indeed they may feel particularly proud of their specialist and professional knowledge. They may feel that it gives them unique and special insights, have an expertise that other people lack that makes them THE industry experts on a particular matter. In the anti fracking struggle one sees this all the time from some rather arrogant engineers and geologists who feel that they are uniquely qualified to opine on fracking (or indeed other topics too )– not acknowledging that environmental scientists, public health professionals, economists, <mark>climate</mark> scientists and many others each have professional and scientific angles on the matter that is also worthy of consideration and respect. In Germany there is even a special name for this kind of person – a Fachidiot – where Fach means a specialist subject discipline and idiot means idiot – a greek word for someone who focused exclusively on their private interests and did not take an interest in wider politics and public affairs.  </P><P>Of course everyone tends to underestimate what they don’t know in favour of what they do know (or think they know). It is not just a problem among frackademics. In his book, <EM>Thinking Fast and Slow</EM>, Kahneman labels the common fallacy that underpins most of how we interpret and decide about things – he calls it the WYSIATI  fallacy – What You See Is All There Is.  It is related to “optimism bias” and “planning fallacy” – assuming things will work as we plan them, on time and on budget, because of not realising that there will always be unknown unknowns to drive us off track. This “optimism bias” is a feature too of expectations for health and safety and environmental consequences. Other people call this Murphy’s Law. If things can go wrong then eventually they will. And they sure as hell will for <mark>Ineos</mark> too.</P><P>Of course what we see is not all there is – the German philosopher Heidegger describes our experience of being in the world with the metaphor of being in a clearing in a forest – what we see are what’s in the clearing but beyond that things remain unknown to us. (“Die Lichtung des Seins” in German – where Lichtung means clearing and Sein means ‘being’. It is helpful perhaps to notice that in German the word Lichtung contains the word  Licht – light, that which illuminates). Others speak of a “cloud of unknowing”. In different circumstances politicians and military types speak of the “fog of war”.  To get a proper sense of where we are really, it helps to realise that we are lost. Yet there are some kinds of people who have to give the appearance of knowing just where they are, and exactly what they are doing all the time, otherwise these wizards would freak the markets and scare away the people who follow their leadership and lend them money. Then there is a certain kind of stupid economist who claims that, while each individual only has a partial view, all market actors together have the complete view and thus hypothesize the existence of perfect markets. And in perfect markets clever entrepreneurs like Jim Ratcliffe collectively make the right decisions. Everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds in this world view – earlier mocked by Voltaire’s in the philosophy of his character Dr Pangloss.  The problem with this view is that when you give people the idea that they could be infallible then, after a run of luck, they start overesstimating themselves, ignore their critics and set themselves and other people up for some disastrous mistakes. This is the hubris story by the way – the ones that the leaders of BP set themselves up for. </P><H2>Groupthink – why corporate leaders and politicans ignore evidence once they have made up their minds</H2><P>Managers spend their time trying to work out how to develop their business, and how to survive in a competitive market, are of course aware that they must devote some of their attention to health and safety and environmental issues. What a shame then that devoting attention to such matters competes for their time with many other things to be resolved and strategies that need to be worked on. Of course business strategies must embrace as much information as possible – but once you are embarked on a strategy, and above all, once you have made the public declarations and started to raise and commit millions in investment, then you cannot easily change your mind. You cannot keep chopping and changing. This is even more the case if you have borrowed a lot of money to advance  your strategy. For your own psychological peace of mind too it will not do to start doubting decisions that involve a lot of money, a lot of creditors. These decisions also underpin your relationships with your management team who are pursuing the same plan, not to mention your relationships with the rest of the workforce. </P><P>Academics, activists can chop and change and try to get to the bottom of things – but for the captains of industry there are powerful pressures to retain their focus even if real life reveals a host of issues that they did not know at first – indeed that could not know at first. That’s why, as they plough ahead with their business strategies, the temptation must sometimes be to pull down blinkers.  The more that you have at stake and already committed the greater the psychological pressure to refuse to acknowledge inconvenient new information that is telling you a mistake has been made.</P><P>In this regard one of the psychological insights of Kahneman is that decision makers who are trapped start gambling. When all options seembad the attempt to escape seems to justify taking great risks that would otherwise not be taken. In current circumstances <mark>Ineos</mark> operations in Europe are trapped by high energy and feedstock costs and the shale gas “solution” to their problems is a big commitment of resources that is a gamble to try to break themselves free and restore their ability to compete internationally. The relevant insight from this is that they are likely to want to play this all the way through, despite the low chances of success because there are no other options. In this situation, their willingness of accepting any new information about health and environment risks to anyone else might be reduced.</P><P>The ability to sustain gambles like this will be buttressed when supported by a wider network of interests.  A vested interest coalition is involved too. The larger group has also refused to review its earlier decisions and to admit that they were wrong too or to take in new information. The prospect of losing credibility and making a humiliating U turn is very offputting. Politicians, many engineering and geologist academics, as well as specialist officials often have long standing collegiate relationships. It is not surprising that this wider circle are still trotting out the message from the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering.  <mark>Ineos</mark> PR use the Royal Academy and RAE’s report as well as a very partial report by Public Health England on the limited topic of “fracking emissions”. However these were written very early and before most of the peer reviewed academic articles about public health, environmental and <mark>climate</mark> concerns started flooding  out of other departments of the universities. The later studies have not matched up with the earlier group think that geologists and engineers had said about safety. However these earlier reports by specialist academics writing partly out of their subject areas have given the cover thatis still cited as evidence for the faith that holds the frackers together. These reports still “prove” safety and they are clearly too complacent. They are still too focused on what geologists assume might be the problems – deep underground, underplaying a host of problems on the surface, issues of scale and wider gas field development, in addition to a long standing problem of well integrity. This has made it necessary for anti fracking campaigners to fight an arrogant group think that is now very dangerous.</P><P>It is thus interesting to compare what is happening with what happened earlier in the organisation that embraced the empty rhetoric of “Beyond Petroleum” under the leadership of CEO John Browne and then of Tony Hayward. According to Johan Sachs</P><P><EM>“As John Browne rose to the zenith of his global esteem, groupthink descended upon BP’s core leadership team like a thick fog. Red flags about safety concerns flew everywhere in the form of external and internal investigations and even massive government fines. Browne and his men, including Hawyard, optimistically responded with superficial fixes, believing their measures could address deeper safety issues while keeping oil flowing at maximum rates. Whistleblowers tried desperately to get executives to maintain safety equipment  and top talent resigned in protest when they did. When Hayward took over, the leadership team spent countless hours discussing plans to reorient its approach to safety even as they increased the riskiness of the projects that they undertook. From the inside, it all looked perfectly normal.”</EM> (Johan Sachs “Winning the Story Wars” <EM>Harvard Business Review Press</EM>, 2012 p221 )</P><P>Cohesive groups with a strong leader will often ignore or punish dissenting opinions. They can do it too because they have the backing of government and are given cover by frackademics and are able to play fast and loose with reality. In fact in the media and in their PR they create a fantasy world for everyone else that suits them.  There are psychological mechanisms available to keep the deeper and threatening reality out of the centre of their consciousness. Freud called it “Verdraengung” which means pushing an idea or truth away, not bringing it into the centre of conscioussness to get an appropriate amount of attention. (Verdraengung is usually wrongly translated as “repressing” in psychoanalytical literature). Yet when Ratcliffe tells a major national newspaper that the opposition to fracking is based on hearsay there is probably some dim level at which he is uneasily aware that what he is saying can be challenged. Is he unaware that the US company with which he has a 15 year contract for the supply shale gas, Range Resource, has been accused of causing a number of environmental incidents? It seems implausible that he does not know that Range Resource have paid nearly $15 million in <mark>pollution</mark> fines in recent years.  This included an $8.9 million fine which was the biggest ever for a shale gas drilling related environmental violation in Pennsylvania as well as a $4.15 million fine for violations at 6 waste water impoundments[1].</P><P>So what is going on in the mind of Ratcliffe when he claims that opposition to fracking is based on hearsay?  Is he not aware that one reason that more information and evidence against fracking does not exist are the gagging orders imposed on victims after financial settlements? In August 2013 this included a gagging order on 2 children by his partner Range Resource – the children were <A href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/aug/05/children-ban-talking-about-fracking"">banned from talking about fracking for the rest of their lives</A>.</P><P>Is Ratcliffe really unaware of these things? He ought to be sensitised to issues of children’s health because in Ohio in 2009 his company was obliged to share a $1.3 million fine for multiple violations at the <mark>Ineos</mark> chemical facility at Addyston. It was a case associated with hazardous air pollutants like acrylontrile, butadiene and styrene and an elementary school had to be relocated because of the air <mark>pollution</mark> risk to school children.</P><H2>Instrumentalising children’s health to pursue a corporate agenda that will damage children’s health</H2><P>At the time of writing Ratcliffe is sponsoring long distance running by schoolchildren in a Go Run for Fun initiative. Ratcliffe is a keen long distance runner but if he and his company were keen on public health they would not be accusing opponents of fracking of basing themselves on hearsay. The dangers are well documented. It is not rumour or hearsay that 40 of 46 peer reviewed scientific studies between 2009 and 2015 show actual or potential negative effects to air quality. It is unlikely to help children’s health to run through an <mark>Ineos</mark> gasfield.  </P><P>The effect of fracking derived air <mark>pollution</mark> on the health of pregnant women and their babies should give him cause for concern too. In June of 2015 a peer reviewed University of Pittsburgh study linked fracking to low birthweight in three heavily drilled Pennsylvania counties. The more wells, and the closer the wells to where the pregnant mother lived, the greater the risk. The study did not investigate mechanisms but is authors thought air <mark>pollution</mark> was the likely route of exposure – as evidenced by another West Pennsylvania study.[2]</P><P>So what kind of person and company is it that appears to champion the health of children while simultaneously making partnerships with companies that gag children and while promoting an industry that is a threat to their health? What kind of corporate ethics are we dealing with that  denies the evidence, claims opposition is based on hearsay and spends a vast amount on corporate propaganda?</P><H2>Plastic <mark>Pollution</mark> – ethical bankrupcy is worse than financial bankrupcy</H2><P>It is not only that if <mark>Ineos</mark> goes ahead it will impose a host of public health and environmental risks on local communities and on the <mark>climate</mark> system. It is also that the products that they intend to make with the ethane and methane that they want to extract would be disastrous too. For example they want to make plastic with it. As they are in the plastic business they must know that plastic is not the innocent stuff that most people unwittingly think of it as being.</P><P>Far worse than bankruptcy would be to go down in history as having produced a stream of toxins that play a significant role in destroying the global ecological system. It is one of the boasts of <mark>Ineos</mark> that it is the third largest player among the global chemicals companies. This being does it not have the third largest responsibility for what is currently an unfolding ecological catastrophe whose source is oil and gas and the many chemicals and plastics made from them? True, the <mark>Ineos</mark> Bio subsidiary is developing ways of recycling municipal waste into fuel and electricity. That can be testified in their defence. However alone the stream of plastics produced by <mark>Ineos</mark> is an ecological catastrophe.</P><P>There are plenty of people who will remember a world where plastics had far fewer uses. In the living memory of millions of people it was not routinely used for wrapping food; for containers; for beverage and mineral water bottles; for shopping and other bags; for lids; for disposable cups, plates, knives forks and spoons; for straws, stirrers, balloons, party inflatables. Somehow humanity managed to survive day to day with old fashioned glass bottles, ceramics and objects that were designed to be used over and again, rather than to be thrown away. Somehow people did not notice what they were missing before technology progressed, plastic was mass produced and business empires like <mark>Ineos</mark> were developed in order produce a stream of trash.  As if <mark>climate change</mark> were not bad enough we now have in plastic <mark>pollution</mark> another slowly evolving disaster. That’s because plastic may break up in the environment into smaller and smaller bits, but it mostly does not break down, it does not bio-degrade. Without major logistical efforts backed by tight environmental standards it has accumulated in the environment in larger quantities and in smaller and smaller pieces. According to <A href=""http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111913"">one recent estimate</A> there are more than 5 trillion plastic pieces weighing over 250,000 tons afloat at sea. </P><P><A href=""http://www.oceanconservancy.org/our-work/marine-debris/science-paper-executive.pdf"">This is not hearsay either</A>. </P><P>The amount of plastic waste entering the oceans from land each year exceeds 4.8 million tons (Mt), and the figure may be as high as 12.7 Mt . This is nearly one to three orders of magnitude greater than the reported mass of plastic in high-concentration ocean gyres which are slowly turning marine collection points for garbage the size of western europe. The amount is growing rapidly – with the potential to be 250 Mt by 2025. </P><P>Impacts by plastic debris on more than 660 species have been documented, including from entanglement and ingestion. Species impacted range from the smallest of zooplankton to the largest whales, including fish destined to the seafood market.  Plastics can concentrate toxic chemicals from seawater up to 1 million fold. Ingestion of these contaminated plastic particles may deliver these chemicals to the ocean animals which eat them, potentially resulting in negative effects on their health and survival.</P><P>The problem is not just in the oceans – <A href=""http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/environmental-audit-committee/news-parliament-2015/environmental-impact-microplastics-evidence-2-15-16/"">but also the atmosphere</A>. It was recently reported in a House of Commons Committee how, when plastics go through sewerage treatment works, much of the smaller pieces end in sludge that goes onto fields.  When it dries out it is swept up by the windinto the atmosphere. <A href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/plastic-microplastic-microbeads-<mark>pollution</mark>-toxic-environment-house-of-commons-environmental-audit-a7011256.html"">At that point we breathe it in – in addition to eating it in foodstuffs like fish.</A></P><P>This prompts the question: how do <mark>Ineos</mark> and Ratcliffe see progress? How is this ecological disaster compatible with it? He wants economic growth and more of this. When he offers the regeneration of the north of Britain if only he can get another fix of cheap energy and more ethane feedstock what he is effectively wanting is to hang onto a share of the plastic market. He wants to be a boss of a corporation that wants to remain a global player in the production of this torrent of production. But is it not also a torrent of poisonous garbage?
Of course, we cannot know what is in the mind of a man like this, or the minds of his managers and partners. We can only speculate that  he will be thinking mainly in market and money terms. “The market for plastic” is economics-think, in which a product and a value stream is what is being thought about. The focus is on how to make a product that people want and thus to be fully entitled to make money as a reward for entreprenerial zeal and risking money. In the perception of the corporate bosses all this stuff is packaging and containers and the plastic is created to be embedded in products that people are prepared to pay for – or to package these products. This is what usually gets their attention. This is what happens between their ears. This is the thing that they know about.  The products have monetary value, people are prepared to pay, and this is their business. </P><P>But how much do such captains of industry think about what happens when the stuff that they produce is thrown away?  Yes, there is clearly thought given to the topic of what money can be made out of processing garbage. We know this because of the <mark>Ineos</mark> development of waste to energy and electricity technologies. However, what about the rest of the stream of garbage?  Is this not also their problem? It is certainly a problem for everyone else, and it is a problem that will not now go away for hundreds of years. In these hundreds of years those who live long enough to learn about what happened to their world will know may become aware of the name of Mr Ratcliffe as one of the people who organised the huge stream of plastic. One of the business moguls  whose products led to the eco-cide of the oceans.</P><H2>Championing the ‘Green Economy’ – to head off the real solutions that would make your company lose</H2><P>A lot of people don’t notice – but when corporations respond to environmental problems with which they are associated they often fund or support “solutions” which direct the action for dealing with it away from themselves. Someone else become the people or institutions that are responsible and these others have to deal with it. “Beyond Petroleum”, BP, gives another example of this. When it was clear that something was going to have to be done about <mark>climate change</mark> and <mark>carbon</mark> emissions then companies like BP  under Lord Browne moved to co-opt the policy design process. For a long time, the major fossil fuel suppliers had resisted any restraint on emissions but, at the end of the 1990s, some of them changed tack. </P><P>BP first experimented with an internal emissions trading scheme which was started in 1999. In 2002, the BP model was scaled up with the support of the UK government’s Department of the Environment and 34 other voluntarily participating companies. This UK scheme, in turn, became a model for the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme.  So far so predictable. But what was the defining characteristic of the BP scheme? If it had been a serious attempt to throttle back the supply and burning of fossil fuels it would have attempted to keep the <mark>carbon</mark> in the ground. It would have been directed at the suppliers themselves. Instead the scheme was designed around the demand. It was focused on uses and users of fossil fuels and those who bought them. It very successfully batted the solutions away from the fossil companies who were originating the problem. When the European Emissions Trading Scheme was introduced it was large companies that bought and used fossil fuels and emitted <mark>CO2</mark> during their operations, that were expected to buy permits. It was not the companies producing the coal, oil and gas who were expected to buy permits to sell fossil fuels in the first place. If it had been the latter it could have covered all fossil fuel based emissions. But that was something that neither BP nor the other suppliers wanted to see.  They designed the scheme and wrecked it. </P><P>Now <mark>Ineos</mark> Bio is seeking to find a market by reusing plastics and waste. But the <mark>Ineos</mark> group is not seeking to restrain its production in the first place. From a profit making point of view an ideal solution is to produce a stream of trash and then make money by the need to deal with part of that same trash stream. Of course, if <mark>Ineos</mark> were promoting a system where no new plastics were allowed to be produced but only existing plastics could be re-used to make them then it would be commendable. But that’s not what they are proposing and recycling alone, without further measures to throttle the flow, at source  will not adequately cope with the <mark>pollution</mark> stream. Like all corporate juggernauts <mark>Ineos</mark> wants to “grow” its markets and its production. That’s why the solution to plastic <mark>pollution</mark> may indeed involve some recyling and re-use but it has to be set in the context of reducing production. As <A href=""http://upstreampolicy.org/the-solution-to-plastic-<mark>pollution</mark>/"">one policy group have argued</A>: </P><P><EM>“The reality is that the only sound strategies to stop plastic <mark>pollution</mark> are ones that prevent it in the first place. To use the bathtub analogy, in order to stop the tub from over-flowing, we can either try to make the tub drain faster, or we can just shut off the tap.”</EM></P><P>That means a raft of policies – and a good place to start is to fight the further development of shale gas in the UK in order to stop it being used as feedstock for plastics and as a fuel source.</P><H2>In conclusion – the myth of cheap energy and revived industrialism </H2><P>Let’s return to the story that Jim Ratcliffe would like to believe and wants us to believe. This is that cheap energy will return northern Britain to its industrial heritage. It will resurrect former mining communities and other industries too. It will help us develop the new industries of the future based on science – like plastics.</P><P>To many people this will seem a curiously antiquated view of the scientific and industrial future – it only rings true if you stubbornly refuse to look at a lot of evidence that the world has long ago evolved in another direction.  Is Ratcliffe still thinking like an ambitious 1960s Grammar School boy who has just completed his science A levels? Does he still believe in “the white heat of the technological revolution”, which is how Harold Wilson, the Labour Prime Minister of the 1960s and early 1970s hyped the times he lived in?
Unfortunately there is now a mountain of evidence that fracking is deeply destructive to health and the environment. Ratcliffe wants to see that as “hearsay”. </P><P>There is also a mountain of evidence that says that the products of his company and of the petro-chemical industry in general, products like plastics, are a profound threat and must be dramatically reduced at source. Ratcliffe sees this situation when there’s a business opportunity in it for him – by selling the ability to recycling some of the tide of trash as a recycled energy source.  But is he aware that much more is needed to cope with it?</P><P>There is now too a mountain of evidence that the trend to rising extraction costs for fossil fuels is inevitable. Fracking is a more expensive way of extracting oil and gas than from conventional wells because you have to do a lot more engineering activity to release it from an impervious geological strata. It is true that there is currently a very low oil and gas price because a debt laden economy, an economy still dominated by ageing baby boomers, cannot afford to pay for expensive oil and gas or for the products made from this expensively produced oil and gas. This contradiction is creating yawning holes in the profit and loss accounts and balance sheets of the oil and gas companies, as well as in the accounts of the financiers that have lent to them. Yet Ratcliffe, like the political elite schooled at Eton and Oxford, appears to be unable to see the writing on the wall. </P><P>At the core of the Ratcliffe message is the idea of fracking giving us cheap energy. But fracking does not give cheap energy. It is not cheap to the people whose health it damages. It is not financially cheap either.  That’s why Ratcliffe is selling what appears to be a fantasy. Sure, unconventional gas extracted in the UK would not carry the same size of burden of having to pay for the military and security expenses, as well as the lavish corruption, of a variety of oil despotisms – the places where some conventional sources of oil and gas are extracted. But the extraction costs of fracked unconventional wells are higher than extraction costs for conventional wells. That’s why, to break even, unconventionally sourced gas has to be sold at a higher price too. For the <mark>Ineos</mark> gamble to pay off it is necessary that shale in the UK would be as cheap as in the very best Pennsylvania sweet spots. There is no guarantee for this and it is likely to be wishful thinking.</P><P>There is, in fact, a Catch 22 in the heart of the <mark>Ineos</mark> regeneration fairy tale. The economic system has been built on cheap energy but it is now faced with ever rising costs of energy extraction which require higher prices for the energy companies to break even. In order to pay their rising energy bills people and companies have to economise somewhere else. They struggle to service their debts too. Rising energy prices crash the economy. They destabilise the finance sector.  This puts a ceiling on how high energy prices can be and the break even point for the oil and gas companies is above that ceiling. </P><P>Fracking has not solved this dilemma and neither will Ratcliffe or <mark>Ineos</mark>. There is virtually nowhere in the world where fracking has ever made a profit over the longer term. If it comes off at all the cheap energy that Ratcliffe champions would lead, in a just a few years, to an indebted and then bankrupt exploration and production sector.  The fracking road show has kept going in the USA for as long as it has only because central banks have kept interest rates down to virtually zero. There have been few other opportunities to invest in the production economy and, as the financial papers describe it, those who “hunt for yield” have gambled their money by investing in shale.  Now that mountain of debt accumulated by the fracking industry can no longer be serviced and repaid, Ponzi-style, with more borrowing. It’s the end of the road.</P><P>This is a Catch 22 Ratcliffe and the other petrochemical companies will not be able to solve. The cheap energy and re-industrialisation idea that Ratcliffe is promoting is a mirage, a fantasy, that would lead to a mountain of debt and a mountain of garbage.  It will inevitably collapse. We can already see the signs of a global deflationary crisis as a result of crippling debts and sagging markets. The direction of the future is solving the problem of how to make do with less. Instead of growing the economy will have to mature – or it will collapse. You do people a favour not by producing more of anything, and certainly not more plastic wastes to poison the environment – but by setting up institutions to help them save energy, materials and money. Such institutions will help people to share more, make do, mend and get their satisfactions and pleasures without the aid of ecocidal empires built on trash. </P><H2>Endnotes</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,2.0,Strongly Negative

The BMW Group and <mark>Daimler AG</mark> have <A href=""http://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/BMW-Group-and-Daimler-AG-agree-to-combine-mobility-services.xhtml?oid=34636751&amp;ls=L2VuL2luc3RhbmNlL2tvLnhodG1sP29pZD00ODM2MjU4JnJlbElkPTYwODI5JmZyb21PaWQ9NDgzNjI1OCZib3JkZXJzPXRydWUmcmVzdWx0SW5mb1R5cGVJZD00MDYyNiZ2aWV3VHlwZT10aHVtYnM!&amp;rs=0"">signed</A> an agreement to merge their mobility services business units. Subject to examination and approval by the responsible competition authorities, the BMW Group and <mark>Daimler AG</mark> plan to combine and strategically expand their existing on-demand mobility offering in the areas of CarSharing, Ride-Hailing, Parking, Charging and Multimodality. 
</P><P>
Each company will hold a 50% stake in a joint-venture model comprising both companies’ mobility services. The two companies will remain competitors in their respective core businesses.
</P><P>
The aim of this transaction is to become a leading provider of innovative mobility services. Both automotive manufacturers aim to shape the mobility of the future to be able to offer their customers unique experiences and support their partners, such as cities and communes, in achieving <mark>sustainable</mark> urban mobility.
</P><P>
The partners intend to offer their customers a holistic ecosystem of intelligent, seamlessly connected mobility services, available at the tap of a finger. Together, the BMW Group and <mark>Daimler AG</mark> plan to grow this new business model sustainably and enable rapid global scaling of services.
</P><P>
Working as partners, both companies are thereby addressing the challenges arising from urban mobility and changing customer wishes, and cooperating with cities, municipalities and other interest groups to improve quality of life in major cities. The merger will promote electromobility, for example, by offering electrified CarSharing vehicles, as well as easy access to charging and parking options. As a result, it will become even easier to experience and use <mark>sustainable</mark> mobility services.
</P><P>
The equally-owned joint venture model is designed to combine services in the following five areas:
</P><OL><LI><P><B>Multimodal and on-demand mobility with moovel and ReachNow:</B>
Intelligent and seamless connectivity between different mobility offerings—including booking and payment—will create significant added value for users. It will also offer possible solutions for the challenges of urban private transport.</P></LI><LI><P><B>CarSharing with Car2Go and DriveNow:</B>
Car2Go and DriveNow operate a total of 20,000 vehicles in 31 major international cities. CarSharing enables better utilization of vehicles and thus helps reduce the total number of vehicles in cities. More than four million customers already use these CarSharing services.</P></LI><LI><P><B>Ride-Hailing with mytaxi, Chauffeur Privé, Clever Taxi and Beat:</B>
With Europe’s largest taxi app, simply order a taxi or use a licensed driver in France for a ride in the French metropolises. In total, 13 million customers and some 140,000 drivers are already using the modern, practical and fast way of Ride-Hailing with mytaxi, Clever Taxi and Beat or private hire vehicle service Chauffeur Privé. Innovative offers such as mytaximatch, in which people not known to each other share a taxi at a fingertip, make an important contribution to reducing inner-city traffic by eliminating numerous individual trips in the urban space.</P></LI><LI><P><B>Parking with ParkNow and Parkmobile Group/Parkmobile LLC:</B>
Ticketless, cashless on-street parking or help finding, reserving and paying for off-street parking in a garage. Innovative digital parking services reduce the time and the amount of driving involved in finding a parking space. This will reduce traffic significantly, as cars searching for parking spaces currently account for around 30% of road traffic.</P></LI><LI><P><B>Charging with ChargeNow and Digital Charging Solutions:</B>
Easy access (incl. location, charging and payment) to the world’s largest network of public charging stations with more than 143,000 charging points worldwide. Combined with parking privileges in cities, this will support the expansion of electromobility, by helping people get to know this drive technology and integrate it easily into their mobility needs.</P></LI></OL><P>
The formation of the joint venture will produce a significant valuation and earnings effect at Daimler Financial Services. If the approval of the competition authorities is received this year, following adjustments will be made to the group outlook for <mark>Daimler AG</mark>: The company expects EBIT for Daimler Financial Services to be significantly higher than the previous year; for the Group as a whole, this means EBIT is likely to be slightly higher than the previous year.
</P><P>
If approved by the relevant authorities in the course of this year, the formation of the joint venture will trigger a one-time valuation and earnings effect in the BMW AG’s group financial statement and thus lead to an adjustment of the company’s guidance: Under these circumstances, pre-tax earnings on Group level would increase slightly in 2018 compared with the previous year. The valuation and earnings effect would have no impact on the EBIT margin in the automotive segment.
</P><P>
The joint project is subject to examination and approval by the respective competition authorities. The best-possible customer experience is already the focus of both partners’ services. Therefore, initially nothing will change for the millions of customers, with existing services still being provided to the same extent and with the same level of quality.

This new research centre employs 300 scientists to conduct research on lightweight materials and battery cells for the development of hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric vehicles, such as the new ENV 2.0.</P>Image credit: General Motors<P>The example of General Motors illustrates the recent trend toward increasing globalization of R&amp;D. In the last decades, multinational corporations (MNCs) are increasingly conducting R&amp;D – and at the same time green R&amp;D - outside their home countries. Such globalization of R&amp;D by MNCs firms might actually be good news for the international diffusion of green technologies. After all, multinationals are large innovating firms - in 2005, the 700 largest multinationals accounted for more than 70% of world private R&amp;D expenditures (UNCTAD, 2005) – which play a key role in technology transfers to emerging and developing countries. By having face-to-face interactions with the scientists from General Motors located in Shanghai, many local Chinese suppliers and manufacturers will increase their knowledge about hybrid and electric vehicles technologies.</P><P>In a <A href=""http://www.greengrowthknowledge.org/resource/multinational-firms-and-internationalization-green-rd-review-evidence-and-policy"">recent paper</A>, we provide new empirical evidence on the geographic location of green R&amp;D for a sample of 1,200 MNCs.  Using information on inventors’ addresses as stated in firms’ green patents applications, we find that about 17% of our sample of patents have been developed by inventors overseas. China attracts the largest number of foreign green R&amp;D patents, in particular in the field of energy-efficient lightings, solar and wind technologies. Not only General Motors but also  Philips and Vestas, respectively leaders in lightings and wind technologies, have nowadays R&amp;D laboratories located in China. For the rest, most of the top-20 destination of foreign green R&amp;D activities by MNCs are composed of OECD countries (see Figure 1), with India and Taiwan entering in the last positions.</P><P style=""text-align: center;""> </P><P>So why are MNCs conducting green R&amp;D abroad? And if attracting MNCs green R&amp;D is important for technology transfers and green growth, what can policymakers do about it? <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/29/us-autos-china-gm-idUSBRE8AS09920121129"">In the press</A>, Kevin Wale, Director of General Motors stated that the new Chinese technical center “will ensure that GM keeps up with the needs of our local customers through the development of cutting-edge automotive technology that is cleaner, more efficient and affordable.” John Du, Director of the technical center, motivated further the decision to open this new R&amp;D lab in China by the abundant supply of scientists and engineers in China (&quot;China now ranks first in the world in the number of PhD candidates, and these are talents we want to attract into the GM R&amp;D and engineering workforce”), the proximity to Asian companies in Korea and Japan leading the world in electric car battery research, China’s resources of magnesium used for batteries and light-weight steel, and the presence of a large number of producers of automobile parts in China.</P><P>The international business literature generally identifies two main motives for MNCs to conduct green R&amp;D abroad: 1) technology-sourcing (to source local knowledge which is not available at home) and 2) adaptive R&amp;D (i.e. the need to adapt products to specific markets to support local sales). Conducting an empirical investigation on the determinants of MNCs to offshore green R&amp;D, our results give indeed support to both motives. On one hand, we find that MNCs are attracted by a good supply of scientists and engineers, stringent IPRs and strong technological capabilities in the host country. These results emphasize the role of technology policy in enhancing the local R&amp;D infrastructure. Costs of R&amp;D also matters as we find MNCs R&amp;D investments are attracted by lower wages for R&amp;D workers. On the other hand, we find that countries where MNCs can expect higher sales - due in particular to a larger market size or a higher cultural or geographic proximity – also tend to attract MNCs R&amp;D activities. Most importantly, our results show the pivotal role of local environmental policy in attracting foreign green R&amp;D investments - both to develop specific local technological capacities and to create a market for green products. Since Beijing wants 500,000 electrics and hybrids on the road by 2015 and five million by 2020, General Motors is at the right place to develop the next generation of vehicle battery systems.</P><DIV><DIV id=""ftn2""> </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1.0,2.0,Positive

Opening remarks by Moussa Oumarou, Acting Deputy Director-General for Policy of the ILO, reminded of how the ILO was strongly involved in the negotiation process leading up to - and at - the <A href=""/global/topics/green-jobs/news/cop21/lang--en/index.htm"" target="""">COP21</A> with various platforms for discussion organized and consultations with constituents undertaken on how to advance the <mark>climate change</mark> and decent work agendas in a mutually supportive manner. Moussa Oumarou stressed that <mark>climate change</mark> is already having significant impacts on the world of work. For instance, rain-fed agriculture, which accounts for 90% of agricultural production in Africa, risks to drop by 50 % and about 25 million displaced peopled are recorded annually since 2008 due to natural disasters. He emphasised how the transition to low-<mark>carbon</mark> economies offers great potential for job creation, such as the renewable energy section which employs around 8 million people, and improved job quality. However, this transition process will have to be socially just and inclusive as jobs with few options for <mark>sustainable</mark> production methods will be at risk of loss.H.E. Ambassador Elisabeth Laurin of France recalled that the<A href=""http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php"" target=""""> Paris Agreement</A> adopted by 195 countries in December 2015 is a differentiated and ambitious one to achieve the objective of limiting global average temperature rise to 2 °C and move towards 1.5 °C.The signing by countries of the Agreement will create national legal obligations for measurable and concrete action to stop greenhouse gas emissions and will enter into force 30 days after at least 55 countries, accounting for 55 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, have deposited their instruments for ratification. An important element of the Paris Agreement is the recognition of “the imperative of a just transition of the workforce and the creation of decent work and quality jobs in accordance with nationally defined development priorities”.Looking towards the <A href=""http://marrakech-cop22.com/"" target="""">COP22</A> in Marrakesh, Khalid Atlassi of Morocco, highlighted how issues remain around funding and the verification of the implementation of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) through a transparent and effective process. H.E. Ambassador Sammie Eddico of Ghana mentioned that NDC will be an important vehicle towards poverty reduction and achieving social inclusion. He noted that Ghana’s national employment policy adopted in 2014 includes reference to green jobs and is one of the <A href=""http://www.un-page.org/"" target="""">PAGE</A> countries. Dongwen Duan of China indicated that the 13th Five-Year Plan is addressing <mark>climate change</mark>. The government by 2020 aims to reduce <mark>carbon</mark> intensity and energy intensity by unit of GDP, 18% and 15% respectively, and create 25 million green jobs. He affirmed that 1.3 million workers will have to be relocated due to the transition to a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy, notably by the closing of 4,300 coal mines and highlighted the importance of vocational training and skills development. Vic Van Vuuren, Director of ILO <A href=""/empent/lang--en/index.htm"" target="""">Enterprises Department</A>, said that enterprises are already playing a major role in investing in new technologies and in tapping into new markets for green goods and services as they realise that it makes business sense. He underlined how SMEs are key given that they account for two-thirds of all jobs worldwide. Yet, large enterprises and the greening of value chains are essential in the transition process. This year the International Labour Conference in June will have dedicated discussion on<A href=""/ilc/ILCSessions/105/reports/reports-to-the-conference/WCMS_468097/lang--en/index.htm"" target=""""> global supply chains</A>. Anabella Rosemberg of the <A href=""http://www.ituc-csi.org/"" target="""">ITUC</A> called for strong policy coherence and indicated how just transitions will need to be planned at national and regional level and reminded of the importance of social dialogue.Senior ILO specialists, Valérie Schmitt and Mito Tsukamoto, indicated how social protection schemes and public employment programmes can be useful mechanisms in <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation and adaptation efforts and how green works can offer green jobs opportunities locally through infrastructure and related employment-intensive approaches.Kees van der Ree, Coordinator of the <A href=""/global/topics/green-jobs/WCMS_213842/lang--en/index.htm"" target="""">ILO Green Jobs Programme</A>, mentioned that the ILO has launched the Green Centenary Initiative  to significantly scale up the ILO’s office-wide knowledge, policy advice and tools for managing a just transition to a low <mark>carbon</mark>, <mark>sustainable</mark> future. The objective of the Green Initiative is to better equip the actors of the world of work to understand the challenges and opportunities of the coming transition, and help them take up the active role they must play in managing this change.In the following discussions, comments and questions were raised with respect to the role of transfer of technology, the importance of the issue of heat in the workplace, the implications of <mark>climate change</mark> for the future of work initiative at the ILO, and how the ILO should keep its engagement within the relevant bodies of the <A href=""http://unfccc.int/2860.php"" target="""">UN Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark></A> with a focus on supporting implementation. In closing, Moustapha Kamal Gueye from the ILO Green Jobs Programme, serving as facilitator, noted that the dialogue provided an opportunity for Geneva-based Permanent Missions to the United Nations and other organizations to express their needs and priorities from the perspective of countries, and for the ILO officials to provide an overview of what the ILO can offer in terms of tools, intervention models, successful practices and experiences to contribute both to <mark>climate</mark> action and the promotion of decent work and a just transition for all. </DIV></DIV><ASIDE class=""meta-data""><P><STRONG>Tags: </STRONG>labour intensive employment, green jobs, employment policy, social protection, infrastructure, <mark>climate change</mark></P><P><STRONG>Regions and countries covered: </STRONG>

Currently, the BWM Convention has been ratified by 61 countries, representing 68.46% of world merchant shipping tonnage.</P><P>From the date of entry into force, ships will be required to manage their ballast water to avoid the transfer of potentially invasive species.  All ships will be required to have a ballast water management plan and keep a ballast water record book. Ships will be required to manage their ballast water to meet the so-called D-1 standard or D-2 standard.</P><P>The D-1 standard requires ships to conduct the exchange of ballast water such that at least 95% of water by volume is exchanged far away from the coast where it would be released. </P><P>The <A href=""#Section"">D-2 standard*</A> requires ballast water management to restrict to a specified maximum the amount of viable organisms allowed to be discharged and to limit the discharge of specified indicator microbes harmful to human health.</P><P>Draft amendments to the treaty approved by the MEPC clarify when ships must comply with the requirement to meet the D-2 standard.</P><P>The draft amendments will be circulated after the entry into force of the BWM Convention on 8 September 2017, with a view to adoption at the next MEPC session (MEPC 72 in April 2018).  Under the approved amendments, new ships, i.e., ships constructed on or after 8 September 2017, shall conduct ballast water management that at least meets the D-2 standard from the date they are put into service. For existing ships, i.e., ships constructed before 8 September 2017, the date for compliance with the D-2 standard is linked with the renewal survey of the ship associated with the International Oil <mark>Pollution</mark> Prevention Certificate under MARPOL Annex I. For existing ships this would be the first or second five-year renewal survey after 8 September 2017:</P><UL><LI>By the first renewal survey: this applies when that the first renewal survey of the ship takes place on or after 8 September 2019 or a renewal survey has been completed on or after 8 September 2014 but prior to 8 September 2017. </LI><LI>By the second renewal survey: this applies if the first renewal survey after 8 September 2017 takes place before 8 September 2019. In this case, compliance must be by the second renewal survey (provided that the previous renewal survey has not been completed in the period between 8 September 2014 and 8 September 2017). </LI></UL><P>An existing ship to which the IOPP renewal survey under MARPOL Annex I does not apply shall meet the D-2 standard from the date decided by the Administration, but not later than 8 September 2024.</P><P>The MEPC adopted a resolution which resolves that Parties to the BWM Convention should implement the schedule for compliance outlined in the draft amendments, ahead of their adoption and entry into force.   </P><P>In other work focusing on implementation of the BWM treaty, the MEPC, inter alia:</P><UL><LI>adopted the 2017 Guidelines for ballast water exchange (G6);</LI><LI>adopted the 2017 Guidelines for risk assessment under regulation A-4 of the BWM Convention (G7);</LI><LI>adopted an MEPC resolution on “The experience-building phase associated with the BWM Convention”;</LI><LI>approved the Code for approval of ballast water management systems, and approved draft amendments to the BWM Convention to make the Code mandatory, for adoption at the next session;</LI><LI>approved amendments to section E (Survey and certification) of the BWM Convention, also for adoption at MEPC 72;</LI><LI>approved a manual on &quot;Ballast Water Management - How to do it&quot;;</LI><LI>approved Guidance on contingency measures under the BWM Convention;</LI><LI>approved a circular on Application of the BWM Convention to ships operating in sea areas where ballast water exchange in accordance with regulations B-4.1 and D-1 is not possible;</LI><LI>granted final approval to one and basic approval to two ballast water management systems that makes use of active substances.

In other work related to the implementation of the mandatory energy efficiency measures in MARPOL Annex VI, the MEPC:</P><UL><LI>adopted 2017 Guidelines for Administration verification of ship fuel oil consumption data, to support the implementation of the mandatory MARPOL requirements for ships of 5,000 gross tonnage and above to collect consumption data for each type of fuel oil they use, as well as additional specified data, including proxies for transport work, from calendar year 2019;</LI><LI>adopted 2017 Guidelines for the development and management of the IMO Ship Fuel Oil Consumption Database;</LI><LI>approved an MEPC circular on Submission of data to the IMO data collection system for fuel oil consumption of ships from a State not Party to MARPOL Annex VI;</LI><LI>approved draft amendments to regulation 21 of MARPOL Annex VI regarding EEDI requirements for ro-ro cargo and ro-ro passenger ships, with a view to adoption at MEPC 72;</LI><LI>established a correspondence group on review of the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) beyond phase 2, to report on progress by MEPC 72 and make a recommendation to MEPC 73 on the time period and reduction rates for EEDI phase 3 requirements. </LI></UL><P><STRONG>Protecting the Arctic from heavy fuel oil – work to begin at MEPC 72</STRONG>The MEPC agreed to add a new output in its work programme on the development of measures to reduce risks of use and carriage of heavy fuel oil (HFO) as fuel by ships in Arctic waters. This new output will appear on the agenda for its next session (MEPC 72) in April 2018.</P><P>Member Governments and international organizations were invited to submit concrete proposals on what type of measures should be developed, including the scope of the work, to MEPC 72, so that clear instructions can be given to the PPR Sub-Committee which will carry out the detailed technical work, starting at PPR 6.</P><P>The use and carriage of heavy fuel oil is banned in Antarctic waters under MARPOL and the IMO Polar Code recommends that States follow the same practice in the Arctic.  <STRONG>Designation of Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park (Philippines) as a PSSA </STRONG>The MEPC approved the final designation of the Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park, situated in the Sulu Sea, Philippines as a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA), following the adoption by the Maritime Safety Committee of a new Area to be avoided as an associated protective measure. The aim is to reduce the risk of ship groundings in the park, thereby preventing any resulting marine <mark>pollution</mark> and damage to the fragile coral reef ecosystem, as well as ensuring the sustainability of local artisanal fisheries.</P><P>This brings the number of marine areas protected in this way to 15 (plus two extensions).</P><P><STRONG>OSV Chemical Code</STRONG>The MEPC approved the draft Code for the transport and handling of hazardous and noxious liquid substances in bulk on offshore support vessels (OSV Chemical Code), prepared by PPR 4 and amended and approved by MSC 98, for submission to the thirtieth IMO Assembly for adoption later this year.</P><P><STRONG>Oil <mark>pollution</mark> model courses approved</STRONG>Updated IMO Model Courses on Oil <mark>Pollution</mark> Preparedness, Response and Cooperation (OPRC Model Training Courses) were approved by the MEPC. The OPRC model training courses have been revised to provide up-to-date guidance for preparedness and response to marine oil spills.</P><P><STRONG>Major technical cooperation projects</STRONG>The MEPC was informed about recent developments with regard to major environment-related technical cooperation (TC) projects. With a view to continuing the technical cooperation efforts in marine biosafety, which started with the GloBallast Partnerships Project which came to an end in June 2017, IMO has secured further funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to prepare a full-scale document for a new global project aimed at assisting with implementation of the IMO Guidelines for controlling and managing ships’ biofouling.  </P><P>On the sidelines of the MEPC meeting,  leading shipowners and operators, classification societies, engine and technology builders and suppliers, big data providers, and oil companies signed up to a new Global Industry Alliance (GIA) to support shipping and its related industries make the transition towards a low <mark>carbon</mark> future.  The GIA has been established under the auspices of the GloMEEP Project, a GEF-United Nations Development Program (UNDP)-IMO project to support developing countries implement energy-efficiency measures for shipping.</P><P>Meanwhile, the European Union-funded Global MTCC Network (GMN) Project has successfully established maritime technology cooperation centres (MTTCs) in its five target regions - Asia, Africa, Caribbean, Latin America and Pacific. With the goal to support the move towards low-<mark>carbon</mark> shipping, the MTTCs will focus on capacity-building efforts and implementing pilot projects involving fuel oil consumption data collection and developing low-<mark>carbon</mark> technologies.</P><P>___________</P><P>* <STRONG class=""ms-rteThemeForeColor-6-0""><EM><A name=""Section"" id=""Section"" href=""/en/MediaCentre/PressBriefings/Pages/17-MEPC-71.aspx"">Regulation D-2 Ballast Water Performance Standard</A></EM></STRONG></P><OL><LI>Ships conducting Ballast Water Management in accordance with this regulation shall discharge less than 10 viable organisms per cubic metre greater than or equal to 50 micrometres in minimum dimension and less than 10 viable organisms per millilitre less than 50 micrometres in minimum dimension and greater than or equal to 10 micrometres in minimum dimension; and discharge of the indicator microbes shall not exceed the specified concentrations described in paragraph 2.</LI><LI> Indicator microbes, as a human health standard, shall include:.1 Toxicogenic Vibrio cholerae (O1 and O139) with less than 1 colony forming unit (cfu) per 100 millilitres or less than 1 cfu per 1 gram (wet weight) zooplankton samples ;.2 Escherichia coli less than 250 cfu per 100 millilitres;.3 Intestinal Enterococci less than 100 cfu per 100 milliliters.</LI></OL><DIV><A href=""#Top"">Back to top</A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV> </DIV><P><STRONG>IMO</STRONG>– the International Maritime Organization – is the United Nations specialized agency with responsibility for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine <mark>pollution</mark> by ships.</P></DIV></DIV></FORM></BODY></HTML>",2.0,0.0,

“proportionate to all parties – including yourselves (<mark>Ineos</mark>)”.</P><P>It said the threat of a terrorist attack on energy installations at the time was deemed “possible but not

						Byron Wilson | December 1, 2015					</SPAN></DIV><P>This week, 150 Heads of State and Government have convened in Paris, France, at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark>. The goal of the Conference is to “reach a new universal <mark>climate</mark> agreement that is applicable to all,” according to the <A href=""http://www.COP21.gouv.fr"" target=""_blank"">COP21.gouv.fr </A>website. The hope is that some arrangement can be reached to help reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions worldwide and keep global warming from exceeding a two degree Celsius rise in the coming years.</P><P>Emissions legislation and the transition to cleaner energy, both of which are included as strategies toward curbing <mark>climate change</mark>, have obvious impacts on the motorcycle industry. Europe, for example, has set some of the most stringent emissions standards on motorcycles with further restrictions forthcoming. Further changes are likely to be seen in the US as well, in part because of the pledges two motorcycle companies have made in accord with strategies outlined by the White House in Paris. American Honda Motor Company and the <mark>BMW</mark> Group are now involved in efforts to address global warming, both companies signing the American Business Act on <mark>Climate</mark> Pledge.</P><P>In a press release <A href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/11/30/white-house-announces-additional-commitments-american-business-act"" target=""_blank"">issued November 30, 2015</A>, by the White House, 154 companies are cited as having signed the pledge, each offering company-specific strategies to combat <mark>climate change</mark>. American Honda and <mark>BMW</mark> are currently the only two motorcycle OEMs to sign the pledge.</P><P>Here’s the text of the Pledge, in its entirety, courtesy of the White House:</P><P><EM>We applaud the growing number of countries that have already set ambitious targets for <mark>climate</mark> action. In this context, we support the conclusion of a <mark>climate change</mark> agreement in Paris that takes a strong step forward toward a low-<mark>carbon</mark>, <mark>sustainable</mark> future.</EM></P><P><EM>We recognize that delaying action on <mark>climate change</mark> will be costly in economic and human terms, while accelerating the transition to a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy will produce multiple benefits with regard to <mark>sustainable</mark> economic growth, public health, resilience to natural disasters, and the health of the global environment.</EM></P><P>Honda has made a commitment to “reducing its total company <mark>CO2</mark> emissions by 50 percent by the year 2050, when compared to its 2000 baseline,” as well as to “reduce the <mark>CO2</mark> intensity of its automobiles, motorcycles and power equipment products worldwide by 30 percent by the year 2020, as compared to its 2000 baseline.”</P><P>“Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases remain at the center of our vision for helping to address society’s energy and environmental concerns,” said Honda North America President and CEO Takuji Yamada in a company press release. “Our efforts toward reducing GHG emissions and other environmental impacts extend to every facet of our operations.”</P><P>Part of Honda’s strategy to reach these numbers includes increasing its use of renewable energies, “establishing zero-waste-to-landfill facilities and reducing energy usage throughout its operations.”</P><P><mark>BMW</mark> is similarly motivated. Harald Krueger, Chairman of the Board of Management of <mark>BMW</mark> AG, provided this statement in a company press release:</P><P>“Sustainability plays a central role for the <mark>BMW</mark> Group. We have set up long-term sustainability goals which have defined targets to 2020 and thereafter. Therefore, we are pleased to join the American Business Act on <mark>Climate</mark> Pledge.”</P><P>“The American Business Act on <mark>Climate</mark> Pledge demonstrates our company’s public commitment to fight <mark>climate change</mark> by taking action,” added Ludwig Willisch, President and CEO, <mark>BMW</mark> of North America. “With this commitment, the <mark>BMW</mark> Group further shows its intent to continue being a leader in sustainability across the entire value chain: from R&amp;D to manufacturing to operations.”</P><P><mark>BMW</mark>’s goals include becoming the “leading automobile manufacturer in the use of renewable energy” by 2020 and continuing its investment in public/private partnerships aimed at “mass market adoption of zero-emissions vehicles.”</P><P>Strategies will be implemented at <mark>BMW</mark>’s California, South Carolina, Washington State and New Jersey locations and global initiatives will see the company reduce energy and water consumption in addition to reducing Volatile Organic Compound emissions from its vehicles.</P><P>EV technology has been slowly creeping into the mainstream motorcycle market over the past few years, highlighted by <A href=""http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/2014/06/article/harley-davidson-livewire-first-ride/"" target=""_blank"">Harley-Davidson’s Livewire</A> concept and <A href=""http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/2015/01/article/polaris-acquires-brammo-motorcycles/"" target=""_blank"">Polaris’ acquisition of Brammo</A> assets. Zero Motorcycles continues to lead the charge by improving the range and performance of its power sources, <mark>BMW</mark> put its C evolution electric scooter <A href=""http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/2013/09/article/<mark>bmw</mark>-confirms-production-e-scooter-for-2014/"" target=""_blank"">into production in 2014</A> and Yamaha has released a <A href=""http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/2015/10/article/yamaha-to-reveal-tilting-3-wheeler-electric-motorcycles-125cc-cafe-cruiser-at-tokyo-motor-show/"" target=""_blank"">number of electric concepts</A>. Pledges and promises are one thing, but actual resource allocation from major manufacturers will have a notable impact on the furthering of EV technology for motorcycles. An arms race to develop a smaller battery that provides better range, larger scale production to help reduce the final cost to consumers, investment in more charging stations and faster charging technology are all challenges to this shift to EV in the motorcycle industry. While the quiet hum of an electric motor will never replace the snarl of petrol-powered pistons and the sweet aroma of spent exhaust gasses, it will make for a very interesting and, hopefully, exciting industry in the years ahead. That’s our hope at least.</P></DIV><DIV class=""row author-box""><DIV class=""large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns""><DIV id=""author-box""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns author-avatar""><P class=""name"">Byron Wilson</P><P><B>Associate Editor</B> | <A href=""http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/author/byron-wilson/"">Articles</A> | Byron’s sure to be hunched over a laptop after the checkers are flown, caught in his own little version of heaven.

These will start in the Yorkshire Wolds (south of Malton) and then be followed by the southern edge of the North York Moors Local Plan. Details will be published in the local Press nearer the time and we will aim to publish them on this webpage.</P><P>The NPA welcomes the Government’s intention to prohibit any surface development required for hydraulic fracturing within National Parks as this increases the protection afforded to these special areas (DECC Consultation 4 Nov 2015). However, the Regulations voted on today (16 December 2015) which allow fracking to occur below 1200m from drilling outside the boundary of a National Park undermine this intention and indeed the legislation protecting these areas, which do not stop at a certain depth below the surface.</P><P>The Authority understands the Government’s wish to proceed with the shale gas industry as a transitional approach to help to move towards a lower <mark>carbon</mark> energy strategy whilst also demonstrating to the public that the country’s most sensitive environments would be protected from the risks associated with fracking. However, the fact that fracking itself will still be able to take place in the geology of the National Park means that public concerns surrounding potential groundwater contamination, seismic activity and faulting and the use of chemicals and release of naturally occurring radiative material do not appear to be addressed.</P><P>In cases where there may be future proposals for lateral fracking to extract shale gas beneath the North York Moors, the Authority would assess such a planning application against the government policy known as the ‘Major Development Test’. This does not allow such development in National Parks unless there are exceptional circumstances which must demonstrate that there is a national need for the development and that it can’t take place outside the designated area. As the Minerals Planning Authority the NPA therefore has strong planning powers to assess whether to allow future proposals for lateral fracking.</P><P>Jim Bailey, Chair of National Parks England said: </P><P>“Today’s decision to protect National Parks from surface works is welcome; and we think it is now essential that the Government’s National Planning Policy Framework is amended to make it crystal clear that hydraulic fracturing is not allowed in National Parks.  The public want to see the highest level of protection for National Parks, and so works located close by but that might involve drilling underneath National Parks must be subject to the most rigorous testing.  These sensitive areas should be the last, not the first place that developers should prospect.”</P><P>The following information on fracking is provided in response to growing public interest on the subject in and around the National Park. The North York Moors National Park Authority is the minerals planning authority for the National Park and will be responsible for determining any planning applications for fracking.</P><H3>What is fracking?</H3><P>Fracking is the common term for hydraulic fracturing, a process which involves high pressure injection of water, sand and chemicals through a borehole into deep shale rock causing this to crack and release gases (mostly methane). A vertical borehole is required to inject the sand, water and chemicals to significant depths below the surface where the fracking would take place. The gas which is extracted flows back through the borehole to the surface where it could either be used to generate electricity or be fed into gas supply networks. Waste water also returns to the surface through the borehole and this would need to be treated. Further details on the fracking process can be found <A href=""http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/268017/About_shale_gas_and_hydraulic_fracturing_Dec_2013.pdf"">here</A>.</P><DIV><H3>Is fracking currently taking place in the North York Moors National Park?</H3><P>No. To date there has not been any commercial interest in fracking within the North York Moors National Park. Conventional forms of gas exploration and production have taken place in and around the National Park over recent decades, particularly in the south west of the Park and around Westerdale.</P></DIV><DIV><H3>Is there shale gas under the North York Moors National Park?</H3><P>A report produced by <A href=""http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/226874/BGS_DECC_BowlandShaleGasReport_MAIN_REPORT.pdf"">British Geological Survey</A> suggests that the geology beneath the southern part of the North York Moors National Park may contain commercially viable shale gas resources. The British Geological Survey report suggests that shale rock which may be suitable for fracking is likely to exist between 1,500 and 4,000 metres below the surface of the National Park.</P><H3>What is the National Park Authority’s current policy on fracking?</H3><P>Whilst the Authority does not currently have any planning policies relating specifically to gas or fracking, a number of the policies contained in the <A href=""http://www.northyorkmoors.org.uk/planning/framework"">Core Strategy and Development Policies</A> would be relevant to determining applications for fracking. Within the National Park particular consideration would be given to the impacts on the Park’s special qualities and fracking applications may also be subject to consideration under the Major Development Test whereby the presumption is for refusal except in exceptional circumstances and where the development can be demonstrated to be in the public interest.</P><P>The Authority is developing policies to assess proposals for gas extraction, including fracking, as part of the Minerals and Waste Joint Plan which it is producing jointly with North Yorkshire County Council and the City of York Council. See <A href=""http://www.northyorks.gov.uk/mwjointplan"">North Yorkshire County Council's Minerals and Waste Joint Plan</A> for details. In the interim, the Authority has adopted former Government planning policy on oil and gas developments as a <A href=""http://www.northyorkmoors.org.uk/planning/planning-advice/Planning-Advice-Note-8-Oil-and-Gas.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Planning Advice Note</A>.  </P><P>The National Park Authority has recently issued a &quot;Positional Statement&quot; on fracking which you can see <A href=""http://www.northyorkmoors.org.uk/about-us/press-office/press-releases/articles2/positional-statement-on-fracking-january-2019"">here</A>.</P></DIV><DIV><H3>Why hasn’t the National Park Authority banned fracking?</H3><P>Whilst the Authority can put planning policies in place which would enable the potential impacts of any proposed fracking developments to be rigorously assessed, banning fracking is unlikely to be legally acceptable. Before planning policies can be adopted they are subject to examination by a Government appointed Planning Inspector and are unlikely to be found ‘sound’ if not in accordance with Government policy.</P></DIV><H3>What is the Government’s policy on fracking?</H3><P>The Government’s current overall stance towards fracking is set out <A href=""http://www.gov.uk/government/policy-teams/office-of-unconventional-gas-and-oil-ougo"">here</A>. National planning policy is contained in the <A href=""http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/6077/2116950.pdf"" target=""_blank"">National Planning Policy Framework</A>. Whilst this doesn’t contain specific reference to shale gas or fracking it does state that planning authorities should ‘address constraints on production and processing within areas that are licensed for oil and gas exploration or production’. Government policy in the National Planning Policy Framework relating to National Parks is equally relevant when considering any planning applications for fracking in the National Park. </P><DIV><H3>What chemicals would be used?</H3><P>The proportion of chemicals making up the water / sand / chemical mix is 0.2% at the UK’s only current fracking site in Lancashire, however the potential for effects to arise from the use of chemicals would depend upon the chemicals used and the possibility of these entering water bodies. Details of the actual chemicals approved for use at the site in Lancashire are contained in the document <A href=""http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/268017/About_shale_gas_and_hydraulic_fracturing_Dec_2013.pdf"" target=""_blank"">About Shale Gas and Hydraulic Fracturing</A>. Consent from the Environment Agency would be required prior to the use of any chemicals. </P></DIV><DIV><H3>What would happen to waste water?</H3><P>Water which has been used in the fracking process is returned to the surface and may contain minerals dissolved from the shale including naturally occurring radioactive minerals. This water, known as flow-back fluid, would require treatment which could be undertaken by either having a treatment plant on site, transportation to an off-site treatment plant or by disposal to the foul sewer. Treatment at an off-site plant may involve transportation by lorry or by pipe, the effects of which would need to be assessed as part of any planning application.</P></DIV><DIV><H3>What surface development is required?</H3><P>Visible structures at the surface of the site in Lancashire where fracking is currently taking place include a drilling rig (around 30m high), an area of hardstanding and numerous pieces of ancillary equipment, as shown on the photographs on the operator’s <A href=""http://www.cuadrillaresources.com"">website</A>. The surface development requirements may, however, vary from site to site and the planning authority is able to impose conditions relating to landscaping and screening the site.</P></DIV><DIV><H3>What permits and consents are required before fracking can take place and how is fracking monitored?</H3><P>The process of fracking, including the exploration and appraisal phases, are tightly controlled and subject to a number of regulatory regimes. Four regulatory bodies are involved in issuing consents and licenses for fracking. </P><P>The Department of Energy and <mark>Climate Change</mark> issues Petroleum Exploration and Development Licenses which give the holder exclusive rights to oil and gas exploration within a given area. This license does not give consent for drilling or any other development associated with gas exploration or production, which need to be subject to the regimes set out below. Further details on the licensing process are available on the <A href=""http://www.gov.uk/oil-and-gas-petroleum-licensing-guidance"">DECC website</A>.  </P><P>Planning permission from the Minerals Planning Authority is required at the exploration, appraisal and production phases of gas extraction. The Minerals Planning Authority for the National Park is the North York Moors National Park Authority. Applications for planning permission will be considered against the relevant planning policies and will include consideration of a range of effects such as visual impact, effects on the natural environment, effects on local amenity and vehicle movements. Applications for planning permission would need to be accompanied by an Environmental Impact Assessment. As part of the planning application process there would be an opportunity for members of the public to comment on the application.</P><P>The Environment Agency is responsible for issuing and monitoring permits related to water use, protecting water quality, the use of chemicals and the management of waste water. A permit will not be issued if it is considered that the activity would pose an unacceptable risk to the environment. The Environment Agency would also be consulted on any planning applications for fracking. More details about the Environment Agency’s role are available <A href=""http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/133885.aspx"">here</A>. </P><P>The Health and Safety Executive is responsible for regulating and monitoring the safety of the well and the site. Further details of the Health and Safety Executive’s role can be found <A href=""http://www.hse.gov.uk/offshore/unconventional-gas.htm"">here</A>. </P><P>Prior to drilling beginning, the Department of Energy and <mark>Climate Change</mark> must provide consent to drill. As part of this process, a Hydraulic Fracturing Programme must be prepared which will set out ways in which any seismic activity will be monitored and acted upon where necessary. This would be based on the Government’s <A href=""http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/270676/DECC_infographic_Traffic-light-system_finaldec13.pdf"" target=""_blank"">‘traffic light’ system</A>. </P><P>Further details of the licensing and permitting requirements are available <A href=""http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/265988/Onshore_UK_oil_and_gas_exploration_England_Dec13_contents.pdf"" target=""_blank"">here</A>. </P></DIV><H3>If an area has a Government license for gas exploration and development does this mean that fracking can take place?</H3><DIV><P>No. The Government periodically issues Petroleum Exploration and Development Licenses in geographical blocks, but planning permission and other permits must also be obtained prior to any activity taking place. The areas currently licensed are shown <A href=""http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/15095/landfields-lics.pdf"" target=""_blank"">here</A>. Licenses have been awarded in the southern part of the National Park and around Westerdale. A further round of licensing is anticipated to take place in 2015.</P><H3>If permission is granted for exploration does this mean that production can also take place?</H3></DIV><DIV><P>No. There are three distinct phases of gas development – exploration, appraisal and production. To determine whether production is likely to be commercially viable in any particular location, operators would need to obtain planning permission to carry out exploration to investigate details of the geology and the likely amounts of gas available. Planning permission and any other consents granted will relate specifically to the phase in question and do not mean that permission for production will subsequently be granted. The fracking process may be involved at any of these stages.</P><H3>How is a gas injection well distinct from fracking?</H3><P>Given the public interest in proposal <A href=""http://planning.northyorkmoors.org.uk/Northgate/Online/DMS/DocumentViewer.aspx?SearchType=Planning%20Application&amp;PK=810934"" target=""_blank"">NYM/2014/0587/EIA</A> (Natural gas production and water re-injection at the existing borehole at Ebberston Moor South Well Site, the drilling of a second borehole for water production and re-injection etc.), a planning application for conventional gas extraction, the following information outlines the differences. </P><P>Conventional gas extraction does not involve high pressure fracturing of the bed rock to enable shale gas to escape but is targeting gas at a shallower level. Normally, gas is under pressure and comes to the surface once it is drilled – the difference with this application is that water associated with the gas needs to be pumped out to enable the gas to then escape. That water then needs to be disposed of – which could be either through piping or tankering it away – however, in this instance the intention is to re-inject it back into a different geological layer.  Public concerns are around whether the water being pumped back under a certain level of pressure would trigger any seismic activity and whether the water could seep into other geological layers and contaminate potable water aquifers, which are essentially the source of drinking water for nearby towns. Both of these risks are extremely low – and the Coralline  Limestone water aquifer is many hundreds of metres above the layer receiving the injected water. It is also important to note that the water being re-injected has not been added to and unlike fracking fluid contains no chemicals or other pollutants – it is merely highly salty – many times more so than sea water.</P><P><STRONG>The proposal is for conventional gas extraction on a small scale</STRONG>, which will contribute a minor but useful contribution to the nation’s energy supply needs. This helps to bridge the challenge of moving towards a lower <mark>carbon</mark> economy which, to be successful, has to be managed in a phased way as coal fired power stations are eventually replaced by a combination of lower <mark>carbon</mark> and renewable energy sources. The North York Moors has a history of small scale conventional gas extraction which, until the national debate over fracking, raised no environmental or landscape concerns from residents or the wider public.</P><P><STRONG>The proposal is not a new development</STRONG>. It is not a completely new scheme, but a combination of two halves of schemes which have already been approved.  It represents joint working and cooperation by two gas exploration companies and therefore reduces the infrastructure requirements involved. Approval of this application means that gas from the Ebberston Moor field extracted by both companies will be piped to Knapton generating station, safeguarding local jobs and negating the need to construct a large gas processing plant at Thornton le Dale which was approved on appeal and which would have impacted adversely on local residents and the National Park.</P><P><STRONG>Environmental risks are negligible.</STRONG> Any risks involved in re-injecting produced water from the well site back into the geology in terms of water <mark>pollution</mark> or induced seismic activity have been fully assessed as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) with the application and this has been independently reviewed by consultants commissioned by the National Park Authority. There is nothing added to the ground water extracted, it is simply pumped back in its natural state into a different geological horizon under low pressure to allow the gas to be extracted.  The conclusions of the technical consultants are that such environmental impacts are negligible and “not significant&quot; in EIA terms.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1.0,1.0,Neutral

6.  The Briefs</P><P><STRONG><U>1.  Oil and the Global Economy</U></STRONG></P><P>Oil prices fell again last week on concerns that the OPEC production cut will not be enough to offset increasing US shale oil production. The reopening of two Libyan oilfields which could bring Libyan production back to the vicinity of 700,000 b/d added to the pressure on oil prices. At week’s close, New York futures were below $50 a barrel with London a couple of dollars higher, both down about 8 percent from their April peak of $54-$55 a barrel.</P><P>Moscow says it now has cut production by the pledged 300,000 b/d. However, this cut was from an artificially high base and does not mean very much. Given that the Saudis have cut more than their required share, the 1.8 million b/d OPEC/NOPEC cut seems to be complete for now. Given the increases in oil production elsewhere in the last six months, there seems to be general agreement that the production cut will need to be extended until the end of the year.  Otherwise it will be a failure and oil prices will continue to fall. Some observers are saying that the production cut will need to be continued at least through the first half of 2018. For now, however, it seems that only a six-month extension will be agreed upon at a meeting later this month.</P><P>A few analysts are saying that US shale oil production is likely to increase at a faster pace than the EIA has been estimating. Rystad Energy expects US shale oil output to grow by 100,000 b/d each month for the rest of this year and into 2018 if prices hold around $50-$55 a barrel.  This is considerably higher than the EIA projections that US production will grow by about 29,000 b/d each month in 2017 and 57,000 b/d in 2018.  Should Rystad be closer to the mark, it would wipe out much of the OPEC/NOPEC production cut, forcing prices lower.  Lower prices, of course, would reduce the incentive for US shale oil producers to increase production at the levels Rystad is projecting.  The US oil rig count rose for the 15<SUP>th</SUP> straight time last week to 870 rigs or 450 more than at this time last year. The shale oil industry still has a lot of rigs in storage, so it seems likely that the US rig count will continue to increase for a while.</P><P>Looking beyond the current concerns about OPEC vs. US shale oil production is the question of what the world’s oil supply will look like in the next decade. Since US shale oil production took off seven or eight years ago, the possibility of an imminent supply crunch or even peak global oil production has been dismissed by most observers.  However, worries about supply shortages due to the large decrease in oil industry capital expenditures again are being voiced by responsible observers. Last week we heard from Saudi Aramco and the International Energy Agency, both of which have voiced similar warnings in the past.  The IEA points out that worldwide only 2.4 billion barrels of new oil reserves were discovered last year and that the number of oil production projects receiving a final investment decision in 2016 was at the lowest since the 1940’s.</P><P>For now, major US oil companies are looking at investing more heavily in shale oil where wells cost less than $10 million to drill and frack as opposed to the billions of dollars that large offshore platforms cost. A few outside observers of the shale oil industry are saying that large production increases cannot continue for much more than a few years. The days of spectacular production increases from the Bakken and Eagle Ford shale oil formations seem to be ending; however, the Permian Basin may still have a way to go. US shale gas production in the Marcellus shal seems to be slipping already, undercutting optimism that US shale gas will be powering the world in coming years.</P><P>Global demand for oil is still on the order of 34 billion barrels per year and is likely to keep increasing by 400-500 million barrels each year.  While the subject of derision by many optimists, some form of peak oil still looks likely in the next decade from a combination of lower supplies, higher prices, concerns about <mark>climate change</mark>, or even new technologies.</P><P><STRONG><U>2.  The Middle East &amp; North Africa</U></STRONG></P><P><STRONG><U>Iran</U></STRONG>:  Tehran says it is willing to cap its oil production until the end of the year to help the Saudis raise oil production. Oil Minister Zanganeh said last week that Iran had kept its production at 3.8 million b/d under the agreement that allowed the country to limit its production rather than make an actual cut.</P><P>Six candidates have been approved by the Iran’s clerics to run in the May 19<SUP>th</SUP> presidential election.  While President Rouhani seems likely to win reelection, growing animosity with Washington and the continued deterioration of the Syrian situation makes the outlook for US-Iranian relations uncertain.</P><P><STRONG><U>Iraq</U></STRONG>: Efforts to comply with the production cut seems to have leveled off in March when the country’s crude production increased by 0.4 percent to 4.586 million b/d. The government claims to be fully complying with the OPEC/NOPEC production cut.  Baghdad says it too will go along with whatever consensus on the continuation of production cuts is reached at the next OPEC meeting on May 25<SUP>th</SUP>.</P><P>However, the country plans to increase its crude production by 600,000 b/d to 5 million b/d by the end of this year. Also, Iraq has started working on doubling the output of the Halfaya oil field to 400,000 b/d next year. The UKs Petrofrac has just be awarded a $70 million contract to expand Iraq’s port facilities in the Persian Gulf.  In December, the company received a $75 million contract to improve the export terminal at Basra. With big increases in production coming and the cost of producing Iraqi oil still well below world selling prices, Baghdad will be hard pressed to continue any production freeze into 2018 should that be necessary.</P><P><STRONG><U>Saudi Arabia</U></STRONG>: The value of Saudi Aramco is still a hot topic. The Saudi deputy crown prince Salman al Saud is still pushing the figure of $2 trillion as the company’s market value so that a five percent share should be worth about $100 billion.  The government has been adjusting tax policies lately so that the company would be able to pay a dividend after the IPO rather than just siphoning all the revenue into the national treasury. According to the <EM>Wall Street Journal</EM>, even Aramco insiders say that, even given the new tax policies, a valuation of the company at $1.3 to $1.5 trillion would be more realistic.  At one point, industry consultants Wood Mackenzie Ltd. were saying the company’s value was more like $400 billion.  The company likely will never release detailed production and reserve estimates that would give outside analysts a better chance of setting a proper value on the company.</P><P>Analysts are saying that the Saudis are losing market share to Iran and Iraq due to the production cut. The Saudis agreed to a cut of 486,000 b/d while the Iraqis said they would cut 210,000 b/d from a dubious base number. Iran was allowed to increase production by 90,000 b/d.  The Saudis continue to trash the various peak oil theories, both the supply, and the demand versions, and assert that the demand for oil will keep growing for decades.</P><P>The Saudis say they have foiled an attack launched from Yemen to blow up a Saudi oil production distribution center at Jazan on the Red Sea.</P><P><STRONG><U>Libya</U></STRONG>: The National Oil Company says it may have reached long-term agreements with local Petroleum Facilities Guard units to keep the Sharara oil field open and producing. There is much reason to be skeptical as in the past, such agreements have only lasted for a few weeks before somebody closes the taps and demands a bigger share of the pie. Libya produced 622,000 b/d in March, but production was way down in April due to the dispute. The company still says it hopes to be producing about 1.2 million b/d by the end of the year if disgruntled people will stop closing ports and pipelines they control. If Libya can reach its goal, its increased production will be a big problem for OPEC as the country is not under any obligation to keep its production under control.</P><P><STRONG><U>3.  China</U></STRONG></P><P>Newly released statistics show China’s economy is pulling back from the five-year high that was seen in the last two-quarters. A slipping Purchasing Manager’s Index suggests that manufacturing slipped in April. The new data showed a weakening in employment, output, new orders and export orders. In recent weeks, the government has been introducing tighter curbs on property investment and has been cutting back on infrastructure spending. Some economists are saying the growth in China’s GDP may slip to 6.6 percent this year from 6.7 percent last year.</P><P>The government announced that non-fossil fuel use would increase to 20 percent of energy consumption by 2030 and more than 50 percent by 2050. <mark>Carbon</mark> emissions are due to peak by 2030. This is all very nice, but many think we do not have another 35 years to fiddle with emissions before climatic conditions become so bad they will force change.</P><P><STRONG><U>4. Russia</U></STRONG></P><P>Some analysts are noting that it may be more difficult for Moscow to extend its 300,000 b/d production cutback into the second half. It is now clear that Moscow surged its output in the months before the cuts started so that their cut could be based on a higher than normal output and would not have as much impact. Traditionally Russian production slows during the harsh winter months and picks up again in the second half. A close look might reveal that Moscow did not cut any oil production that would not have occurred normally.</P><P>Russian oil companies have been announcing plans to increase production so that an obligation to maintain the 300,000 b/d cut through the end of the year would be much more of a hardship. So far, all indications suggest that Moscow will go along with the extension, otherwise there could be another rapid drop in oil prices that would be even more harmful.</P><P><STRONG><U>5. Venezuela</U></STRONG></P><P>The situation continues to deteriorate and the month-long anti-government protests continue.  So far two dozen are dead, hundreds injured and 1,500 arrested. Hungry mobs roam the streets at night looting any place they can break into searching for food. The Maduro government has lost the support of the lower classes that brought Chavez to power.   The Pope is calling for mediation, and there is talk of a right-wing military coup.</P><P>Some oil companies are pulling out their foreign workers as living there has become dangerous.  China evacuated its oil executives to Columbia a year ago as they became prime targets for kidnappers. Foreign oil executives living in Caracas are forced to live in guarded compounds and travel only by armored vehicle.</P><P>Most observers are saying the Venezuela crisis is reaching some sort of a peak. The government has lost the support of nearly all the people and is ruling by decree. The food and medicine situation gets worse and it is likely that oil revenues are dropping. Although much of the oil production activity is located away from where the demonstrations are taking place and oil workers are likely to have the first call on food supplies after the security forces, the situation is bound to deteriorate. The country has little foreign reserves left and cannot import enough essential goods to keep functioning.</P><P>The risk of a major drop in oil exports remains high. The recent surge in US oil product exports to Latin America is likely tied to declining Venezuelan refining activity.  It is difficult to see how the situation will not get worse before it gets better.</P><P><STRONG><U>7.  The Briefs</U></STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Oil Sands:</STRONG> As global oil majors pull out of Canada’s oil sands, domestic companies are buying up assets and betting technology and economies of scale will enable them to turn a profit despite low crude prices. Global energy majors have sold off more than $22.5 billion worth of Canadian oil sands assets so far this year, concerned about depressed oil prices, high production costs and <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and limited pipeline access to market. (4/29)</P><P><STRONG>BP</STRONG> has discovered 200 million barrels of oil in a hidden cache in the Gulf of Mexico, thanks to a technological breakthrough allowing the company to see beneath geological formations that had befuddled oil exploration for decades. The find, worth a potential $2 billion in recoverable oil, is in an undrilled section of BP’s Atlantis field in 7,000 feet of water 150 miles from New Orleans. (4/29)</P><P><STRONG>Coal Shutdown</STRONG>: A Murray Energy subsidiary has notified an Illinois state agency that it plans to lay off 255 employees <SPAN class=""aBn"" tabindex=""0"" data-term=""goog_1305507395""><SPAN class=""aQJ"">in three months</SPAN></SPAN> in a move that industry sources say would likely shut one of the company’s top producing Illinois Basin mines. (4/29)</P><P><STRONG>Rig Count</STRONG>: The number of active oil and gas rigs in the United States rose by 13 <SPAN class=""aBn"" tabindex=""0"" data-term=""goog_1305507396""><SPAN class=""aQJ"">on Friday</SPAN></SPAN>, according to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes. The total oil and gas rig count in the US now stands at 870 rigs, or 450 above the count a year ago. Oil rigs increased by 9, while gas rigs bumped up 4. (4/29)</P><P><STRONG>Offshore Drilling</STRONG>: President Donald Trump signed an executive order <SPAN class=""aBn"" tabindex=""0"" data-term=""goog_1305507397""><SPAN class=""aQJ"">Friday</SPAN></SPAN> to ease regulations on offshore drilling and eventually allow more to occur, particularly in the Arctic Ocean. The order, which takes aim at last-minute Obama administration actions restricting drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, will likely have limited immediate impact owing to low oil prices, which make drilling in the affected areas economically unattractive.  Environmental groups said preparations are already underway for a legal challenge. (4/29)</P><P><STRONG>The U.S. economy</STRONG> stumbled in the first months of the Trump administration, growing at the slowest pace <SPAN class=""aBn"" tabindex=""0"" data-term=""goog_1305507398""><SPAN class=""aQJ"">in three years</SPAN></SPAN> in a sobering reminder of the nation’s economic sluggishness. Gross domestic product grew at a 0.7% annual rate in the first quarter from the preceding three months, the Commerce Department said <SPAN class=""aBn"" tabindex=""0"" data-term=""goog_1305507399""><SPAN class=""aQJ"">Friday</SPAN></SPAN>. Economic output has grown an average of roughly 2% during the nearly eight-year expansion. (4/29)</P><P><STRONG>Shale Gas:</STRONG> The number of rigs drilling for gas has almost doubled since August, but output continues to fall. Even accounting for a lag between the start of drilling and first production, the drop in output is striking — a well in the Marcellus Shale, America’s most prolific reservoir of the fuel, is producing about half of what it yielded a year ago, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Companies are struggling to overcome steep decline rates — the natural decrease in production — from shale formations that were the source of huge added supplies in years past. (4/29)</P><P><STRONG>US gasoline demand</STRONG> fell 2.4 percent in February from a year earlier, the second straight monthly decline, according to data released <SPAN class=""aBn"" tabindex=""0"" data-term=""goog_1305507400""><SPAN class=""aQJ"">on Friday</SPAN></SPAN> by the U.S. Energy Information Administration that suggested the market may have trouble repeating last year’s record volumes. (4/29)</P><P><STRONG>US supermajors</STRONG> exceed analysts’ estimates with cost cuts. Chevron turned a corner after its worst annual performance since 1980.  Fresh off Big Oil’s best quarter in years, Exxon Mobil and Chevron may be poised for a repeat. One-third of the way into the second quarter, crude prices — the prime driver of explorers’ profits — are 25 percent higher than a year ago. (4/29)</P><P><STRONG>Pemex</STRONG>’s Board of Director approved its second-ever deepwater joint venture covering the Nobilis-Maximino block in the country’s territorial Gulf waters. (4/28)</P><P><STRONG>President Trump’</STRONG>s remarks about Alaska and senate measures on offshore drilling may point to an executive action on oil and gas. “We’re going to take care of Alaska too,” President Donald Trump told Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, during remarks on the signing of an executive order on national lands. “Don’t worry about it.” (4/28)</P><P><STRONG>Oil Futures</STRONG>: The number of outstanding oil contracts for delivery years into the future has plummeted on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Since 2012 open interest has declined by more than 75 percent for benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude expiring in three or four years’ time. During the same period, the entire WTI market has expanded by 40 per cent.  (4/28)</P><P><STRONG>ExxonMobil</STRONG> has continued its streak of hiking its dividend, announcing another increase in its payout to shareholders <SPAN class=""aBn"" tabindex=""0"" data-term=""goog_1305507401""><SPAN class=""aQJ"">on Wednesday</SPAN></SPAN>. The oil major has boosted its dividend every year for more than three decades, but the collapse of oil prices since 2014 has resulted in more scrutiny over the company’s payments to shareholders. (4/28)</P><P><STRONG>Polish energy company</STRONG>, PGNiG said <SPAN class=""aBn"" tabindex=""0"" data-term=""goog_1305507402""><SPAN class=""aQJ"">Thursday</SPAN></SPAN> it closed on a deal to take its first-ever shipment of liquefied natural gas sourced from reservoirs in the United States. PGNiG said its trading branch in London closed on a deal to accept LNG from Cheneire Energy, which owns a terminal in Louisiana that’s the only one with the permits necessary for current exports of U.S. natural gas.

REUTERS/Hardi Baktiantoro/Files</P></SPAN></FIGCAPTION></DIV></DIV><P>A year later, the project is close to collapse, a casualty of labyrinthine Indonesian bureaucracy, opaque laws and a secretive palm oil company.  </P><P>The Rimba Raya project, on the island of Borneo, is part of a United Nations-backed scheme designed to reward poorer nations that protect their <mark>carbon</mark>-rich jungles.  </P><P>Deep peat in some of Indonesia’s rainforests stores billions of tonnes of <mark>carbon</mark> so preserving those forests is regarded as crucial in the fight against <mark>climate change</mark>.  </P><P>By putting a value on the <mark>carbon</mark>, the 90,000-hectare (225,000 acre) project would help prove that investors can turn a profit from the world’s jungles in ways that do not involve cutting them down.  </P><P>After three years of work, more than $2 million in development costs, and what seemed like the green light from Jakarta, the project is proof that saving the world’s tropical rainforests will be far more complicated than simply setting up a framework to allow market forces to function.  </P><P>A Reuters investigation into the case also shows the forestry ministry is highly skeptical about a market for forest <mark>carbon</mark> credits, placing it at odds with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who supports pay-and-preserve investments to fight <mark>climate change</mark>.  </P><P>Hong Kong-based Lemons, 47, a veteran of environmentally <mark>sustainable</mark>, and profitable, projects, discovered just how frustrating the ministry can be to projects such as his.  </P><P>“Success was literally two months around the corner,” he said. “We went through — if there are 12 steps, we went through the first 11 on time over a 2-year period. We had some glitches, but by and large we went through the rather lengthy and complicated process in the time expected.”</P><P>That’s when the forestry ministry decided to slash the project’s area in half, making it unviable, and handing a large chunk of forested deep peatland to a palm oil company for development.  </P><P>The case is a stark reminder to Norway’s government, the world’s top donor to projects to protect tropical forests, on just how tough it will be to preserve Indonesia’s rainforests under its $1 billion <mark>climate</mark> deal with Jakarta.  </P><H3>UNLIMITED CORRUPTION  </H3><P>The dispute has turned a spotlight on Indonesia’s forestry ministry, which earns $15 billion a year in land permit fees from investors. Indonesia’s Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) said last month it will investigate the granting of forest permits and plans to crack down on corruption in the resources sector.  </P><P>“It’s a source of unlimited corruption,” said Chandra M. Hamzah, deputy chairman at the KPK.  </P><P>Indonesia Corruption Watch, a private watchdog, says illegal logging and violations in issuing forest use permits are rampant. It estimates ill-gotten gains total about 20 trillion rupiah ($2.3 billion) each year.  </P><P>A forest ministry official connected with the U.N.-backed forest <mark>carbon</mark> offset scheme was sentenced in April to three years in prison for accepting a $10,000 bribe to ensure an Indonesian company won a procurement tender.  </P><P>Wandojo Siswanto was one of the negotiators for Indonesia’s delegation at the 2009 U.N. <mark>climate</mark> talks in Copenhagen, despite being a bribery suspect. His case has highlighted concerns about the capacity of the forestry ministry to manage forest-<mark>carbon</mark> projects.  </P><P>The forestry sector has a long history of mismanagement and graft. Former trade and industry minister Bob Hasan, a timber czar during the Suharto years, was fined 50 billion rupiah ($7 million) for ordering the burning of forests in Sumatra and then imprisoned in a separate case of forestry fraud after Suharto was toppled from power in 1998.  </P><P>In an interview in Jakarta, senior forestry ministry officials denied any wrongdoing in the Rimba Raya case and criticized the project’s backers for a deal they made with Russia’s <mark>Gazprom</mark>, the world’s largest gas producer, to market the project’s <mark>carbon</mark> credits.  </P><P>Internal forestry ministry documents that Reuters obtained show how the ministry reversed its support for the project after a new minister came in, and a large chunk of the project’s land was turned over to a palm oil firm.  </P><P>The case illustrates how growing demand for land, bureaucratic hurdles and powerful vested interests are major obstacles to conservation projects in Indonesia and elsewhere in the developing world.  </P><P>That makes it hard for these projects to compete and navigate through multiple layers of government with the potential for interference and delay.  </P><P>“We have systematically not been able to demonstrate that we can complete the loop to turn projects into dollar investments,” said Andrew Wardell, program director, forests and governance, at the Center for International Forestry Research in Indonesia.  </P><P>“Which is why the palm oil industry is winning hands down every time.”</P><H3>SHOWCASE PROJECT  </H3><P>The Rimba Raya project was meant to save a large area of <mark>carbon</mark>-rich peat swamp forest in Central Kalimantan province and showcase Jakarta’s efforts to fight <mark>climate change</mark>.  </P><P>Much of the area is dense forest that lies atop oozy black peat flooded by tea-colored water. Dozens of threatened or endangered species such as orangutans, proboscis monkeys, otter civets and Borneo bay cats live in the area, which is adjacent to a national park.  </P><P>Rimba Raya was designed to be part of the U.N’s Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) program. The idea is simple: every tonne of <mark>carbon</mark> locked away in the peat and soaked up by the trees would earn a steady flow of <mark>carbon</mark> credits.  </P><P>Profit from the sale of those credits would go to project investors and partners, local communities and the Indonesian government. That would allow the project to pay its way and compete with palm oil farmers and loggers who might otherwise destroy it.  </P><P>Rich countries and big companies can buy the credits to offset their emissions.  </P><DIV class=""container_1tVQo"" tabindex=""-1""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption_KoNH1""><P>Birute Mary Galdikas, the founder of Orangutan Foundation International (OFI), visits a feeding station at OFI's orangutan care and quarantine centre in Pangkalan Bun in the province of Central Kalimantan in this undated handout photo courtesy of InfiniteEARTH. REUTERS/InfiniteEARTH/Handout</P></SPAN></FIGCAPTION></DIV><P>By preserving a large area of peat swamp forest, Rimba Raya was projected to cut <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by nearly 100 million tonnes over its 30-year life, which would translate into total saleable credits of about $500 million, <mark>Gazprom</mark> says.  </P><P>It would also be a sanctuary for orphaned or rehabilitated orangutans from elsewhere in Borneo. Rimba Raya teamed up with the founder of Orangutan Foundation International, Birute Mary Galdikas, in which OFI would receive a steady income from annual <mark>carbon</mark> credit sales.  </P><P>It was the sort of project President Yudhoyono and Norway have pledged to support. Yudhoyono has put forests — Indonesia is home to the world’s third-largest forest lands — at the center of a pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 26 percent by 2020.  </P><P>He tasked a senior adviser to press for reforms to make REDD projects easier and for greater transparency at the forestry ministry.  </P><H3>GOLD STANDARD  </H3><P>Rimba Raya was poised for success. It got backing from the Clinton Foundation’s <mark>Climate</mark> Initiative, which helped pay for some of the early costs. <mark>Gazprom</mark> invested more than $1 million.  </P><P>It was the first in the world to meet stringent REDD project rules under the Washington-based Voluntary <mark>Carbon</mark> Standard, an industry-respected body that issues <mark>carbon</mark> credits. Rimba Raya was also the first to earn a triple-gold rating under the <mark>Climate</mark>, Community and Biodiversity Alliance, a separate verifier.  </P><P>Companies including German insurer Allianz and Japanese telecoms giant NTT pledged to buy credits from the project if it gets its license.  </P><P>In December 2009, the forestry ministry tentatively named the now Indonesian-registered company PT Rimba Raya Conservation the license holder for nearly 90,000 ha, contingent on it passing an environmental impact assessment. It did so a few months later.  </P><P>The ownership of PT Rimba Raya Conservation is split 70 percent foreign and 30 percent Indonesian, with Lemons and business partner Jim Procanik holding small stakes.  </P><P>Lemons is CEO of Hong Kong-based firm InfiniteEARTH, which is the developer and manager of the Rimba Raya project as well as investment fund-raiser. Procanik, 44, is the managing director.  </P><P>In June last year, Forestry Minister Zulkifli Hasan asked for a map that would set the final boundary of the project, according to a copy of the instruction seen by Reuters. This mandatory step normally takes a few weeks. Once the map is issued, a project is eligible for a license to operate.  </P><P>But by September last year it was clear something was wrong, according to Lemons. Despite repeated promises by ministry officials, the final map had not been issued. No explanations were given.  </P><P>“No one has ever said, ‘No’. So that’s exhausting,” said Lemons.  </P><P>What followed instead was a series of steps by the forestry ministry that have resulted in the project being undermined.  </P><P>A ministry review focused on conflicting claims to the land by several companies belonging to palm oil firm, PT Best Group.  </P><P>PT Best, which is run by Indonesian brothers Winarto and Winarno Tjajadi, had long coveted the peat land within the area the forestry ministry set aside for the Rimba Raya project.  </P><P>On December 31, 2010, PT Best was granted 6,500 ha of peat swamp land for palm oil development, next to a smaller parcel of deep peat land granted a year earlier — part of PT Best’s broader plan to connect its palm oil plantations in the north with a port on the coast nearby. The land granted last December was part of the original area set aside for Rimba Raya.  </P><P>The Tjajadi brothers declined several requests by Reuters to comment.  </P><P>The December allocation to PT Best came despite assurances from Forestry Minister Hasan that he would not allow deep peatlands to be converted for agriculture.  </P><P>The allocation also came a day before a two-year moratorium on issuing licenses to clear primary forests and peat lands was due to start on January 1 this year. The moratorium is a key part of the <mark>climate</mark> deal with Norway.  </P><P>After months of delay, the forestry ministry finally ruled that PT Rimba Raya was only eligible for 46,000 ha, a decision that cut out much of the peatlands covering nearly half the original project area.  </P><H3>OMBUDSMAN INVESTIGATES  </H3><P>The case has now been brought before the office of the Indonesian government’s Ombudsman. In an interview, senior Ombudsman Dominikus Fernandes told Reuters he believed the forestry ministry should issue the license to Rimba Raya.  </P><P>“If Rimba Raya has already fulfilled the criteria, there should not be a delay in issuing the license,” he said.  </P><P>“This is a model project in Indonesia that should be prioritized. If we don’t give an example on the assurance of investing in Indonesia, that’s not a good thing.”</P><P>Officials from the forestry ministry, in a lengthy interview with Reuters, said the area was given legally for palm oil development because PT Best had claims to the land dating back to 2005.  </P><P>Secretary-General of the ministry Hadi Daryanto stressed the peatland areas originally granted to Rimba Raya were on a type of forest called convertible production forest, which can be used for agriculture but not REDD projects. Handing that nearly 40,000 ha to Rimba Raya would be against the law, he said.  </P><DIV class=""inline-container_1QqKC mega_19SOz""><FIGCAPTION class=""caption_2BUXy"">Slideshow<SPAN class=""count_3OPtf""> (7 Images)</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></DIV><P>Yet in 2009, the ministry was ordered to make the title switch for this same area of peatland so it could be used for a REDD project. The instruction to immediately make the switch, a bureaucratic formality, was never acted on.  </P><P>In the Oct 2009 decree seen by Reuters, former Forestry Minister H.M.S. Kaban issued the order as part of a broader instruction setting aside the nearly 90,000 ha for ecosystem restoration projects. Kaban left office soon after.  </P><P>Indonesian law also bans any clearing of peat lands more than 3 meters deep. An assessment of the Rimba Raya area by a peat expert hired by InfiniteEARTH showed the peat is 3 to 7 meters deep, so in theory was out of bounds for PT Best to clear for agriculture.  </P><P>For Lemons, 47, the mood has switched from exhilaration to bitter disappointment. “We’ve been here every day pushing like hell from every angle,” he said.  </P><P>Procanik says the disappointment is personal. “Todd and I have both invested what savings we had for our kids’ college education in this project,” he said.  </P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> is also upset.  </P><P>In a letter dated June 16 to the Indonesian government, the Russian firm criticized the ministry’s failure to issue the license for Rimba Raya and threatened to abandon clean-energy projects in Indonesia estimated to be worth more than $100 million in foreign investment. The government has yet to respond.  </P><H3><mark>CARBON</mark> DREAMS?  </H3><P>Secretary-General Daryanto and Iman Santoso, Director-General for forestry business management, said another major problem was InfiniteEARTH’s deal with <mark>Gazprom</mark>, which was made in the absence of any license.  </P><P>“We didn’t know about the contract with <mark>Gazprom</mark>. They had no legal right to make the contract,” Daryanto told Reuters.  </P><P>Santoso described it as the project’s “fatal mistake.”</P><P>Daryanto also questioned whether REDD would ever work and whether there was any global appetite for <mark>carbon</mark> credits the program generates, a view at odds with other parts of the Indonesian government, which has been actively supporting REDD projects.  </P><P>“Who will pay for the dream of Rimba Raya? Who will pay? Nobody, sir!” Daryanto told Reuters during an interview in the heavily forested ministry compound near central Jakarta.  </P><P>Lemons said the <mark>Gazprom</mark> deal was explained in person during a presentation of a 300-page technical proposal submitted to the ministry to prove the project would be financially viable. Daryanto was among a ministry panel that approved the proposal.  </P><P>“One of their biggest concerns was whether REDD could deliver the same revenues to the state as other land-use permits such as palm oil, logging, mining. We were required to show contracts that demonstrated we could pay the fees and annual royalties,” he said.  </P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark>, designated as the sole marketer of <mark>carbon</mark> credits from Rimba Raya, said it had already agreed long-term sales contracts with buyers at between 7 and 8 euros ($10 to $11.40) per tonne — contingent on the license being issued.  </P><P>“We’ve sold to four or five companies around that price,” said Dan Barry, <mark>Gazprom</mark> Marketing &amp; Trading’s London-based global director of clean energy.  </P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> became involved, he said, because it was a project that looked to have official support. The Russian company agreed to a financing mechanism that ensured the project’s viability for 30 years, regardless of the price level of <mark>carbon</mark> markets.  </P><P>Those markets, centered on the European and U.N. <mark>carbon</mark> trading programs, were valued at $142 billion in 2010, the World Bank says. National <mark>carbon</mark> trading schemes are planned for Australia and South Korea, while California is planning a state-based scheme from 2013. New Zealand’s <mark>carbon</mark> market started in 2008.  </P><P>“If you ever want a successful REDD scheme, you are going to have to have a process that people believe in,” Barry said.  </P><P>“The Ministry of Forestry ought to be doing everything it can to support a program that benefits forestry as opposed to favor a program that’s there to cut it down and turn it into palm oil.”</P><H3>“AHEAD OF ITS TIME”</H3><P>Kuntoro Mangkusubroto, the head of the REDD task force in Indonesia who is also in charge of the president’s government reforms unit, said the Rimba Raya case highlighted deep flaws in the bureaucracy and the need for sweeping reforms to underpin the 40 other REDD projects in Indonesia.  </P><P>“The core concern is the trust in government statements of readiness, and responsibility,” he told Reuters in an email. “Even with the best of intentions, the unsynchronous action of the central government’s ministry and the district government’s action is not conducive for investment, especially in this new kind of venture.  </P><P>“I can surmise that the case of Rimba Raya is a case of a business idea that is ahead of its time. The government infrastructure is insufficiently ready for it.”</P><P>Legal action was one solution to this case, he added.  </P><P>That is a path Lemons and Procanik may eventually take but for now they have proposed a land swap deal with PT Best in which the firm gives PT Rimba Raya 9,000 ha of peat land in return for a similar sized piece of non-peat land held by PT Rimba Raya in the north of the project near other PT Best landholdings.  </P><P>PT Best rejected an earlier offer by Rimba Raya of 9 percent of the credits from the project, Lemons said.  </P><P>Based on recent satellite images, PT Best has yet to develop the disputed 9,000 ha area.  </P><P>The delays mean it is too late for Rimba Raya to become the world’s first project to issue REDD credits. That accolade has since gone to a Kenyan project.  </P><P>“Our whole point here is to show host countries that REDD can pay its way,” said Lemons. “And if it can’t pay its way then we haven’t proven anything.”</P><P>In a sign a resolution could still be possible, Ombudsman Fernandes, Forestry Minister Hasan and PT Rimba Raya are scheduled to meet on Aug 19.  </P><DIV class=""container_28wm1""><DIV class=""attribution_o4ojT""><P class=""content_27_rw"">Additional reporting by Olive Rondonuwu and Yayat Supriatna in Jakarta and Harry Suhartono in Singapore; Editing by Simon Webb, Simon Robinson and Bill Tarrant</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,2.0,Positive

Experts said he could, among other actions, slash funding for scientific research and technology, end tax credits for electric cars and solar roofs, and mount a comprehensive legal fight against the state’s ability to regulate greenhouse gases from polluting industries.</P><P>The showdown could ripple to other states that have or plan to follow California’s policies, such as reducing vehicle emissions, forcing power utilities to increasingly use renewable sources of energy and requiring industry to pay money for the right to pollute.</P><P>Gov. <A id=""PEPLT007547"" title=""Jerry Brown"" href=""/topic/politics-government/jerry-brown-PEPLT007547-topic.html"">Jerry Brown</A> has said he and other state lawmakers are ready to stand up to Trump’s team.</P><P>“We’re going to mobilize in the face of what is obviously a rather adverse atmosphere, politically speaking, for what we’re trying to do,” Brown said during a news conference Tuesday in San Diego, where he announced that California is asking the <A id=""PEPLT007408"" title=""Barack Obama"" href=""/topic/politics-government/government/barack-obama-PEPLT007408-topic.html"">Obama</A> administration to <A href=""http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/environment/sd-me-ocean-acidification-20161212-story.html"" target=""_blank"">create a permanent ban</A> on oil and gas drilling off the West Coast.</P><P>“I think we really need to be geared up for the long term, and I think we’ll maybe really strengthen our capacity in the controversies and challenges that come up in the next couple years,” he said.</P><P>Top Republicans in Congress — as well as automakers, oil companies and other businesses subject to California’s greenhouse-gas rules — welcome Trump’s views on global warming and <A href=""http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-epa-20161207-story.html"" target=""_blank"">his nominations to key agency</A> posts that control environmental decisions.</P><P>“While it makes everybody feel good to drive businesses out of California in the name of environmental purity, we’re really not accomplishing much of anything with respect to the <mark>climate</mark>,” said Jim Burling, director of litigation for the Pacific Legal Foundation, a Sacramento-based nonprofit that litigates and lobbies on behalf of companies around the country. The group’s stated goals are “limited government and a balanced approach to environmental protection.”</P><P>Through a series of financial penalties and incentives linked to several landmark laws, California has ushered in widespread installation of rooftop solar panels, more energy-efficient buildings, the nation’s first cap-and-trade program and, perhaps most notably, rigorous benchmarks for cutting <mark>pollution</mark> from factories to diesel trucks. Under the current trajectory, the state’s <mark>climate</mark>-change campaign will account for as much as <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/08/us/trump-<mark>climate</mark>-change.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news"" target=""_blank"">5 percent of the United States’ annual greenhouse-gas reductions</A> during the next decade.</P><P>Since first approving its <A href=""https://www.arb.ca.gov/newsrel/2030_<mark>carbon</mark>_target_adaptation_faq.pdf"" target=""_blank"">emissions-lowering goals</A> in 2006, California has slashed its yearly <mark>climate</mark>-warming emissions by about 35 million metric tons. The state’s current annual emissions are 441.5 million metric tons, a number that must drop to 431 million metric tons by 2020 to meet a designated threshold.</P><P>Officials are in the middle of <A href=""https://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/scopingplan/2030target_sp_dd120216.pdf"" target=""_blank"">updating the state’s blueprint</A> for shrinking such emissions — the California Air Resources Board’s 2030 Target Scoping Plan. The Legislature has committed to reaching an eye-popping 259 million metric tons of emissions by 2030, a decline of roughly 182 million metric tons from today’s level. That difference is more than what the state’s entire transportation sector spews into the atmosphere in a year.</P><P><STRONG>FOR THE RECORD:</STRONG> An earlier version of this story gave an incorrect figure for California’s targeted drop in greenhouse-gas emissions between now and 2030. The Union-Tribune regrets the error.</P><P> </P><H3>Possible hurdles</H3><P>Satisfying the state’s targets won’t be easy. To make significant progress, California will likely need to ratchet up or overhaul its <A href=""https://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/capandtrade/capandtrade.htm"" target=""_blank"">cap-and-trade program</A> and pass new legislation to further regulate industries that have for years opposed such oversight.</P><P>Those businesses and other critics of the state’s <mark>climate</mark>-change policies could gain a powerful ally if Trump’s administration does prove hostile toward the California benchmarks.</P><P>Experts said the next president and his deputies could eliminate <mark>climate</mark>-related categories of federal funding for universities and national laboratories in California, as well as discourage private-sector grants for development of emerging technologies such as grid-scale battery storage and low-<mark>carbon</mark> fuels.</P><P>They also could try to <A href=""http://legal-planet.org/2016/11/11/what-does-a-trump-presidency-portend-for-californias-environmental-policies/"" target=""_blank"">bind state lawmakers hands’ on key regulatory issues</A>, according to legal scholars.</P><P>Executives from a host of industries — ranging from farming interests to petroleum and natural gas companies — have repeatedly argued that on <mark>climate change</mark>, California violates the federal pre-emption doctrine that prohibits certain state policies from exceeding federal laws. They will likely lobby the Trump administration to back lawsuits claiming that California has overstepped its legal authority under what’s known as the supremacy clause.</P></DIV><DIV class=""trb_ar_page"" data-role=""pagination_page"" data-content-page=""2""><P>Trump might work with the GOP-led Congress to bolster the companies’ legal leverage, said Richard Frank, director of the California Environmental Law &amp; Policy Center at UC Davis’ law school.</P><P>“(They) could cast new federal laws declaring specifically that what California is trying to do is contrary to the national interest and is pre-empted,” Frank said. “That would be the most dramatic and, I would say, radical step.” </P><P>Mary Nichols, chair of the state’s air board, has expressed skepticism that the Trump administration would attempt such a legislative move. She has publicly vowed to move forward with the agency’s growing role in regulating <mark>climate</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> in California.</P><P>Also on the legislative front, analysts said Trump and his team could try to strip references to <mark>climate</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> out of the Clean Air Act, which would then complicate or even hobble efforts by California and other states to rely on that cornerstone law in fashioning their greenhouse-emissions rules.</P><P>And the incoming administration might gut the <A id=""ORGOV000048"" title=""U.S. Environmental Protection Agency"" href=""/topic/environmental-issues/u.s.-environmental-protection-agency-ORGOV000048-topic.html"">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</A> — the predominant federal enforcer of <mark>climate</mark>-change rules.</P><H3>Trump’s potential deputies</H3><P>Several moves by Trump in recent weeks seem to signal a desire to follow through on his campaign statements about <mark>climate change</mark>, which included a pledge to walk away from the international <mark>climate</mark> accord forged last year in Paris. That treaty, which 195 nations have joined, commits each government to lowering emissions and calls for wealthier countries to assist developing ones with money and technology.</P><P>Trump’s highest-profile decision so far about the environment has been his nomination of <A id=""PEPLT005339"" title=""Scott Pruitt"" href=""/topic/politics-government/scott-pruitt-PEPLT005339-topic.html"">Scott Pruitt</A> to head the EPA.</P><P>Pruitt, currently the Oklahoma attorney general, <A href=""http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/us/politics/energy-firms-in-secretive-alliance-with-attorneys-general.html?_r=0&amp;referer="" target=""_blank"">has led a cadre of state attorneys general</A> in coordinated lawsuits against federal policies on greenhouse emissions, including those set by the EPA. He has somewhat acknowledged the existence of <mark>climate change</mark> but questioned whether human activity is playing any role. He also has disputed the severity of <mark>climate change</mark>’s effects as predicted by most of the scientific community.</P><P>During an October episode of the “Exploring Energy” radio show in Oklahoma, Pruitt said: “Is it truly man-made or is this just simply another period of time where the Earth is cooling, increasing in heat? Is it just typical, natural type of occurrences as opposed what the (Obama) administration says? … What people don’t realize is that what the scientists have done is input data into a computer and produced modeling as far as the trajectory of what’s going to occur. It’s predictive in nature. It’s speculative in nature. It’s not objectively measured, as far as us knowing for sure what’s going to occur.”</P><P>Shortly after news broke of Pruitt’s nomination, governor Brown’s executive secretary, Nancy McFadden, made <A href=""https://twitter.com/NancyEMcFadden/status/806667480395497472"" target=""_blank"">this post on Twitter</A>: “Next commander-in-chief picks <mark>climate change</mark> denier-in-chief to lead @EPA.

The election of Trump has created some optimism,” said Scott, whose organization represents 22,000 small business owners in California and 325,000 nationally.</P><P>Trump then nominated <A id=""PEGPF00213"" title=""Ryan Zinke"" href=""/topic/politics-government/ryan-zinke-PEGPF00213-topic.html"">Ryan Zinke</A>, a former Navy SEAL and currently a Republican congressman representing Montana's at-large district, to become secretary of the U.S. Interior Department, a position that directs oil and gas drilling on federal lands and waters.</P><P>While Zinke has for years insisted the federal government should retain control of the nation's public lands, he has disagreed with the Obama administration's <mark>climate</mark> agenda by backing industry efforts to resume or expand logging and coal mining in those areas. He also has repeatedly voted in favor of preserving the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which relies on royalties from fossil-fuel exploration on public lands.</P><P>As for his perspective on <mark>climate change</mark>, Zinke said this in 2014 to the Billings Gazette newspaper in Montana: &quot;It's not a hoax, but it's not proven science either.&quot;</P><P>Beyond the Pruitt and Zinke picks, Trump and his transition team recently stoked concerns by issuing a <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/us/politics/<mark>climate</mark>-change-energy-department-donald-trump-transition.html?_r=0"" target=""_blank"">controversial memo</A> to the U.S. Energy Department.

During George W. Bush’s presidency, the EPA <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/19/washington/20epa-web.html"" target=""_blank"">blocked the state’s initial bid</A> to regulate greenhouse emissions from automakers’ vehicle fleets.</P><P>Until then, California had for decades received waivers for regulating traditional emissions from cars and light-duty trucks beyond what’s allowed under federal rules — a unique privilege granted in the 1970 Clean Air Act that grandfathered in the state’s regulatory authority but required ongoing approval from the EPA.</P><P>After taking office, President Barack Obama and his team not only granted California’s waiver application but extended state’s vehicle emission standards to the whole country. Those regulations, which took effect in 2012, in part require automakers to reduce greenhouse emissions by raising the average fuel efficiency of their vehicle fleets to 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016.</P><P>Two days after Trump won the election last month, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-regulations-trump-exclusive-idUSKBN1352EI"" target=""_blank"">appealed to Trump</A> to revisit the rules. The trade group represents General Motors, Ford Motor Co., <mark>Toyota Motor Corp.</mark> and other car makers.</P><P>Also last month, the Obama administration <A href=""http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-gas-mileage-standards-20161130-story.html"" target=""_blank"">fast-tracked a review</A> of the vehicle-fuel-efficiency program in an effort to more firmly lock in its targeted standards for future years. For example, it wants to mandate that automakers offer vehicle fleets with an average of more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025.</P><P>Such rules are a central part of strategies by both the federal and California governments to slash <mark>climate</mark> <mark>pollution</mark>. Transportation accounts for 26 percent of all greenhouse emissions nationally — and 37 percent in California.</P><P>If the Trump administration rolls back the national auto-emissions standards, California’s own vehicle-emissions regulations could take on a heightened significance. As <A href=""https://iaspub.epa.gov/otaqpub/display_file.jsp?docid=16888&amp;flag=1"">allowed by the Clean Air Act</A>, more than a dozen other states have adopted those rules as well. They include New York, Texas, Pennsylvania and Georgia.  </P><P>“I would say it’s all hands on deck. We have too much at stake,” said the recently retired California Senator <A id=""PEPLT005102"" title=""Fran Pavley"" href=""/topic/politics-government/fran-pavley-PEPLT005102-topic.html"">Fran Pavley</A>, who spearheaded the state’s most prominent legislation on <mark>climate change</mark> during her 35-year political career.</P><P>Pruitt, the EPA nominee, has long urged the federal government and courts to give states more autonomy. He started a so-called “federalist unit” within the Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office to oppose what he saw as federal encroachment.</P><P>But Pruitt’s state-powers position could easily flip, said <A href=""http://www.marquette.edu/polisci/faculty_nolette.shtml"">Paul Nolette</A>, a political science professor at Marquette University in Wisconsin and author of the 2015 book “Federalism on Trial: State Attorneys General and National Policy Making in Contemporary America.”</P><P>“There has indeed been a lot of talk already about returning power to the states under a Trump-Pruitt EPA, but I don’t buy that that’s the way things will turn out,” he said.</P><P>“The EPA would be unlikely to allow California and other piggy-backing states to raise (vehicle emissions) standards and will defend against claims from Becerra and other blue-state (attorneys general) that the federal government is violating states’ rights,” he added.</P><H3>In-state pressures</H3><P>All of this political uncertainty comes as California policy makers try to weigh which <mark>climate</mark> strategies have worked and which they might consider abandoning.</P><P>Many of the state’s <mark>climate</mark>-change programs aren’t proven yet, in large part because the economic crisis of the past decade has created the side effect of dampening activities that generate a lot of greenhouse emissions — from car commutes to factory production.</P><P>“Connecting greenhouse gas-reductions to a specific policy is difficult. Since we don’t yet have a good handle on the effectiveness of the policies California has implemented thus far, it’s hard to plan for the future,” said Andrew Campbell, executive director of UC Berkeley’s Energy Institute at Haas.</P><P>“California’s done very well in terms of greenhouse-gas emissions, but that’s mostly because of some of the slowdown we had during the mortgage crisis,” he added.</P><P>Another major question mark for California is its cap-and-trade system, which is being challenged in state courts by the California Chamber of Commerce. Critics of the program contend that it amounts to a tax and as such would have needed approval by two-thirds of the Legislature.</P><P>California has been receiving support for the program under Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which encourages states to set up similar cap-and-trade systems for power plants. The plan, which Obama created through executive action, followed the congressional defeat of a proposed national program to sell <mark>carbon</mark> allowances.</P><P>Trump and his team could very well strive to minimize the Clean Power Plan or kill it outright, although such efforts would likely involve years of administrative and legal wrangling.</P><P>In the meantime, California seems determined to continue its efforts to persuade other states — especially its close trading partners — to join its cap-and-trade system. In 2013, the state’s regulators finalized an agreement with Québec, Canada to integrate the two governments’ cap-and-trade programs. The Canadian government has called on all other provinces to roll out such programs, with Ontario scheduled to adopt one next year that would also be linked to California’s.  </P><P>Washington state plans to implement its own cap-and-trade system in January. Oregon has been studying an emissions trading program, but has not reached a decision on whether to move forward with it.</P><ASIDE class=""trb_em trb_embed "" data-content-embedlocation=""Embed + (3)"" data-content-id=""91593066"" data-content-size=""large"" data-content-type=""video"" data-content-slug=""sd-me-v-must-see-headlines"" data-content-subtype=""premiumvideo"" data-role=""sc_item  mediamanager_container  imgsize_ratiosizecontainer lightbox_container  "" data-state="""" data-embed-id=""91593066""><DIV class=""trb_em_m""><DIV class=""trb_em_r"" data-role=""lightbox_metadata""><DIV class=""trb_em_r_ca""><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ASIDE></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1.0,1.0,Neutral

This is the first major management reshuffle in Chinaoil’s 24-year history.</P><P>It is one of the most influential roles in the fiercely competitive global oil trading business, with a portfolio that spans a nearly 3,000-strong workforce, trading teams in oil hubs from Singapore to London to Houston, stakes in refineries in Asia and Europe, and storage in the Caribbean.</P><P>A PetroChina press official confirmed Wang’s retirement but declined to comment on her replacement. The sources did not want to be named as the reshuffle has not been made public.</P><P>An internal announcement was issued last week, the sources said. It is not clear when the official handover will take place.</P><P>One of the sources briefed on the matter said Tian will keep his current role as PetroChina marketing head after taking up the Chinaoil position.</P><P>“If Tian is to continue his double-hat top role at the domestic fuel sales, he will then have a much larger base of resources to work on,” said another of the sources, a former senior Chinaoil trader.</P><P>The choice of her successor marks a significant shift for Chinaoil. Tian, who the sources say is in his mid-50s and has worked his way up through PetroChina for as long as Wang ran Chinaoil, is joining a close-knit business that has seen its top team of trading executives little changed since its set-up in 1993.</P><P>He has big shoes to fill as Wang, 60, who is known by staff and peers as Madame Wang, steps down as the country’s single longest-serving top oil trading executive.</P><P>She is credited with building Chinaoil into one of the world’s most prominent oil trading companies.</P><P>In 2015, Chinaoil traded about 3 million barrels per day of crude oil and refined fuels, more than Swiss rival Trafigura , and about half that of Vitol, the world’s largest oil trader.</P><P>“She has always had the dream of building a first-class oil trader,” said the former senior Chinaoil trader.</P><P>“We were constantly asked to draw comparisons with international oil majors like BP and Shell and leading western trading houses like Vitol and Glencore, for turnover and profit,” said a third source, also a former Chinaoil trader.</P><P>Wang joined Chinaoil as a vice president in 1995. She was a planning official at CNPC before that and an early advocate of breaking up China’s oil trading monopoly held by Sinochem. That eventually led to the creation of Chinaoil and Unipec, the trading arm of China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corp., known as Sinopec.</P><P>Having started as a marketer of crude oil to Japan, Chinaoil expanded into the import business by bringing the first foreign oil cargo to China of Vietnamese crude in 1996.</P><P>Wang was the mastermind behind Chinaoil buying stakes in Japan’s Osaka refinery, Singapore Petroleum Co and INEOS’ plants in Scotland and France.</P><P>“She’s grown Chinaoil into a hybrid of state oil trader with the asset spread of a global major and trading strategy of a western trading house,” said the first former Chinaoil trader.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""panel-pane pane-block pane-scmp-newsletter-node-newsletter-subscription-form pos-1""><DIV class=""pane-content""><DIV class=""row scmp-newsletter-subscribe""><FORM class=""hidden scmp-newsletter-subscription-form newsletter-20916 "" data-newsletter-name=""SCMP Today: HK Edition"" data-newsletter-tid=""20916"" action=""https://www.scmp.com/api/rest/public/v2/newsletter/subscribe.json"" method=""POST"" id=""scmp-newsletter-subscription-form-20916"" accept-charset=""UTF-8""><DIV class=""inner-wrap""><DIV class=""subscribe-wrap""><DIV class=""col-lg-6 col-md-12 newsletter-description""><DIV class=""name"">SCMP Today: HK Edition</DIV><DIV class=""spiel"">Get updates direct to your inbox</DIV></DIV><DIV class=""col-lg-6 col-md-12 form-input-wrap""><DIV class=""form-item form-type-textfield form-item-mail""><LABEL class=""element-invisible"" for=""edit-mail"">E-mail <SPAN class=""form-required"" title=""This field is required."">*</SPAN></LABEL></DIV><DIV class=""privacy-policy"">

From a quick glance at the headlines, it’s clear that things are moving fast.</P><P><A href=""http://www.cp.ethz.ch/research/edc.html"">De<mark>carbon</mark>isation of electricity generation</A>, the largest contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, is still in its early stages, but is picking up pace as adoption of renewable sources of energy – particularly wind and solar – becomes widespread. De<mark>carbon</mark>isation of <A href=""http://www.scmp.com/topics/future-transport"">transport</A> – by phasing out fossil-fuel burning vehicles – has just begun, but recent advances in <A href=""http://www.scmp.com/tech"">technologies</A> and announcements by <A href=""http://www.scmp.com/news/china"">China</A>, <A href=""http://www.scmp.com/topics/india"">India</A> and <A href=""http://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe"">European</A> countries on national goals for electric vehicles indicate that this challenge could soon be addressed on a large scale.</P><P>Less discussed is another huge contribution the energy sector could make to <mark>climate</mark> mitigation: getting methane out of energy production and use. While <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide is a much longer-lasting greenhouse gas – with a life cycle of centuries, compared to roughly 10 years for methane – methane is more than 80 times as potent, and makes up <A href=""http://archive.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/environment/environmental-reporting-series/environmental-indicators/Home/Atmosphere-and-<mark>climate</mark>/global-greenhouse-gases.aspx"">16 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions</A>.</P><P>Natural gas is made up mostly of methane. At many points of the life cycle of gas, methane makes its way into the atmosphere – from extraction at a gas field all the way to the heating systems many of us have in our homes.</P><P>Natural gas is often referred to as a “transition fuel” – both because of the role it is able play in balancing wind and solar energy in electricity grids, and the assumption that its use will eventually decline as the world moves toward a low-<mark>carbon</mark> energy sector. It is entirely possible that, in electricity generation, renewable energy sources – backed up by batteries – may take natural gas’ share in the coming years if costs come down further.</P><H5>How China’s highly polluting clothing industry is going green</H5><H4><EM><A href=""http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2129895/smart-money-food-safety-health-care-clean-energy-china-year-say"">The smart money is on food safety, health care, clean energy in China this year, say experts</A></EM></H4><P>However, power generation only makes up 18.5 per cent of world energy consumption and <A href=""https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data"">25 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions</A>. There is currently no easy replacement for fossil fuels in many industrial processes or in large-scale heat generation. Industry alone is responsible for <A href=""https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data#Sector"">21 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions</A>. In these areas, gas is likely to be with us for some years to come.</P><P>This may seem like a mere technical issue, but getting methane out of the natural gas equation could be a huge win for the fight against <mark>climate change</mark>. This is especially true in developing and middle-income countries, where <A href=""http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/wolfram/papers/JEP%20NBER%202.pdf"">80 per cent of projected growth</A> in demand for gas will take place. The International Energy Agency <A href=""https://www.iea.org/newsroom/news/2017/october/commentary-the-environmental-case-for-natural-gas.html"">recently estimated</A> the emissions savings of putting serious methane reduction measures in place as equivalent to shutting down all the coal plants in China. Given its potential impact in the short to medium term, it is hard to see how we get to the <A href=""http://www.scmp.com/topics/paris-<mark>climate</mark>-summit-2015"">Paris Agreement</A> goal of keeping global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius without cleaning up natural gas.</P><H4><EM><A href=""http://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/2128104/there-tipping-point-un-warns-<mark>climate</mark>-change-goals"">‘There is a tipping point’: UN warns <mark>climate change</mark> goals laid out in Paris accord are almost out of reach</A></EM></H4><P>This is not going to be easy – methane is released at many stages of gas extraction, transport and production – from flaring at the wellhead to difficult-to-avoid leaks along long pipelines, to inefficient combustion in industrial plants and electricity generation. The good news is that the industry is very aware of the issue and is taking action – as individual companies and as a whole.</P><P>Last November, international gas companies gathered in London to work out a set of guiding principles to reduce methane emissions across the gas life cycle for the industry as a whole. For these companies, backing up gas’ reputation as the cleanest fossil fuel is going to require real, measurable reductions in methane emissions.</P><P>But the global gas industry cannot tackle this challenge alone. Emerging economies and developing countries, plus governments and national oil companies, need to do much of the heavy lifting. This requires long-term policy efforts and credible monitoring and reporting systems.</P><P>Success also requires sustained advocacy and campaigning by global civil society organisations that realise, no matter their position on natural gas, methane abatement has a huge <mark>climate</mark> upside. Experts and institutions also need to be involved to verify results and ensure the latest thinking and technologies are being brought to bear.</P><H5>Alessandro Bisagni picks up the pace as the clock ticks down on <mark>climate change</mark></H5><H4><EM><A href=""http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2125896/big-black-hole-chinas-<mark>carbon</mark>-market-ambitions"">Will China’s <mark>carbon</mark> trading scheme work without an emissions cap?</A></EM></H4><P>Some <mark>climate</mark> challenges are harder than others. Without making light of the technical issues involved, this is a success waiting to happen. The key players are ready to act, and groups normally at odds have a shared interest in addressing this problem. The technologies are in place, and the costs are not prohibitive. A successful campaign could also demonstrate ways that methane could be reduced in other sectors where it is a major contributor to anthropogenic global warming – such as <A href=""http://www.scmp.com/topics/food-and-agriculture"">agriculture</A> and waste management.</P><P>Such a global coalition to get methane out of energy production and consumption could, in a relatively short time, have a huge impact and make a tremendous contribution to tackling the overriding issue of our time.</P><P><STRONG>Riccardo Puliti is the senior director for energy and extractives at the World Bank</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""panel-pane pane-block pane-scmp-newsletter-node-newsletter-subscription-form pos-1""><DIV class=""pane-content""><DIV class=""row scmp-newsletter-subscribe""><FORM class=""hidden scmp-newsletter-subscription-form newsletter-323850 "" data-newsletter-name=""Opinion"" data-newsletter-tid=""323850"" action=""https://www.scmp.com/api/rest/public/v2/newsletter/subscribe.json"" method=""POST"" id=""scmp-newsletter-subscription-form-323850"" accept-charset=""UTF-8""><DIV class=""inner-wrap""><DIV class=""subscribe-wrap""><DIV class=""col-lg-6 col-md-12 newsletter-description""><DIV class=""name"">Opinion</DIV><DIV class=""spiel"">Get updates direct to your inbox</DIV></DIV><DIV class=""col-lg-6 col-md-12 form-input-wrap""><DIV class=""form-item form-type-textfield form-item-mail""><LABEL class=""element-invisible"" for=""edit-mail"">E-mail <SPAN class=""form-required"" title=""This field is required."">*</SPAN></LABEL></DIV><DIV class=""privacy-policy"">

By 
<A href=""http://www.sfexaminer.com/author/robyn-purchia/"" title=""Posts by Robyn Purchia"" class=""author url fn"" rel=""author"">Robyn Purchia</A> on December 21, 2016 1:00 am</DIV><P>’Tis the season to eat, drink and be merry, and San Francisco’s restaurants are a great place to do all three. Amidst white tablecloths and the sound of cocktail shakers, the winter cold may seem far away. But each bite of warm bread and sip of wine connects patrons to the world outside their cozy booth — a world increasingly impacted by <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>Crops and livestock suffer from extreme and chaotic weather, which is already causing food to become scarcer and more expensive. The environment also suffers as our demands increase. Food must move beyond these roles of environmental victim and perpetrator. Thankfully, in The City, some big names in the restaurant industry are moving food toward a <mark>climate change</mark> solution.</P><P>“There is the possibility to make a lot of difference with menu choice,” Anthony Myint, a San Francisco restaurateur who champions environmental sustainability, told me.  </P><P>His menu at The Perennial in SoMa is an example. It offers warm slices of crunchy Kernza bread, a grain that draws <mark>carbon</mark> out of the air and stores it in the ground. Organic beef comes from Stemple Creek Ranch, which uses compost to enhance <mark>carbon</mark> sequestration. These ingredients not only reduce The Perennial’s <mark>carbon</mark> footprint, they also work to slow <mark>climate change</mark>. They demonstrate food as an environmental solution.</P><P>The optimistic, environmental ethos behind The Perennial is certainly commendable. But it’s unrealistic to expect every restaurant to adopt the same comprehensive approach — at least, immediately.</P><P>Myint, along with Chris Ying of Lucky Peach and <mark>carbon</mark> emissions expert Peter Freed, developed another way for more mainstream restaurants to make a difference. Their nonprofit, Zero Foodprint, helps restaurants calculate their <mark>carbon</mark> footprint and figure out practical ways to reduce it. Participating restaurants usually purchase <mark>carbon</mark> credits to offset their operational emissions.</P><P>“The purchase of <mark>carbon</mark> credits, in general, supports projects that verifiably reduce emissions,” Elizabeth Singleton, executive director of Zero Foodprint, told me. “At the end of the day, what we’re talking about is the true cost of food. We’re trying to price <mark>carbon</mark> back into food.”</P><P>The prices on Mission Chinese Food’s menu reflect that cost. Zero Foodprint found the restaurant’s ingredients accounted for 78 percent of its <mark>carbon</mark> footprint. Among the ingredients, beef and lamb were the biggest offenders. Mission Chinese Food raised the price of these dishes by a dollar to account for their <mark>carbon</mark> cost. The small price hike went to purchasing <mark>carbon</mark> credits and more <mark>sustainable</mark> ingredients. </P><P>But the price hike does more than just account for the true cost of beef and lamb — it has an affect on people who eat at the restaurant. Like a <mark>carbon</mark> tax, it gently guides cost-conscious people to make better choices while ordering. It subtly raises awareness among those raising their Tsingtao beers and chowing down on Mission Chinese Food’s deliciously spicy dishes. It inspires change.</P><P>“The most impactful [way to lead change] is helping get the word out there, talking about it,” said Chef Corey Lee of San Francisco’s acclaimed <mark>Michelin</mark>-star restaurant, Benu. </P><P>Zero Foodprint just completed a <mark>carbon</mark> assessment at Benu and is completing assessments at Chef Lee’s other restaurants, Monsieur Benjamin in Hayes Valley and In Situ in SFMOMA.</P><P>The collaboration between Zero Foodprint and Chef Lee will hopefully get more chefs involved. Not only is Chef Lee renowned in the industry, he also works with the chefs who feature dishes at In Situ. He can encourage them to reduce the impact of their ingredients by using different suppliers, purchasing <mark>carbon</mark> credits and including price hikes that will reach more customers. </P><P>These chefs and restaurateurs are in a unique position to move food toward a <mark>climate change</mark> solution. Of course, the government could impose a hamburger tax, and grassroots groups and religious organizations could boycott. But relying on restaurants to lead makes the most sense: Not only do they know food, they also know how much we love it.<EM>

Musing on the “terrible news” that the concentration of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere recently passed 400 parts per million, a level that augurs further rapid <mark>climate change</mark>, Thompson concluded that humans will ultimately have to “invent our way out” of the crisis.</P></DIV><DIV class=""tablet-ad""><SPAN class=""adv""> Advertisement </SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""text text-6 parbase section""><P>Given humanity’s proven ability to master new technologies, such faith is not unreasonable. Over the last two centuries, we have harnessed electricity and nuclear power, revolutionized the speed at which we travel, entirely rethought how we share and manipulate information, and learned to engineer the basic materials of life.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-7 section""><P>The question we should be asking, however, is not whether we have the technical smarts to ensure we all have enough to eat. It’s whether we have the political smarts to protect those among us—the scientists and engineers and entrepreneurs—who will think up the better ideas and better ways and put them to use.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-8 section""><P>The fundamental danger we face is simple. In recent years a few private companies have captured almost complete control over many vital technological realms, and the managers of many of these firms increasingly have an incentive to manipulate technological advancement in a way that serves their private interests only. As a result we find our society directed down fewer and fewer technological pathways, hence toward fewer and fewer potential futures.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-9 section""><P>In the late 19<SUP>th</SUP> century, when Americans first came face to face with immense private monopoly, it was easy to see how giants could block alternative pathways to a market. When independent oil drillers in Pennsylvania tried to build a pipeline to the coast, for instance, Standard Oil bought up long strips of land—often called “dead lines”—to cut them off.</P></DIV><DIV class=""tablet-ad""><SPAN class=""adv""> Advertisement </SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-10 section""><P>Nowadays most such battles take place in more virtual realms. In the pharmaceutical industry, <A href=""http://www.uspirg.org/sites/pirg/files/reports/Top_Twenty_Pay_For_Delay_Drugs_USPIRG.pdf"">GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer</A> routinely pay rivals not to manufacture generic versions of profitable drugs. In semiconductors, trustbusters in Europe, Japan, and South Korea all concluded in recent years that Intel was using secret arrangements to prevent its customers from buying from competitors. In software, the fashion today is simply to buy up one’s rivals; <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/22/technology/22oracle.html?_r=0"">Oracle</A> has purchased more than <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acquisitions_by_Oracle"">70</A> competitors just since 2005.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text-11 text parbase section""><P>Nowhere do we see so many “dead lines” cutting across our future than in agriculture and food.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text-12 text parbase section""><P>By now most of us know the chemical company Monsanto dominates immense swaths of the seed business, with its genetic traits in some 90 percent of our soybean crop and 80 percent of our corn. Less well-known is that <A href=""http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/monsanto-reaches-another-cross-licensing-pact-with-a-rival/article_ec7b071a-797a-54ed-8114-5170b138edce.html"">Monsanto</A> buttresses this awesome control through cross-licensing arrangements that, as a Food &amp; Water Watch <A href=""http://documents.foodandwaterwatch.org/doc/Antitrust-Seeds-web.pdf"">report</A> details, intimately interweave its interests with its “rivals,” as it did with DuPont last March. The practical result? Where many thousands of farmers, small seed companies, and university scientists once worked to develop stronger seeds, we see but a handful of giants. And because these firms now share the profits of most <mark>innovation</mark>s, they have less real incentive on any given day to risk investing in what is new.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text-13 text parbase section""><P>Much the same is true among the giant corporations that butcher and package our cows, hogs, and chickens. In the past <A href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/food/2013/06/shuanghui_s_smithfield_takeover_what_the_planned_buyout_means_for_american.html"">Smithfield</A> and other giant processors merely enjoyed power over the farmer and consumer. Now they also rule over the genetic material of the animals themselves, which they claim is a form of “intellectual property,” as they noted in <A href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/07/10/senate-smithfield-ceo-defends-merger/2505699/"">congressional hearings</A> earlier this month. Their power is so complete that the companies that trade in animals bred through traditional, open methods—like <A href=""http://www.gourmet.com/foodpolitics/2009/01/politics-of-the-plate-niman-ranch-crisis"">Niman Ranch</A>—find it ever harder to survive.</P></DIV><DIV class=""tablet-ad""><SPAN class=""adv""> Advertisement </SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""text text-14 parbase section""><P>The swelling power of the trading companies that collect the grains of the farmer and distribute food to the citizen further speed such technological pruning and intellectual simplification. When giant grain-trading companies buy up traditional transport and storage facilities, as ADM is now doing with <A href=""http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/companies/heffernan-keeps-digging-but-graincorp-chief-stands-her-ground-on-adm-offer/story-fn91v9q3-1226680408077"">GrainCorp</A>, higher transport and storage fees can threaten smaller farmers, along with their accumulated knowledge of seed, soils, and <mark>climate</mark>s. When Wal-Mart cuts what it pays its suppliers, those suppliers often respond, as Charles Fishman detailed in <EM><A href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143038788/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0143038788&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=slatmaga-20"">The Wal-Mart Effect</A></EM>, by cutting quality, variety, and what they invest in new and better products. They also often respond by merging with one another, which means both fewer pathways to the market and less competitive pressure to introduce and test new ideas.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text text-15 parbase section""><P>The effects of such gigantism on technological advance can last a long time. The Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter in 1942 famously wrote of how the fear of “potential competition” can keep even a complete monopolist on its toes. But in the real world, such “potential” is realized only rarely. Instead, we see processes and products that remain the same over very long periods of time, as the companies that control these systems choose to invest instead in buying up and blocking off what is new, even if better.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-16 section""><P>In the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century, both Democrats and Republicans routinely used antitrust law to drive competition in some of our most important technological realms—including electronics and communications. The result was a series of fantastic technological advances. Yet the trustbusters did not always succeed. In 1911 they lost a case against U.S. Steel. Seventy-five years later, that company still relied on the same old furnaces even as foreign companies in more competitive markets developed vastly superior technologies. In 1926 the trustbusters failed to force GE to open up the light bulb market. As a result, we continued to use notoriously wasteful 19<SUP>th</SUP>-century tungsten filament technology well into the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-17 section""><P>Before we can ever effectively address concentration and its effects on technological advance—and the chance to create a better, perhaps <mark>sustainable</mark> world—we must first overcome the widespread misapprehension that competition is wasteful, hence that in regulating our political economy we must aim foremost at efficiency.</P></DIV><DIV class=""tablet-ad""><SPAN class=""adv""> Advertisement </SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-18 section""><P>The idea is not a new. In America we can trace the idea to men like John. D. Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan, who justified their predations in large part by claiming they were making business more “efficient.” Such thinking was soon adopted—and formalized—by many economists and other “experts.” A century ago in America, many promoters of “scientific management” of production truly believed there was a “one best way” to accomplish every task.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-19 section""><P>But the idea did not win wide acceptance. Classic liberals like Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Dwight Eisenhower believed strongly in the need to promote competition through the distribution of power—for both political and economic reasons. One practical result was very <A href=""http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/july_august_2013/features/estates_of_mind045639.php?page=all"">rapid technological advance</A> in those sectors where antitrust was enforced. For instance, the great industrial historian Alfred Chandler concluded that it was the trustbusters who “set the stage” for the Silicon Valley scientists who invented the “electronic century.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase section text-20""><P>In the 1960s, however, the idea of efficiency surged back into fashion on both wings of the political spectrum, especially among followers of leftist economist John Kenneth Galbraith and the right-wing “Chicago school” of economics. The argument was essentially the same one put forward by Rockefeller a century earlier: The bigger a firm, the greater its ability to drive down prices and serve the “consumer.” But this time, with the backing of the “consumer movement” forged in the 1960s, the advocates of efficiency at last achieved the revolutionary change they sought. The key to their political victories? The argument that enforcement of antitrust law should be oriented around a new concept—that of “consumer welfare.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-21 section""><P>In the three decades since the “consumer welfare” test was built into our anti-monopoly laws, Americans have witnessed perhaps the greatest roll-up of power ever, one that has remade almost every sector of the U.S. economy. And the basic thinking remains largely unchanged, even after the Wall Street crash of 2008 revealed some of the structural dangers posed by concentration and even after the Tea Party and Occupy movements proved that Americans still very much fear monopoly. The idea that government should help private actors to impose “efficiency” in business and banking—supposedly to help the “consumer”—still shapes decision-making by the Obama administration, Congress, and the Federal Reserve.</P></DIV><DIV class=""tablet-ad""><SPAN class=""adv""> Advertisement </SPAN></DIV><DIV class=""text-22 text parbase section""><P>Strangely, one of the strongest bastions of support for this “consumer welfare” argument is the environmental movement. Here the origins of the idea that competition is “wasteful” trace largely to Theodore Roosevelt-era thinking on “conservation.” But the practical result is the same, as we can see when groups like the Environmental Defense Fund and Natural Resources Defense Council embrace Wal-Mart and other goliaths precisely because they believe they can “create environmental progress by leveraging corporate purchasing power.”</P></DIV><DIV class=""text text-23 parbase section""><P>In 1798 the British economist Thomas Malthus published “An Essay on the Principle of Population.” His argument was simple. The limited amount of land in the world meant a limited amount of food, hence a limit to the total number of people. If the population grew beyond this limit, starvation would soon bring the numbers back into balance. For decades, right through human catastrophes like the Irish Potato Famine, the rulers of Europe used Malthus’ zero-sum argument as an excuse to do nothing.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text-24 text parbase section""><P>Yet across the Atlantic, the American people were already proving Malthus wrong. Having broken the power of the lords and clerics who for so long ruled over our land and industry and minds, Americans now took advantage of our new freedom to think up better ways to reap and sow and improve our seeds. And so, long before gasoline-powered tractors, petroleum-based fertilizers, and genetic manipulation of plant matter, American farmers adapted plants like wheat and corn to entirely new ranges and greatly increased per-acre yields.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text-25 text parbase section""><P>We stand today, as a society, armed with innumerable better ideas. They include, as Michael Pollan <A href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2013/07/michael_pollan_on_agriculture_s_role_in_fighting_<mark>climate</mark>_change.html"">told <STRONG><EM>Slate</EM></STRONG>recently</A>, farming techniques that empower us simultaneously to address “<mark>climate change</mark> <EM>and</EM> soil quality <EM>and</EM> food security.” This includes, as <A href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2013/07/open_source_gmos_to_fight_<mark>climate</mark>_change_and_take_down_monsanto.html"">Frederick Kaufman wrote</A>, “open source” approaches to improving foods that empower many scientists to participate in projects where one or a few corporate teams now rule. It is impossible, today, to know which ideas will best enable us to adapt our food system to a world of rapid, even chaotic environmental change. What we do know is the best way to sort through these ideas is within transparent and competitive marketplaces.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-26 section""><P>The American food movement has achieved much success in developing new models of farming, and in creating markets and regional networks that connect growers to eaters. But the movement can never win the big fight—to apply these principles to the systems that feed all the people of the world—until it stands up squarely to the command-and-control corporate systems that increasingly dominate our political economy, and to the arguments used to justify that power.</P></DIV><DIV class=""text parbase text-27 section""><P>If we find ourselves living in a new era of food shortages, it will not be due only to our failure to control <mark>carbon</mark>. It will be due even more to our failure to protect the open-market systems that empower us not merely to exchange, but to think and adapt.</P></DIV></DIV></SECTION></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1.0,1.0,Positive

Shortly after, an international study concluded that extreme weather conditions constitute a threat to the reindeer herding culture of the Nenets people living in the Yamal Peninsula in Siberia.</P><P>“Reindeer herding cultures have been able to adapt to climatic, social and economic changes. Despite the challenges, I believe there is a future for reindeer herding,” says Associate Professor <STRONG>Timo Kumpula</STRONG>.</P><P>For several years, he’s been a member of an international research group studying the reindeer herding culture of the Yamal-Nenets people. Kumpula has also carried out extensive research into reindeer herding issues in Finland.</P><P>“For a geographer, reindeer pastures constitute an interesting topic of research. We can look at reindeer pastures from the viewpoint of lichen and draw conclusions based on that. However, reindeer husbandry is a socio-ecological system, and this makes over-grazing a difficult question, for example.”</P><P>Possible over-grazing by reindeer has been a topic of discussion in Finland and the Yamal Peninsula alike. It has been speculated that overly large reindeer flocks caused the outbreak of an anthrax epidemic in the Yamal Peninsula in spring 2016. However, another and more likely possible culprit could be the exceptionally warm summer.</P><P>“The Yamal Peninsula suffered a major anthrax epidemic in the 1940s, and dead animals were buried deep in the permafrost. Due to last summer's exceptional warmth, the active soil layer melted deeper than before, and it is suspected that this melting caused the release of anthrax pathogens.”</P><P>What does the discussion on reindeer over-grazing in Finland focus on? Several studies have established that the amount of lichen is considerably smaller in the northernmost parts of Finland than across the border in Norway. There is a reindeer fence on the Finnish-Norwegian border, preventing reindeer from moving between the two countries.</P><P>“A simple explanation is that the areas by the border on the Norwegian side are winter pastures, with reindeer grazing there only in late winter.”</P><P>On the Finnish side of the border, on the other hand, the lichen areas are summer pastures, resulting in lichen trampling and lower coverage. According to Kumpula, pasture rotation could be one solution.</P><P>“In some districts, reindeer herders practise pasture rotation, keeping winter and summer pastures separate. This prevents reindeer from trampling on fragile lichen in the summer.”</P><P>In Finland, however, the system of several reindeer owners’ associations makes pasture rotation difficult: there are 54 separate owners’ associations, each of them an independent regional administrative unit. For these associations, increasing pasture rotation would mean an increased amount of work and costs, as reindeer would have to be more intensively herded from one pasture to the next.</P><P>“Practices vary between associations. Some of them gather their reindeer inside fences for the winter and feed them there. However, there are also associations that let their reindeer graze freely, without any additional food.”</P><P>Another thing that has been totally missed in the recent over-grazing discussion is the impact of other land use on lichen pastures.  </P><P>“Most herding districts have suffered from heavy forestry, and old forests with arboreal lichens have disappeared. Arboreal lichen growing on old trees has constituted very important winter fodder for reindeer. Now that it’s gone, supplementary feeding is of course needed, and there is greater pressure on remaining ground lichen pastures.”</P><P>Lichen is only one indicator used in analysing the condition of pastures. Preliminary research findings suggest that reindeer also play a significant role in preventing the growth of shrubs in fell areas.</P><P>Kumpula and researcher <STRONG>Teemu Tahvanainen </STRONG>have studied the effects of reindeer pasturage on ground vegetation in the operating area of the Näkkälä reindeer owners’ association in Enontekiö, Finnish Lapland. In the early 2000s, 15 experimental fences were set up, and the preliminary findings suggest that reindeer help in keeping fell vegetation at bay.</P><P>“In the experimental areas, willows have started to gain length. In Norway, shrub vegetation was higher in the fell areas, possibly contributing to the fact that snow melts away sooner there. This, in turn, affects global warming.”</P><P>Global warming constitutes a challenge for the traditional reindeer herding culture of the Nenets people in the Yamal Peninsula in particular. In winter 2013–2014, exceptionally large areas used for reindeer pasturing froze after heavy rain, resulting in the death of more than 60,000 reindeer.</P><P>The pasture areas froze because of exceptionally low ice coverage in the Barents Sea and the Kara Sea, and that brought humid air masses to land and caused rain on snow.</P><P>“If the sea remains open longer and more often, these kinds of climatic phenomena will become increasingly frequent. Pasture freezing is more common towards the west, but <mark>climate change</mark> is moving the boundary of unsettled weather conditions increasingly eastwards,” Kumpula says.</P><P>In Fennoscandia, pasture freezing is not that significant a problem for reindeer herding, as there is a possibility to provide reindeer with additional food.</P><P>“In the Yamal Peninsula, however, providing additional food is not a possibility, as the area doesn’t have fields or an extensive road infrastructure. If widespread pasture freezing becomes common in the Yamal Peninsula, making additional food available to reindeer could be a solution for preventing large-scale reindeer deaths.”</P><P>However, if reindeer herders continue to struggle with <mark>climate</mark>-related problems, the traditional livelihood may lose its appeal among the younger generations.</P><P>“So far, the younger generations have wanted to continue reindeer herding and living on the tundra.”</P><P>The study on the effects of pasture freezing on reindeer husbandry in the Yamal Peninsula was published in Biology Letters in November 2016. The study constituted part of a series of studies led by the Arctic Centre of the University of Lapland, with the University of Eastern Finland participating in them.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""footerwrapper""><DIV class=""socialwrapper""><DIV class=""social""><SPAN class=""soclabel"">Follow UEF:</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,0.0,Neutral

An urgent solution is needed for <A href=""http://www.cargill.com/foodsecureworld/"" target=""_blank"">how we will feed 9.5 billion</A> people by 2050 in a changing <mark>climate</mark> that is altering how we grow our food.</P><P>This promises to be a daunting exercise. Global warming could have the most serious impact on the parts of the world where populations are growing the fastest. Most of the planet’s remaining arable land is in Africa, a continent that is rich in growth and promise, but, for now, still poor in income and infrastructure.</P><P>One can’t help but wonder how we’ll come up with enough food for all.</P><P>These worries are not new. The world’s population grew from 1.5 billion in 1900 to 2.5 billion in 1950. Then, too, many feared that agricultural output couldn’t keep up. As late as the 1960s, people warned of a ticking “population bomb.” Yet, the “Green Revolution” in agriculture delivered new techniques and scientific approaches to growing food. In the last 40 years, we were able to double agricultural output without taking much new land into production.</P><P>We at Cargill believe the world can do that again. But it won’t just happen by itself. Just as we did in the second half of the 20th century, we have to keep innovating and using science and technology to get the most out of every acre. We have to build the infrastructure in the developing world to make that happen.</P><P>The complicating factor, compared to the 20th century, is <mark>climate change</mark>. We don’t know the full consequences global warming will have, but we do know that we are beginning to see them today. One in 100- and 1,000-year heat waves, droughts and floods are becoming routine. The planet is seeing months and years of record heat. According to NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2014 was the hottest year on record, and 2015 is on pace to be even hotter.</P><P>Evidently, we all need to do what we can to keep <mark>climate change</mark> in check. Cargill has been lowering its own greenhouse gas emissions steadily, and we’re taking measures to eliminate deforestation – a significant source of greenhouse gases – from our supply chains. But we also need to prepare ourselves for a more volatile world.</P><P>The solution is not to cut and run, with individual nations moving to protect their own populations with trade barriers and short-term advantage winning the day. We need to recognize our interdependence. If each country grows the crops it grows best and imports the ones it doesn’t, the total amount of available food will grow. If extreme weather wipes out harvests on one end of the globe, we need a global trade system that allows food to flow there freely from the other end.</P><P>That is by no means an easy task. In December, another U.N. <mark>Climate</mark> Summit will be held in Paris. We hope for the best, but we also know that past summits have shown how hard it is to rise above politics as usual and cooperate for substantial progress.</P><P>That’s why Cargill and its partners – the World Wildlife Fund, the Center for American Progress, the Center for Naval Analyses and Mars, Inc. – are organizing the <A href=""http://foodchainreaction.org/"" target=""_blank"">Food Chain Reaction</A> crisis simulation in Washington on November 9 and 10. We want to put real-life decision makers in the eye of the storm to see how they handle disruptions to the global food system and react to the consequences of their own decisions. We are optimistic that the world can rise to the challenge. The point now is to learn how to do it.</P><P><EM>Joe Stone is a corporate vice president of Cargill and a member of the company’s Sustainability Council.</EM></P></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1.0,2.0,Neutral

From Tsutsumi's viewing gantries, two production lines stretch away into the distance. These halls house the trim workshop. Here, completed body shells roll in, are divested of their doors (which make their way in pairs along a separate line) and the interior, hybrid system, dashboard and seats are installed. The factory, which has been making Priuses since 2003, produces 430,000 cars a year. From 6.30am to 1am, it can turn out a Prius every minute.</P><P class=""bb-p"">This is the Toyota Production System (TPS) at work, a fabled refinement that funnels the immense complexity of car-making into a series of simple stages. Each step is serviced using the just-in-time manufacturing process by the requisite parts supplier. The system is controlled by the workers themselves, who have autonomy over stopping and starting the line to resolve issues.</P><P class=""bb-p"">TPS is a mainstay of business-school case studies, as well as being widely imitated by envious rivals. The system is about efficiency in all its forms, from the constant tracking of components (<EM class=""bb-em"">kanban</EM>) to the fault-reporting system (<EM class=""bb-em"">andon</EM>), which dates back to Toyota Industries founder Sakichi Toyoda's early days making looms. The process of constant improvement is known as <EM class=""bb-em"">kaizen</EM>. Toyota has this down to a fine art, employing <EM class=""bb-em"">kaizen</EM> teams to roam the factory and scout for potential problems and possible efficiencies. On posters, shirts and tabards, the plant's official mascot - a cartoon horse called Tsutsuma-Kun - preaches health and safety.</P><ASIDE class=""ad__main is-hidden ad--article ad--article-rail ad--article-rail-top stick-wrapper ""><DIV class=""ad__block stick-element""><H5 class=""ad__title"">Advertisement</H5></DIV></ASIDE><P class=""bb-p"">In the adjoining building, stamped-steel Prius bodies are assembled robotically, using conventional welding and lasers (as well as a secret proprietary method that WIRED wasn't allowed to photograph). Today, the 1,850 robots at Tsutsumi are sourced from one of three main suppliers: Nachi, Yaskawa and Kawasaki. As the body shells roll into position, a cluster of around ten closely spaced robotic arms swivel and pivot in a synchronised dance that is simultaneously beguiling, awe-inspiring and terrifying. Then they all lurch forward at once, finding the pinch points where two pieces join, then dab and squeeze their welding pincers along the seams to seal them. Each stage takes just under a minute, before the arms retract and the line rolls on. Large components are sent straight to the line by a system of overhead wires and gravity-driven palettes. At the same time, a constant stream of electric trains bring the rest along a miniature road system of intersections and stop signs. The building is a chorus of whirring ratchets, beeping trucks, buzzing drills, the rattle of conveyor belts and pulleys and the hum of the air-conditioning.</P><P class=""bb-p"">The sheer volume of Priuses being built here speaks of its achievement. For two decades, no car has done more to alter the public perception of the hybrid automobile and to pave the way for electric vehicles. Black Priuses, thanks to Uber, have become ubiquitous on the streets of capital cities. They are verbal shorthand for generic, efficient, classless transportation. The Prius's job is, in many ways, complete. Toyota is now working on another vehicle - one that has the potential to change our relationship with cars all over again.</P><ASIDE class=""a-sidebar-content""><H4 class=""a-sidebar-content__title"">Read next</H4><UL class=""global__list-reset a-sidebar-content__list""><LI class=""a-sidebar-content__list-item""><ARTICLE class=""c-card c-card--portrait-small""><DIV class=""c-card__obj""><DIV class=""c-card__obj__body""><DIV class=""c-card__header""><H3 class=""c-card__title""><SPAN>The high-stakes race to stop the trafficking of priceless artefacts</SPAN></H3></DIV><DIV class=""c-card__footer""><P class=""c-card__byline""><SPAN class=""c-card__byline-prefix"">By</SPAN><SPAN class=""c-card__byline-name"">Karen Emslie</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></LI></UL></ASIDE><FIGURE class=""bb-figure  bb-figure--landscape  bb-figure--custom bb-figure--internal""><DIV class=""bb-figure__content""><FIGCAPTION class=""bb-figure__caption""><P class=""bb-p"">Takeshi Uchiyamada, chairman of the <mark>Toyota Motor Corpo</mark>ration</P></FIGCAPTION><DIV class=""bb-figure__credit"">Christoffer Rudquist</DIV></DIV></FIGURE><P class=""bb-p""><SPAN class=""bb-dropcap bb-dropcap--letter"">S</SPAN><STRONG class=""bb-strong"">hoichi Kaneko is deputy chief engineer on the</STRONG> fourth-generation Prius, which launched in 2016. Slight, spiky haired and nervous, he explains the new model's genesis, his enthusiasm growing as he does so. &quot;Generation-three Prius had a big role in getting hybrids known to the world. It sold very well, both in Japan and overseas,&quot; Kaneko says. &quot;Our goal for developing the fourth generation was to create the <EM class=""bb-em"">de facto</EM> standard of what we wanted from a hybrid car without sacrificing other qualities.&quot;</P><P class=""bb-p"">The latest Prius also has the most radical look yet. &quot;The first three generations had what we call a &quot;happy face&quot;, Kaneko explains. &quot;With the fourth generation, we tried to appeal to younger customers as well, so we changed the face to be more defiant.&quot;</P><ASIDE class=""ad__main is-hidden ad--article ad--article-inline  ""><DIV class=""ad__block ""><H5 class=""ad__title"">Advertisement</H5></DIV></ASIDE><P class=""bb-p"">Prius means &quot;superior&quot; in Latin. When the first generation arrived in the UK and US in 2000 it rapidly assumed cult status, earning celebrity endorsement from environmentally minded celebrities such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz and Larry David. The Prius benefited from California's progressive attitude on ultra-low-emission vehicles and eventually became the state's best-selling car. In Japan, however, the Prius sold well, but became increasingly associated with an ageing customer base. <mark>Innovation</mark> was swiftly subsumed by tradition. Hybrids, it turns out, weren't sexy. Toyota has attempted to back out of this branding cul-de-sac by focusing on technology, with the introduction of a more advanced plug-in hybrid version (PHV) in 2012.</P><P class=""bb-p"">On paper, the present-day Prius falls short of its rivals. Tesla has wrestled away its credentials as the car of choice for the conspicuously eco-conscious. Its range falls short of true electric rivals from Nissan, General Motors and others. &quot;We collected data from the first-generation car - Japanese motorists tend to only drive 20km a day,&quot; Kaneko says, in reference to the Prius PHV's electric-only range of 60km. Most PHV drivers used their cars as if they were fully electric, making short hops between charge points and rarely filling the tank.</P><ASIDE class=""a-sidebar-content""><H4 class=""a-sidebar-content__title"">Read next</H4><UL class=""global__list-reset a-sidebar-content__list""><LI class=""a-sidebar-content__list-item""><ARTICLE class=""c-card c-card--portrait-small""><DIV class=""c-card__obj""><DIV class=""c-card__obj__body""><DIV class=""c-card__header""><H3 class=""c-card__title""><SPAN>The struggle to turn psychedelics into life-changing treatments</SPAN></H3></DIV><DIV class=""c-card__footer""><P class=""c-card__byline""><SPAN class=""c-card__byline-prefix"">By</SPAN><SPAN class=""c-card__byline-name"">Nicola Davison</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></LI></UL></ASIDE><P class=""bb-p"">For the company that shaped a generation's attitude to petrol-powered cars, Toyota is reluctant to change too much too soon. &quot;Toyota sees that gasoline fuel has many years to go.

This innate caution goes hand-in-hand with Japan's susceptibility to extreme weather and natural disasters. &quot;Our different regions have a varied <mark>climate</mark>.

Car-making began in 1937, after a study of foreign models and methods. Today, Toyota is comprised of more than 12 sub-groups providing everything from steel components to air conditioners, forklift trucks and even houses.</P><P class=""bb-p"">The original Prius's development was fast and furious - very different from how the company had previously worked. The car's gestation is charted in Hideshi Itazaki's book <EM class=""bb-em"">The Prius that Shook the World</EM>, published in 1999. (The title is a nod to the 1990 bestseller <EM class=""bb-em"">The Machine That Changed the World</EM>, which introduced Toyota's lean-production concept.) Itazaki's book is written in the breathless style of the Japanese business novel, a hugely popular fiction genre that sidesteps Japan's traditionally deferential relationship between media and business by using corporate culture as a backdrop for action and romance. This telling of the Prius story does its best to bring drama to the banal. One passage reads: &quot;Shimatani-kun, I feel rather awkward, but would you help us out in the mass-production division? We need the diagonal-beam technology that you developed.&quot;</P><P class=""bb-p"">The Prius was the result of Toyota's G21 project, which was established in September 1993 to design a car for the next century. The man in charge of G21 was engineer Takeshi Uchiyamada, now chairman of the entire <mark>Toyota Motor Corpo</mark>ration. Today, Uchiyamada is sitting in a brown-tinged boardroom high up in Toyota's Nagoya HQ, joined by a translator and two PR people. Immaculately turned out in a white shirt and navy pinstripe suit with a red pocket, the grey-haired 71-year-old executive has been Toyota's chairman since 2013. A company lifer, he began his career in 1969 in computing and research, exploring ways of reducing vibration. His father, Kameo Uchiyamada, was also a chief engineer at the company.</P><ASIDE class=""a-sidebar-content""><H4 class=""a-sidebar-content__title"">Read next</H4><UL class=""global__list-reset a-sidebar-content__list""><LI class=""a-sidebar-content__list-item""><ARTICLE class=""c-card c-card--portrait-small""><DIV class=""c-card__obj""><DIV class=""c-card__obj__body""><DIV class=""c-card__header""><H3 class=""c-card__title""><SPAN>'Queen of Dragons': The inside story of Malaysia's election fixer</SPAN></H3></DIV><DIV class=""c-card__footer""><P class=""c-card__byline""><SPAN class=""c-card__byline-prefix"">By</SPAN><SPAN class=""c-card__byline-name"">Peter Guest</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></LI></UL></ASIDE><P class=""bb-p"">&quot;It was the first project that shared information over the internet.

Then, a year later, Uchimayada's new bosses decided to double it. (In the book, Uchimiyada calls the target outrageous.)

But the powertrain worked.</P><P class=""bb-p"">Uchiyamada wanted an open competition to design the Prius's body, but Toyota's management resisted the idea and an internal competition was held instead. The final design was by Irwin Liu at Calty, Toyota's Californian studio. The Prius MK 1 is prosaic in the extreme, but that didn't really matter: it was a car for motorists who care more about what cars mean, rather than how they look.</P><P class=""bb-p"">Uchiyamada says he immediately knew the Prius would be a success. &quot;Sales started in December 1997, two months after we first showed the car. We had five times the volume of orders than planned. Sales and marketing thought we'd sell 300 cars a month. We sold 1,000.&quot;</P><P class=""bb-p"">Through the TPS - relentlessly focusing on hundreds of small improvements in the production process - subsequent models performed better.

Every major car manufacturer either provides or promises a hybrid alternative. The VW emissions scandal has shaken the automotive world.

Although electric vehicles are becoming mainstream, many in the industry consider hydrogen to be the true successor to fossil fuels. Hydrogen is expensive and difficult to store, but it is clean. The chemical reaction in a fuel cell produces only water. It is also quick to refuel, unlike batteries. Japan has announced its intention to become the world's first hydrogen society. Toyota hopes that its new car, the Mirai, could end up being to hydrogen-fuel-cell vehicles what the Prius was to hybrids.</P><P class=""bb-p"">Mirai is a female Japanese name, meaning &quot;future&quot;. With a range of around 650km and a low centre of gravity, the Mirai drives and handles like a regular car. Its only emissions are water. Like the Prius, it's friendly looking; aesthetically safe, if not groundbreaking. (Anthropomorphism plays an important role in Japanese car culture, as Karasawa alluded - cars aren't as much signifiers of status, but objects of endearment.) Japan-only models have a plug in the boot that can supply up to 60kWh of electricity from the battery - or around a week's supply for the average family of four.</P><P class=""bb-p"">Mirai chief engineer Yoshikazu Tanaka says that the saloon car's design aims to make fuel-cell vehicles mainstream. &quot;To start the hydrogen society, we needed to sell an ordinary passenger car. So we developed the Mirai,&quot; he explains.</P><P class=""bb-p"">The Mirai is built at the LFA Works at Motomachi, near Nagoya. It is one of Toyota's most prestigious manufacturing centres, where workers are often sent by other factories to learn specific processes and become trainers and leaders. The Mirai line is similar to a supercar workshop, producing a maximum of 13 cars a day - 4,605 in total at the time of our visit (of which precisely 2,687 were built for export, mostly to California). Robots and heavy-lifting equipment are conspicuously absent, although the scanned and stacked supply system and jaunty-sounding <EM class=""bb-em"">andon</EM> boards are all present and correct. The main obstacle to speed, aside from the immature state of the hydrogen market itself, is the time and effort it takes to make the fuel-cell stack and hydrogen tanks. Tolerances are critical; hydrogen's volatility is greatly tempered by safe, pressurised storage and every set of twin tanks is tested with inert helium to ensure there are no leaks in the slim pipes feeding into the stack.</P><ASIDE class=""a-sidebar-content""><H4 class=""a-sidebar-content__title"">Read next</H4><UL class=""global__list-reset a-sidebar-content__list""><LI class=""a-sidebar-content__list-item""><ARTICLE class=""c-card c-card--portrait-small""><DIV class=""c-card__obj""><DIV class=""c-card__obj__body""><DIV class=""c-card__header""><H3 class=""c-card__title""><SPAN>The inside story of Jan Koum and how Facebook bought WhatsApp</SPAN></H3></DIV><DIV class=""c-card__footer""><P class=""c-card__byline""><SPAN class=""c-card__byline-prefix"">By</SPAN><SPAN class=""c-card__byline-name"">David Rowan</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></LI></UL></ASIDE><P class=""bb-p"">The thick-walled hydrogen tanks are spun from <mark>carbon</mark> fibre-reinforced thermoplastic (CFRP), an impact-resistant structure that is not only tested during assembly, but which has been designed to shut down its valves in the event of any impact or damage. Workers use Bluetooth torque wrenches that beam data into a central computer. This ensures that every bolt is tightened the requisite amount during installation, while piping is kept outside of the passenger cell and a thicket of sensors detects any leaks. &quot;It's improbable that the hydrogen would start a fire,&quot; plant manager Akifumi Karasawa says. He explains that US testers have to shoot tanks with firearms; the hydrogen evaporates through the bullet hole and rises to disperse in the atmosphere, rather than pooling at ground level the way petrol does.</P><FIGURE class=""bb-figure  bb-figure--landscape  bb-figure--custom bb-figure--internal""><DIV class=""bb-figure__content""><FIGCAPTION class=""bb-figure__caption""><P class=""bb-p"">Robot arms weld panels to create the Prius's body</P></FIGCAPTION><DIV class=""bb-figure__credit"">Christoffer Rudquist</DIV></DIV></FIGURE><P class=""bb-p""><SPAN class=""bb-dropcap bb-dropcap--letter"">T</SPAN><STRONG class=""bb-strong"">here's a crucial difference between the Prius and the Mirai:</STRONG> the absence of hydrogen infrastructure. Hydrogen production, transportation and bulk storage are still major challenges. The vast majority of hydrogen is generated using fossil fuels, which simply shifts C02 generation from tailpipe to production facility. And what the combination of fuel cell and electric motor make up in efficiency, they lose in density; you need more space for hydrogen storage compared to regular petrol or diesel, issues that increase dramatically when you consider tankers, pipelines and on-site storage. Hydrogen's proponents acknowledge the enormous costs involved in creating even a modest network; its critics dismiss it for all but the most specialist applications.</P><P class=""bb-p"">Building the Mirai illustrates the complexities involved. It takes about four days for the raw metal and components to be bolted together into a single car, which is about twice the length of time of a regular saloon. Making 2,000 Mirais a month requires intensive automation. The car is being &quot;productionised&quot; so that it can shift away from its meticulous workshops and on to the regular lines.</P><FIGURE class=""bb-figure  bb-figure--landscape  bb-figure--custom bb-figure--internal""><DIV class=""bb-figure__content""><FIGCAPTION class=""bb-figure__caption""><P class=""bb-p"">A Prius with Thermo-Tect paint, which boosts solar reflectivity</P></FIGCAPTION><DIV class=""bb-figure__credit"">Christoffer Rudquist</DIV></DIV></FIGURE><P class=""bb-p"">It's here that the TPS will be tested. The engineering challenges facing the Mirai are greater than those faced by Uchimayada's team when developing the Prius's hybrid engine. But, if the world is to embrace fuel-cell cars, the odds are that they won't be built by a boutique startup; economies of scale require scale. If any company can make hydrogen cars popular, it'll be the one that did so with hybrids, 20 years ago.</P><ASIDE class=""ad__main is-hidden ad--article ad--article-rail stick-wrapper ""><DIV class=""ad__block stick-element""><H5 class=""ad__title"">Advertisement</H5></DIV></ASIDE><P class=""bb-p"">Toyota's goal for the Mirai now is to increase production, starting with the second-generation model.

Enter the information <EM><STRONG>at least two weeks prior</STRONG></EM> to your event for best consideration. It may take up to a week to put it online, so please be patient. If you submit the event last minute, it unfortunately may not be published. If you submit multiple events not all may be published, but we try! Information must be entered in starred fields; others are optional. There is a limit of 250 characters in the text description. Please do not use exclamation points, or type in all capital letters. Remember to fill out the fields for date, time, and venue, if appropriate for your event. <EM><STRONG>Do not include prices, or any word related to cost, including the word 'free.' YOUR ANNOUNCEMENT MAY BE DECLINED if you include prices.</STRONG></EM> Write as if you were addressing a single person. All input is subject to approval and we reserve the right to edit any and all submissions. Please include the proper website, phone number or email address for people who want further information. If you have a question about your submission, please write <A href=""mailto:help@wmnf.org""> help@wmnf.org.</A>
WMNF reserves the right to publish, decline, or edit all Political Action submissions to protect our FCC &amp; Non-Profit status. All the other guidelines for submitting an event apply to Political Actions as well.

If this announcement is for a concert that’s not a benefit for a nonprofit organization, you can contact Laura Taylor to find out about being included on WMNF’s Concert Calendar, on-air and on our website. We have special rates for local bands: 
<A href=""mailto:laura@wmnf.org"">laura@wmnf.org</A> or 813-238-8001 x 132.  While we will post some concerts that are posted on the events page, for just a few dollars you can have your event highlighted, add a picture, and be in the concert calendar, which airs multiple times every week.
<STRONG>Community Announcement Guidelines</STRONG>
The Community Bulletin Board at WMNF is offered as a courtesy to non-profit organizations to broadcast events and fundraisers to listeners within the Tampa Bay region. For priority placement on the Community Bulletin Board, you must represent a 501(c)(3) or (4) IRS-designated organization. We will consider other arts and culture events offered free of charge to the public as space allows.

Sorry, WMNF does not do public service announcements for partisan political groups.
<STRONG>Record an announcement:</STRONG>
WMNF 88.5 FM invites nonprofit organizations to record a 30-second public service announcement for broadcast on 88.5. The guidelines are below.

The announcement must be for a registered nonprofit organization. Announcements are recorded with just voice, no music. A person from YOUR organization voices it. Since we’re non-commercial, announcements we can’t do a Call to Action for another organization. So you can’t say “come on down,” “don’t miss it,” “sign up now” or anything similar. But you can say, “You can go to (this website) for more information.” WMNF can’t announce prices, but you can direct people to a website or phone number for more information. And if it’s time-sensitive, we’d want to record that <EM><STRONG>at six weeks </STRONG></EM> before the date, so we have time to get things together and broadcast it for two weeks.

PSAs can be about what your group does and when you meet, or about a specific event you’re putting on. We’ll air one PSA at a time for each group, and the
station reserves the right to refuse announcements.

You can email a draft of your script to <A href=""mailto:nonprofitpsa@wmnf.org"">nonprofitpsa@wmnf.org</A> . Once your script is ready, we’ll find a good time for you or someone from your group to come to the station and record it.</LI><LI id=""field_5_1"" class=""gfield gfield_contains_required field_sublabel_below field_description_below gfield_visibility_visible""><LABEL class=""gfield_label gfield_label_before_complex"" for=""input_5_1_3"">Name<SPAN class=""gfield_required"">*</SPAN></LABEL></LI></FORM></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,0.0,

Photo by TheClimateGroup/Flickr</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><DIV class=""field field--body""><P>As 2017 begins, China is poised to leap ahead of the United States on clean energy to become the most important player in the global market. Last year, China increased its foreign investment in renewables by 60 percent to reach a record $32 billion, according to <A href=""http://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Chinas-Global-Renewable-Energy-Expansion_January-2017.pdf"">a new report</A> from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. This includes 11 new overseas investment deals worth more than $1 billion each.</P><P>China’s new Going Global strategy for renewable energy was an important instigator of its huge increase in foreign investment in 2016. This is part of a broader picture of overseas investment. Last year, China showed its regional strength by establishing the Asia Infrastructure &amp; Investment Bank and pouring money into the BRICS’ New Development Bank, which made its <A href=""http://ndb.int/brics-bank-gives-811-million-in-first-round-green-energy-loans.php"">first loans</A>, all for renewable energy.</P><H3>Renewables on the Rise</H3><P>Looking at the entire economy, not just foreign investment, China regularly outspends the United States on renewable energy. It invested more than <A href=""https://www.bnef.com/dataview/clean-energy-investment/index.html"">$100 billion</A> in clean energy in 2015, more than double U.S. investment, which spurred robust job growth. Of the 8.1 million <A href=""http://www.irena.org/menu/index.aspx?mnu=Subcat&amp;PriMenuID=36&amp;CatID=141&amp;SubcatID=2729"">renewable energy jobs</A> that exist globally, 3.5 million are in China, compared to less than one million in the United States. And China’s National Energy Administration <A href=""http://news.trust.org/item/20170105061200-0lnvd/"">projects</A> that new investment from 2016 to 2020 will create 13 million jobs in the renewable energy sector.</P><P>Solar panels are the mainstay of China’s clean energy sector. <A href=""http://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Chinas-Global-Renewable-Energy-Expansion_January-2017.pdf"">Five of the six</A> largest solar module manufacturing firms globally are Chinese. Average solar panel costs in China have tumbled about <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-26/china-to-cut-solar-wind-power-prices-as-project-costs-fall"">30 percent</A> this year.</P><P>But it’s not just solar. China is also embracing more complex manufacturing like electric cars. It overtook the United States as the largest market for electric vehicles in 2015, with over <A href=""https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/Global_EV_Outlook_2016.pdf"">200,000</A> new registrations. <A href=""http://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Chinas-Global-Renewable-Energy-Expansion_January-2017.pdf"">Two Chinese firms</A>, BYD and CATL, are challenging Tesla’s pre-eminence in the sector, and China’s Tainqi Lithium is now the world’s largest manufacturer of lithium ion, an important input for electric vehicle batteries.</P><P>Even with renewables on the rise, the percentage of coal in China’s energy mix remains quite high, contributing to climate change and choking smog in some of the largest Chinese cities. Electricity from coal often receives priority over renewable power, which means that some renewable energy capacity is being wasted. In the first half of 2016, 21 percent of wind power in China <A href=""https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.cspplaza.com/article-7705-1.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1483798850586000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHzW14jGRw73RaCTf4i84r51SQZxw"">went wasted</A> and 12.1 percent of solar in northern China was curtailed.</P><P>The good news is that the government is aware of these problems and is working to address them. It recently <A href=""http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2017-01/05/content_5156795.htm"">set a target</A> to limit coal at 58 percent of its energy mix by 2020, down from <A href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-energy-idUSKBN14H1EG"">64 percent in 2015</A>, and is working to reduce wasted renewable energy (learn more about these efforts <A href=""http://www.wri.org/blog/2016/04/chinas-1-2-3-punch-tackle-wasted-renewable-energy"">here</A>).</P><P>Looking at China’s latest five-year economic plan it is <A href=""http://newclimateeconomy.report/2016/a-roadmap-for-financing-sustainable-infrastructure/#section-3554-content-3573"">on pace to over-deliver</A> on its 2020 carbon intensity commitments. However, that’s not enough. All countries, including China, are falling short of the emissions cuts we need to avoid the most dangerous climate change. Everyone needs to go further.</P><P>Even though it is not going quite fast enough, China is heading in the right direction and is primed to become a clean energy superpower. By ramping up clean energy domestically, China is building the economies of scale it needs to export cost-competitive clean energy products and services abroad. The United States, on the other hand, could soon be moving in the opposite direction.</P><H3>Cooperation and Competition</H3><P>In the past, the U.S. has been quick to innovate and embrace new energy opportunities: it is a global leader in natural gas and was a pioneer of renewable energy technology. But as the clean energy market matures, the United States is ceding its leadership role to China. It’s time to catch up. U.S. states and cities are looking to a clean energy future. Public support is important at all levels, from investment in research and development to tax incentives for green investment. The rewards are immense, including new jobs and cheap, clean power. The U.S. solar industry is already creating jobs – well-paying, blue-collar construction and manufacturing jobs – <A href=""http://www.thesolarfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/TSF-2015-National-Solar-Jobs-Census.pdf"">12 times faster</A> than the overall economy.</P><P>It’s not all competition between the United States and China in the clean energy market. There is plenty of cooperation going on as well. These two giant economies are collaborating government-to-government with public-private partnerships, and many U.S. businesses are engaged with Chinese clean energy. For example, GE <A href=""http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2011-01/11/content_11825804.htm"">partnered</A> with State Grid Corp., one of China’s large electric utilities, to develop standards for smart grids in China. Goldwind, a Chinese wind turbine manufacturer, <A href=""http://www.goldwindglobal.com/web/news.do?action=detail&amp;id=201204160359131811"">developed and financed</A> a 20-megawatt wind farm in Montana, working with state representatives.</P><P>The United States is not out of the race yet, but if the trends continue, China will leave it behind. The U.S. economy stands to benefit from greater efforts. It cannot afford to miss the clean energy opportunity.  </P></DIV><DIV class=""field field--field-tags field--supplement""><LABEL class=""field__label"">Tags: </LABEL></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,0.0,Neutral

It was the first country to sign the United Nations Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (UNFCCC) that resulted from the 1992 Rio de Janeiro meeting, in June 1992. It ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2002 as a Non-Annex 1 Party, and was one of the first major developing countries to set a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target.</P><P>In November 2009, ahead of the UN’s COP15 meeting, the government pledged to reduce the country’s emissions by 36.1% to 38.9% in 2020. This target became <A class=""external-link"" href=""http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2007-2010/2010/Decreto/D7390.htm"">national law </A>in December 2010. Brazil has stressed that any mitigative measures are voluntary and achieving its target requires international financing. <mark>Climate</mark> Action Tracker has rated <A class=""external-link"" href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>actiontracker.org/country.php?id=2894"">Brazil's efforts </A>to achieve emissions reductions as ‘medium’.</P><P>As a result of various <mark>climate change</mark> programmes and initiatives, Brazil has a comparatively “clean” energy mix, with low GHG emission levels per energy unit produced or consumed. In 2009, around 84% of Brazil’s power was generated by hydroelectric plants. With the discovery of its extensive sub-salt oilfields, Brazil is close to becoming a major oil producer and exporter.</P><P><A class=""external-link"" href=""http://www.mma.gov.br/sitio/en/index.php?ido=ascom.noticiaMMA&amp;idEstrutura=8&amp;codigo=5329"">Government pledge press release, November 2009</A></P><P>Brazil has no ETS scheme, and a state-wide ETS for large emitters in Rio de Janeiro, expected in June 2012, has been delayed. Commentators believe other states may join the consultation process, leading to a national system covering the oil, steel, cement, ceramics, chemical, and petrochemical sectors. </P><P><EM>Emissions</EM></P><P>Brazil’s second national communication, submitted to the UNFCCC in 2010, provides the most recent emissions figures – from 2005 – when the country emitted an estimated 1638 teragrams (1638 million tonnes) of <mark>CO2</mark>. The land-use change and forestry sector contributed the most, at 77% of emissions, followed by the energy sector, which accounted for 19%. In the LUCF sector, 67% of emissions resulted from the Amazon region and 22% from the Cerrado. Within the energy sector, road transport contributed 39% and the industrial sub-sector 27%. Specific <mark>CO2</mark> emissions from the hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s sector were not itemised.</P><P>Download Brazil’s <A class=""external-link"" href=""http://www.mct.gov.br/index.php/content/view/326984.html"">second national communication </A>to the UNFCCC in 2010</P><H3>Issues and challenges</H3><P>Brazil is the largest country in South America. It has 186 million inhabitants and an average population growth of 1.15% per year. In 2008, 84.4% of the population lived in urban centres. Demand for electricity has been growing faster than production and the country’s economy, a trend expected to continue. The government has recognised the need for a new energy strategy, and emissions from coal are expected to increase due to the country's plans to install 6000MW of coal-fuelled power by 2030 (representing 2.7% of the national grid compared to 83% from renewables).</P><P>Brazil is the main exporter of several agricultural products – for example, coffee, tobacco and corn. It is one of the world’s largest manufacturers (cement, aluminum, chemicals, petrochemical feedstock) and is soon to become a major exporter of oil. All of these factors have implications for Brazil's efforts to reduce GHG emissions.</P><P>A significant proportion of the population still live in poverty and lack access to good healthcare, education and water. Therefore, national priorities are to meet these social and economic needs. However, the UNFCCC believes mitigation of and adaptation to <mark>climate change</mark> impacts is possible alongside these priorities.</P><P><EM>Impact of <mark>climate change</mark></EM></P><P>In 2007, the publication of the IPCC's <A class=""external-link"" href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_and_data_reports.shtml"">fourth assessment report </A>on <mark>climate change</mark> impacts sparked national concern. Preliminary results suggested a devastating potential impact on the natural environment and urban areas by 2100. A case study on the Amazon region, within the IPCC report, can be read <A class=""external-link"" href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch13s13-6.html"">here</A>.</P><P>In a worst case scenario, research by the National Institute for Space Research suggested the average temperature of the Amazon region could increase by 8C, leading to the loss of huge areas of the world's biggest rainforest. This would affect its capacity to absorb <mark>carbon</mark> as well as having a catastrophic effect on biodiversity and the rain cycle - which would also affect rainfall in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and South Africa. Other studies have suggested that 60% of rainforest could be lost by the end of this century if the average global temperature rises between 3C and 4C.</P><P>Rising sea levels would seriously damage the Brazilian coast, including homes and businesses, and the destruction of vital ports. There is also the potential for hurricanes to cause massive damage to cities that are home to around 25 million people. More frequent droughts and erratic weather systems would have an obvious impact on agriculture. <mark>Climate change</mark> is already being felt in the south, which has been hit in by droughts and intense storms in recent years.</P><P><A class=""external-link"" href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>changecorp.com/content.asp?ContentID=4816""><mark>Climate</mark>ChangeCorp article, March 2007</A></P><H3>Government commitments</H3><P>Brazil has established a <mark>Climate Change</mark> and Environmental Quality Secretariat responsible for <mark>climate change</mark> matters, as well as policies and instruments to regulate the <mark>carbon</mark> market. As a UNFCCC non-Annex I member, Brazil can access the Clean Development Mechanism.</P><P>Brazil’s GHG reduction targets announced before the UN’s COP15 meeting in 2009 – see above – led from a National Policy on <mark>Climate Change</mark> from the same year. The law behind the policy also included the Second Brazilian Inventory of Anthropogenic Emissions by Sources and Removals by Sinks of Greenhouse Gases not Controlled by the Montreal Protocol, a key part of Brazil's emissions monitoring and reporting.</P><P>In order to meet its targets, the country has set up initiatives in sectors such as agriculture and energy. The country has also set ambitious goals for reducing emissions from deforestation – the country's main source of GHG emissions.</P><P>Within the energy sector, Brazil is focusing on energy efficiency and the use of alternative sources of energy. Several programmes are under way to move towards lower emissions sources, such as natural gas. Since 1984, nuclear power has generated 152TWh of electricity. Renewable energy is expected to become a more significant source of energy, including 'modern' biomass, small hydro-electric plants, wind energy, solar energy, tidal power, and geothermal power. Other measures include integrating agricultural systems and an increase in energy supply from hydroelectric. A summary of Brazil’s mitigation actions, published by the UNFCCC in March 2011, can be read in more detail <A class=""external-link"" href=""http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2011/awglca14/eng/inf01.pdf"">here</A>.  </P><P>Brazil hopes to show its commitment to <mark>sustainable</mark> development and thereby attract international investment. Foreign investors have already taken note that Brazil has 13% of the UN's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects under way. More about the CDM <A class=""external-link"" href=""http://cdm.unfccc.int/about/index.html"">here</A>.</P><P>The government’s Ministry of Science and Technology is responsible for coordinating UNFCCC commitments. Its 2007-2010 Action Plan of Science, Technology and <mark>Innovation</mark> for National Development includes a National <mark>Climate Change</mark> Programme, which aims to increase technological capacity, identify <mark>climate change</mark> impact and guide public.</P><P>In 2000, the government set up the <A class=""external-link"" href=""http://www.iea.org/textbase/pm/?mode=cc&amp;id=3612&amp;action=detail"">Brazilian <mark>Climate Change</mark> Forum </A>as an arena for the exchange of ideas. It involves representatives from government, academia, NGOs and business but has no formal powers. It has no specific role in debating the use of CCS.</P><H3>CCS policy and legal frameworks</H3><P>The government has given its formal support, through the UNFCCC, for fast-tracking research into CCS technologies as well as the development and deployment of those already at demonstration phase. However, while acknowledging the role of CCS, it does not believe CCS should form part of the CDM framework.</P><P>Brazil does not have any specific policies or legislation to encourage the deployment of CCS technologies in Brazil. The IEA’s May 2011 review of CCS policy and legislation did not include a submission from Brazil.</P><P>State oil company <mark>Petrobras</mark> has been a long-term proponent of CCS and is leading the way in its R&amp;D and deployment (see below).</P><P>There is no federal policy of imposing charges for GHG emissions and, as of early 2009, there was no national emissions trading scheme. The Petroleum Law of 1997 includes the protection of the environment and requires the National Petroleum Agency to enforce environmental preservation actions.</P><P>With regards to infrastructure, the construction and operation of facilities related to oil and gas distribution are regulated by government, with the need for licensing by Brazil's environmental protection agency.</P><P>The rights of Brazil's indigenous peoples with regard to land and water are enshrined in the Brazilian Federal Constitution of 1988. Without specific CCS legislation in place, and with further legal requirements relating to environmental protection, the deployment of CCS could become complex unless there is full support from the federal government and public acceptance.</P><P>A detailed assessment of Brazil’s legislation with regard to the deployment of CCS – across the full chain – can be found in GCCSI’s <A class=""external-link"" href=""http://cdn.globalccsinstitute.com/sites/default/files/02%20Brazil%20-%20Report%20Three%20rev0_0.pdf"">2009 country study</A>.</P><H3>CCS initiatives and projects</H3><P><mark>Petrobras</mark> and a national university launched the <A class=""external-link"" href=""http://www.<mark>carbon</mark>capturejournal.com/displaynews.php?NewsID=53"">Energy and <mark>Carbon</mark> Storage Research Centre </A>in 2007.

CEPAC has also conducted a risk analysis for ranking storage reservoirs and will be releasing a storage atlas at the end of 2011.</P><P>The BCA is also considering CCS and is currently part of a joint venture with the Ministry of Science and Technology to build a clean coal centre.  It is also working with the <A class=""external-link"" href=""http://www.netl.doe.gov/"">NETL</A> in the US to develop a coal gasification programme.</P><P>The most significant CCS project to date in Brazil is by <mark>Petrobras</mark>. In early 2011, it announced plans to sequester <mark>CO2</mark> as part of EOR operations at its massive deep-water Lula oilfield – which has an estimated 6.5 billion barrels of recoverable oil. For more details, follow the link below.</P><P>There are a number of operating and planned CCS demonstration projects, including the <mark>Petrobras</mark> Miranga Project and the CEPAC Carbometano Porto Batista Project. More details via project links below.</P><P>Within R&amp;D, the Brazilian CCS Network, led by <mark>Petrobras</mark>, has established twenty CCS research projects around the country to work on every aspect of the CCS chain. It has also held a number of international CCS conferences within Brazil.</P><P><mark>Petrobras</mark> is currently evaluating the technological and economic potential for <mark>CO2</mark> storage within EOR operations in the pre-salt discovery areas, saline aquifers, heavy oil reservoirs in the Santos Basin oilfields and depleted gas fields - as well as storage in salt caverns, to be constructed in the pre-salt area. The country is also assessing the non-geological use of captured <mark>CO2</mark>, and biomass combined with CCS is attracting some attention - with its potential to create negative emissions.</P><P>The Brazilian <mark>Carbon</mark> Facility, a non-governmental initiative set up in 2005, connects <mark>carbon</mark> project developers to potential investors.</P><P>Storage</P><P>The results of the <A class=""external-link"" href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610211003766"">CARBMAP project </A>- the Brazilian <mark>Carbon</mark> Geological Sequestration Map - were presented in early 2011. Given Brazil's many sedimentary basins, the project aimed to identify appropriate sites for long-term <mark>CO2</mark> storage in oilfields, saline aquifers and coal seams. Phase I began in 2006–2007 with the mapping of stationary <mark>CO2</mark> sources using a geographic database. The second phase, currently under way, is focusing on developing a viable integrated geographic information system.</P><P><A class=""external-link"" href=""http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/proceedings/07/<mark>carbon</mark>-seq/data/papers/wed_025.pdf"">CARBMAP presentation, May 2007</A></P><H3>International co-operation</H3><P>The <mark>CO2</mark> Capture Project is a partnership of seven major energy companies – including Brazil's <mark>Petrobras</mark> – which aims to develop the technologies necessary for the deployment of industrial-scale CCS. It was set up in 2000 and has carried out more than 150 projects relating to the science, economic feasibility and technological requirements of CCS. The international group has been working closely with the US Department of Energy, the European Commission and more than 60 academic bodies and global research institutes.</P><P>The project is now in its third phase and announced in April 2011 the start of an oxy-combustion capture pilot trial on a fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCC) at a <mark>Petrobras</mark> research complex in Parana state, Brazil.

Temperature measurements are taken by both land and sea all over the world by several international organizations. Groups like NASA, NOAA, and the UK Met Office keep and manage their own temperature data, but they all show the same thing: the earth is warming. Overall, the planet has warmed about 1.6°F since the 1880s, and the 10 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1998. That includes 2014, which was the hottest single year on record.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""col-xs-12 col-md-4""><DIV class=""column""><H2>WHY IT'S IMPORTANT</H2><P>The rise in global temperature is the clearest single indicator of <mark>climate change</mark>. The fact that all three major dataset corroborate each other despite differences in analysis only strengthens confidence in what they show. Though 1.6°F might not sound like a big number, it has already contributed to an array of issues from melting Arctic sea ice to rising seas to shifting ecosystems, droughts and heat waves. Since the 1950s, each decade has been warmer than the last including a big jump after the 1970s. Temperatures are expected to rise even more steeply in the coming decades unless greenhouse gas emissions are curbed.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""container indicator-news""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""col-xs-12""><DIV class=""related-title""><H2>related News for <SPAN>Global Temperature</SPAN></H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,0.0,

By their nature, car makers are normally conservative beasts, but progress requires trying new things, even at the risk of the occasional failure. Often, these automotive experiments are carried out by racing departments—always catnip to nerds like me who begin to salivate at the mention of words like &quot;homologation.&quot;</P><P>But recently, the cars of <mark>BMW</mark>'s i brand have captivated me the most. The plug-in hybrid i8 remains my default answer when asked about my favorite car (this happens regularly in my line of work), and it surely represents the near-term future of the sports car.</P><P>What's not to like about the i8? It looks like a proper supercar—complete with dihedral doors—but it's as practical as a Porsche 911 and a lot more fuel-efficient. The i8 has a <mark>carbon</mark>-fiber chassis, so it's very stiff but very light. The damping is brilliant even on broken road surfaces, and the way the electric motor and internal combustion engine harmonize in Sport mode will put a smile on your face come rain or shine. A convertible—the i8 Roadster—joined the line-up at this year's LA Auto Show, along with a slightly souped-up version of its urban EV, the i3S.</P><P>With these (and the self-driving iNEXT, <A href=""https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/07/<mark>bmw</mark>-intel-and-mobileye-will-launch-an-autonomous-car-in-five-years/"">due in 2021</A>), <mark>BMW</mark> is grappling with <EM>mobility</EM>, the brave new transport future that some believe will save us from the ravages of car crashes and <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><H2>A <mark>BMW</mark> will always have a steering wheel</H2><P>Autonomous and electric vehicles should be well outside of <mark>BMW</mark>'s comfort zone. After all, this is a company best known for legendary internal combustion engines and building ad campaigns on the idea of driving for fun. So the fact that <mark>BMW</mark> is getting this stuff right so far bodes well for the future. It's a future where you'll always have the option of driving your own <mark>BMW</mark>, though.</P><P>&quot;What we do not say is that all the <mark>BMW</mark>s in the future will drive fully autonomously. It's up to our customers,&quot; said Robert Irlinger, head of <mark>BMW</mark> i. &quot;But if there is a customer demand for the technique, someone will use it. For example, LA rush hour—to be honest, it's not sheer driving pleasure. Just push the button, and then maybe your car will bring you to the next place.&quot;</P><P>Irlinger sees the <mark>BMW</mark> i cars of the future giving their drivers that time back in their days—it's up to us whether we use those extra minutes to churn out a few more emails or perhaps just chill out with some music. We saw one such expression of this idea in <A href=""https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/01/<mark>bmw</mark>-uses-ces-to-show-its-autonomous-i8-concept-to-the-world/"">the i Vision Future concept</A> at CES in 2016.</P><P>When the iNEXT arrives in three years, expect it to be a service you hail, not a car you buy from your <mark>BMW</mark> dealer. Irlinger says that's for several reasons; for one thing, it's easier for a managed fleet to remain perpetually up to date with software fixes. &quot;You need something like a pilot fleet in operating cars to gain experience [with autonomous vehicles),&quot; he explained. But cost is another concern, and for these early implementations of autonomous driving technology, that may well be prohibitive even for the earliest of adopters.</P><H2>Not your typical <mark>BMW</mark> drivers</H2><P>I learned some other interesting facts in my chat with Irlinger. For one, the i3 and i8 are being bought by customers who aren't traditional <mark>BMW</mark> drivers—only one in three i3 owners is a previous customer, and 80 percent of i8s are sold to people new to <mark>BMW</mark>.</P><P>According to Irlinger, the main lessons <mark>BMW</mark> i has learned from the i3 and i8 are that its customers have range and infrastructure on the brain, which is why <mark>BMW</mark> has been working with some other OEMs on a network of 350kW chargers in Europe. Perhaps we should be surprised that there has been almost no demand from existing i3 owners looking to <A href=""https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/05/battery-bump-for-<mark>bmw</mark>-i3-existing-owners-will-be-offered-upgrade-too/"">retrofit the new, larger battery pack</A>. (<mark>BMW</mark> told me that it has only had about five serious inquiries on the matter.)</P><P>The i experiment appears to be working. Just yesterday, the company heralded the fact that it has delivered more than 100,000 electrified vehicles in 2017, and Irlinger told me he expects 2018's i3 sales to eclipse this year's. Electrification is now showing up in more of the regular <mark>BMW</mark> lineup—the 530e plug-in hybrid has been selling well since arriving earlier this year, joining a PHEV X5 and 7 Series in the showroom. Irlinger even says there <EM>will</EM> be electrified M cars in the years to come. If they end up anything like the i8, that'll be cause for cheer.</P><P><EM>Listing image by <A href=""https://www.<mark>bmw</mark>usa.com""><mark>BMW</mark></A></EM></P></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""column-wrapper""><DIV class=""left-column""><SECTION class=""article-author""><DIV class=""author-bio""><SECTION class=""author-bio-top""><A href=""/author/jonathan-m-gitlin"" class=""author-name"">Jonathan M.

If those costs detracted from Apple's bottom line, the NCPPR demanded that Apple discontinue the programs and commit only to projects that are explicitly profitable. Cook apparently became angry at the group's request. According to an account from <A href=""http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/tim-cook-soundly-rejects-politics-of-the-ncppr-suggests-group-sell-apples-s"">MacObserver</A>:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>What ensued was the only time I can recall seeing Tim Cook angry, and he categorically rejected the worldview behind the NCPPR's advocacy. He said that there are many things Apple does because they are right and just, and that a return on investment (ROI) was not the primary consideration on such issues.</P><P>&quot;When we work on making our devices accessible by the blind,&quot; he said, &quot;I don't consider the bloody ROI.&quot; He said that the same thing about environmental issues, worker safety, and other areas where Apple is a leader.</P><P>…</P><P>He didn't stop there, however, as he looked directly at the NCPPR representative and said, &quot;If you want me to do things only for ROI reasons, you should get out of this stock.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>For the better part of the last decade, Apple has taken on a number of sustainability projects and adopted practices to reduce waste and <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. In 2012, it <A href=""http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/02/apple-confirms-plans-for-oregon-data-center-outlines-green-initiatives/"">broke ground</A> on a <A href=""http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/10/apple-breaks-ground-on-mammoth-colossal-gargantuan-oregon-data-center/"">data center</A> in Oregon in order to take advantage of low-cost renewable energy and <A href=""http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/05/what-it-takes-to-make-a-green-apple/"">has plans</A> to make all of its facilities reliant on green energy. It generally <A href=""http://ww2.epeat.net/publicsearchresults.aspx?stdid=1&amp;return=searchoptions&amp;epeatcountryid=1&amp;rating=3&amp;ProductType=3"">scores highly</A> with <A href=""http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/07/apple-leaving-green-product-registry-epeat-was-a-mistake/"">EPEAT</A>, a federal environmental group that keeps a registry of “green” digital devices. And in May 2013, it <A href=""http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/05/apple-hires-former-epa-head-to-handle-environmental-issues/"">hired Lisa Jackson</A>, who formerly ran the Environmental Protection Agency, to help Apple with sustainability.</P><P>NCPPR later issued a blustery <A href=""http://www.nationalcenter.org/PR-Apple_Tim_Cook_<mark>Climate</mark>_022814.html"">press release</A> about how Apple's desire to “combat so-called <mark>climate change</mark>” would destroy shareholder value. It accused &quot;the Al gore contingency in the room&quot; of greeting its questions &quot;with boos and hisses.&quot;</P><P>According to the press release, Justin Danhof, director of the National Center's Free Enterprise Project, said &quot;Mr. Cook made it very clear to me that if I, or any other investor, was more concerned with return on investment than reducing <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions, my investment is no longer welcome at Apple.&quot;</P><P>It seems clear that Apple won't halt its projects for <mark>climate change</mark> deniers, and the rest of its shareholders weren't troubled by that at all. The NCPPR's proposal received just 2.95 percent of the vote.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class=""inline-video"" title=""The Greatest Leap, Episode 3: Triumph"" data-video-overlay-template-id=""tmpl-5a340160148bb05431000005""><H3>Latest Ars Video <SPAN>&gt;</SPAN></H3><DIV class=""video-description""><H2>The Greatest Leap, Episode 3: Triumph</H2><SPAN>In honor of the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the Apollo Program, Ars Technica brings you an in depth look at the Apollo missions through the eyes of the participants.</SPAN></DIV><TEMPLATE type=""text/template"" id=""tmpl-5a340160148bb05431000005""><FIGURE class=""video""><FIGCAPTION class=""caption""><DIV class=""caption-text"">The Greatest Leap, Episode 3: Triumph</DIV></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H3>The Greatest Leap, Episode 3: Triumph</H3><P class=""excerpt"">In honor of the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the Apollo Program, Ars Technica brings you an in depth look at the Apollo missions through the eyes of the participants.</P></TEMPLATE></SECTION></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""column-wrapper""><DIV class=""left-column""><SECTION class=""article-author""><DIV class=""author-bio""><SECTION class=""author-bio-top""><A href=""/author/megan-geuss"" class=""author-name"">Megan Geuss</A>

Being a responsible corporate citizen is central to <mark>Toyota</mark>’s culture and is embedded in our <A href=""http://www.<mark>toyota</mark>-global.com/company/history_of_<mark>toyota</mark>/75years/data/conditions/philosophy/guiding_principles.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Guiding Principles</A>.</P><P>It is also important to become a company that can achieve “<mark>sustainable</mark> growth”, meaning growing our business while at the same time reducing any negative effects or externalities (e.g. GHG emissions)  from our operations and products. The spirit of this challenge propels our <mark>innovation</mark>, and is part of <mark>Toyota</mark>’s DNA. We wish to continue to be a company that creates a desirable future with our stakeholders and brings smiles to our customers and society.</P><H2>How is <mark>Toyota</mark> leading on sustainability?</H2><P><mark>Toyota</mark> has a broad portfolio of diverse initiatives promoting sustainability including:</P><UL><LI>As of Jan. 31, 2017, we have reached more than 10 million cumulative units of hybrid vehicle (HV) sales globally, including plug-in hybrids. The latest milestone was achieved just nine months after total global hybrid sales reached 9 million units at the end of April 2016.</LI><LI>Including Prius Prime, <mark>Toyota</mark> and Lexus now have 14 hybrid models available in North America; globally, we have 33. We estimate <mark>Toyota</mark>’s hybrid technology has helped save more than 7.66 billion gallons of gasoline worldwide and resulted in an estimated 77 million fewer tons of <mark>CO2</mark> emissions, since 1997 when Prius first became available in Japan.</LI><LI>In late 2015, we introduced the Mirai fuel cell electric vehicle in Japan, followed by Europe and California in 2016. The Mirai provides over 300 miles of driving range, a refuelling time of around five minutes, and the only tailpipe emission is water.  Mirai availability will expand as hydrogen infrastructure grows.</LI><LI>We have made close to 6,000 hydrogen fuel cell patents available, royalty free, to support the expansion of a hydrogen society.</LI><LI>We are a leader in the number of dealerships that have achieved Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) certification. With 54 and counting, <mark>Toyota</mark> and Lexus have more dealership facilities certified to LEED® standards in the U.S. and Canada than any other auto manufacturer.</LI></UL><H2>What is an example of an industry leading best practice in <mark>sustainable</mark> product or operations at <mark>Toyota</mark>?</H2><P>From a product perspective:</P><UL><LI>Our Prius Prime has an EPA-estimated 133 MPGe, making it the most fuel-efficient vehicle on the road today. The improved efficiency represents a substantial 26 percent enhancement over its predecessor.</LI><LI>Our Mirai fuel cell electric vehicle boasts one of the highest ranges of any zero emission vehicle on the road. Mirai is leading the world forward toward a more <mark>sustainable</mark> future.</LI><LI>Advanced battery research – breakthrough involving magnesium batteries
that could open the door for smaller, longer-lasting batteries for everything
from cell phones to cars. We published this research in the hopes of moving battery research along<STRONG>.</STRONG></LI></UL><P>From an operations perspective:</P><UL><LI>We achieved a 12th consecutive Energy Star Partner of the Year Sustained Excellence Award. <mark>Toyota</mark> was recognized with this award from the Environmental Protection Agency for its continued leadership in protecting the environment through energy efficiency. EPA recognizes Energy Star partners that demonstrate improved energy performance of buildings and plants through a corporate-wide energy program. Since 2002, <mark>Toyota</mark> has saved more than 16 billion kWh of electricity and realized cost savings of $640 million across its 14 North American manufacturing sites.</LI><LI>We are a founding member of the US Zero Waste Business Council and a thought-leader in developing new waste metrics. The U.S. ZWBC defines a Zero Waste Business as one with a 90 percent or greater diversion of all waste from landfill, incineration and the environment, with an ultimate goal of 100 percent diversion. <mark>Toyota</mark> is helping to define how to measure this, and, in the process, is helping to evolve waste management thinking from basic diversion of waste from landfill to reducing at the source and increasing reuse and recycling.</LI></UL><H2>Is <mark>Toyota</mark> transparent about its GHG emissions (including scope 3 or use of its products)?</H2><P>Yes. TMC reports global GHG emissions in its global environmental report and through CDP.  TMC provides <A href=""https://www.cdp.net/en#a8888e63070314c2285625253a462815"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">scope 3 data to CDP</A>, including for emissions from use of sold product.

<BODY><DIV id=""main""><DIV class=""wrapper active""><DIV class=""single_post""><H1><mark>Carbon</mark> Offsets Connection to Solving <mark>Climate Change</mark></H1><H3 class=""date"">Monday, 11 June 2012</H3><P>Environmental organizations, I believe, do a notoriously poor job communicating for our audience the positive of what we do, the results we achieve and the change we accomplish, whether they focus on <mark>carbon</mark>, energy, water, smog, soil or any number of environmental problems. The ability to connect business leaders, consumers and environmental activists with the positive <mark>climate</mark> results we aim to solve is crucial. I often feel we do a better job highlighting the problem (also critical), but not on sharing the results. So I want to address how <mark>carbon</mark> offsets, or <mark>carbon</mark> credits, help reduce the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, catalyze encourage low <mark>carbon</mark> technology and help pave the way to a cleaner, more <mark>sustainable</mark> environment for all of us.</P><P>The first step is to address that a <mark>carbon</mark> offset represents a reduction of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions from a project, in a manner verified by outside third-parties and using outside third-party standards, such as the Verified <mark>Carbon</mark> Standard, American <mark>Carbon</mark> Registry and <mark>Climate</mark> Action Reserve. The paper trail for a <mark>carbon</mark> offset shows these projects reduced emissions, whether from renewable energy, energy efficiency or forestry. This is one reason we give our supporters the choice of which types of projects to support and why we remain agnostic on which type of project is ‘better’. <mark>Carbon</mark> dioxide reductions are the goal, not the project type.</P><P>It is this connection of the project to the greenhouse gas reduction (<mark>carbon</mark> offset or <mark>carbon</mark> credit) that also ties it to solving <mark>climate change</mark>. Our planet does not care either where we emit <mark>carbon</mark> emissions or where we reduce them. Bali or Boston, same impact. <mark>Climate change</mark> is not impacted differently if a reduction comes from within a company’s premises or outside its premises. (This is different for other gases such as SO<SUB>2</SUB>, which causes acid rain and has a localized and regional impact, meaning it affects the area nearer to where it is emitted.)</P><P>So another benefit, then, is that <mark>carbon</mark> offsets allow us to direct funds to reducing <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions in the most cost effective manner. If <mark>carbon</mark> is <mark>carbon</mark> is <mark>carbon</mark>, then making a $100 donation going to reduce ten tonnes of <mark>carbon</mark> is more efficient than the same amount reducing just five tonnes.</P><P>What’s more, this brings about technology transfer and, often, international development. Since many developing countries are very inefficient in how they generate and manage their energy use, reducing emissions in the developing world is often much more cost effective than trying to make a <mark>BMW</mark> factory in Germany even more efficient than it already is. <mark>Carbon</mark> offsets enable this transfer of assets to reduce greenhouse gases cost efficiently, while still maintaining the verification and standards necessary to know the reductions are happening.</P><P><mark>Carbon</mark> offsets also bring more people to the table in terms of education about <mark>climate change</mark> and engagement in the solution. Most developing countries are not obligated to reduce their <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions and feel a strong sense they should not have to, while they are still developing (a topic for another day). However, when a <mark>carbon</mark> offset project comes to Brazil, India or China, local businesses, policy makers and individuals get to learn about and be part of the solution. This creates both knowledge transfer and buy in. And if the company is profiting from the project, which we would hope they are, even better for buy-in.</P><P>If we are going to solve <mark>climate change</mark> in the next few decades and stop a pending disaster, we simply must reduce our emissions substantially, by as much as 50-80% by mid-century. The less scary way of putting this is for us to aim for a 2% reduction in <mark>carbon</mark> emissions annually, but first we have to stop the growth. <mark>Carbon</mark> offsets are helping solve <mark>climate change</mark> in efficient ways by directing these massive investments toward the most efficient <mark>carbon</mark> reduction opportunity while benefitting both the <mark>climate</mark> and people.. In our best scenario, this efficiency spurs greater investment than would otherwise occur, which helps drive down the costs of new, clean, low-<mark>carbon</mark> technologies and projects. Ultimately, if enough investment helps wind, solar or another technology cost less than coal (a debatable figure but also a topic for another day), market transformation will occur based on straight economics and that will be a very good day for our planet, <mark>climate</mark> and us.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1.0,1.0,Positive

This is especially true of those in historically poor and disadvantaged Scheduled Tribe (ST) and Scheduled Caste (SC) communities. Although the entire population of women farmers in India face gender-based inequalities, women belonging to these communities are particularly marginalized, experiencing multiple layers of discrimination. The prevalence of Scheduled Tribe and Scheduled Caste communities is particularly high in the state of Odisha, located in the eastern region of the India. Poverty levels in the state are also high with a significant percent of its population living below the poverty line. The primary source of employment in the state has historically been agriculture and this continues to be the case. However, over the years, the sector has suffered from minimal investment, declining growth, and frequent natural disasters.</P><P>The Pathways program seeks to increase poor women’s productivity and empowerment in more equitable agriculture systems at scale using a strong gender focus, working with ST and SC communities in two rural districts of Kalahandi and Kandhamal of Odisha State in India. To address agricultural input access disparities, the program tested an <mark>innovation</mark> that brings affordable inputs closer to farmers—agricultural kiosks. With supplementary funding from Cargill, Inc., Pathways is working to close the input supply gap, using agricultural kiosks as <mark>sustainable</mark> providers of inputs and market information to assist farmers. Kiosks are placed in close proximity to Pathways villages and within access to well-paved roads, eliminating the burden of farmers traveling 25+ kilometers to blocks where they previously went to purchase inputs.

Survey data shows women at the baseline primarily sourced inputs from local producers, cooperatives and government programs, in the range of 12-14% of female farmer respondents for each of these groups. While sourcing from cooperatives and governments has decreased since baseline, inputs from local producers doubled to 26%. Similarly, there was a 23% increase in access to inputs from suppliers five or more kilometers away and a 40% increase in access to nearby suppliers such as agricultural kiosks, eliminating the burden of farmers traveling 25+ kilometers to blocks where previously they had to go to for inputs. At least half of the kiosk customers are women who are interested in paddy and kitchen garden inputs.</P></ARTICLE></DIV></MAIN></BODY></HTML>",0.0,1.0,

Solving a problem that has handicapped use of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) in transmission lines, networks, and power grids for more than 100 years, multinational power engineering giant <mark>ABB</mark> has announced that it has designed and developed a hybrid DC breaker capable of interrupting DC power flows “equivalent to the output of a nuclear power station within five milliseconds… as fast as a honeybee takes per flap of its wings.”</P><P>The hybrid DC breaker combines “advanced ultrafast mechanical actuators with <mark>ABB</mark>’s in-house semiconductor IGBT valve technologies or power electronics.” <mark>ABB</mark> management deems it a “game changer.”</P><P>Capable of carrying electricity over long distances much more efficiently than alternating current (AC), HVDC transmission is seen as a way of transporting renewable energy from remote utility-scale locations — such as desert solar power facilities and offshore wind farms — to consumption centers at much lower cost than existing transmission infrastructure.</P><P> </P><P> </P><H2>Stopping HVDC Flows Faster than the Blink of an Eye</H2><P>According to <mark>ABB</mark>, the breakthrough hybrid DC breaker “removes a significant stumbling block in the development of HVDC transmission grids where planning can start now. These grids will enable interconnection and load balancing between HVDC power superhighways integrating renewables and transporting bulk power across long distances with minimal losses,” technology manager for grid systems and HVDC grids program manager Magnus Callavik writes in a Nov. 7 post on the <A href=""http://www.<mark>abb</mark>-conversations.com/2012/11/<mark>abb</mark>-achieves-another-milestone-in-electrical-engineering"" target=""_blank""><mark>ABB</mark> Conversations blog</A>.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“DC grids will enable sharing of resources like lines and converter stations that provides reliability and redundancy in a power network in an economically viable manner with minimal losses. <mark>ABB</mark>’s new Hybrid HVDC breaker, in simple terms will enable the transmission system to maintain power flow even if there is a fault on one of the lines.” [<EM>sic</EM>]</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><mark>ABB</mark>’s hybrid circuit breaker is capable of blocking and breaking DC currents at thousands of amperes and several hundred thousands of volts, equivalent to the average power consumption of 1 million Europeans.</P><P>“It amounts to stopping power capable of feeding a large city much faster than an eye blink!,” <mark>ABB</mark> elaborates. “This speed helps protect the DC transmission system and prevent power outages in new low loss compact power superhighways. The next step is to install the breaker in pilot installations.”</P><H2>Edison and GE May Have Lost the Battle of the Currents…</H2><P>Promoted and developed by Nikola Tesla and Westinghouse, alternating current (AC) in the early 20th century won the so-called “<A href=""http://www.<mark>abb</mark>.com/cawp/seitp202/c646c16ae1512f8ec1257934004fa545.aspx"" target=""_blank"">War of the Currents</A>” versus DC, which was promoted and sponsored by Thomas Edison and General Electric. AC has since become the predominant form of electric current used in transmission lines, grids, buildings, and homes.</P><P>There are advantages to using DC at local and much smaller scales, however, according to <mark>ABB</mark>. DC is still used to distribute electricity — particularly in remote and isolated communities — and numerous and varied equipment and devices produce as well as run on DC (including batteries, solar panels, and wind turbines on the production side; and computers, cell phones, and LED lights on the consumption side), <mark>ABB</mark> notes in “Tesla vs Edison: the war of currents.”</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“At the moment, each of these appliances uses its own rectifier to switch power from AC to DC. A much more efficient solution would be to convert the power in a larger rectifier as it enters each building. <mark>ABB</mark> estimates the savings from using DC instead of AC in buildings could be in the order of 10 to 20 percent. Losses could be further reduced by converting power to DC at the substation level and distributing DC power throughout an entire district, or even by transmitting, distributing and using power as DC.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Building out DC distribution grids where AC counterparts already exist would be impractical, <mark>ABB</mark> acknowledges, but it sees DC as a “solution of choice” in newly built areas or cities, as well as for communities and installations that are off the grid at present. “Such islands include new ships and communities generating their own power from renewable resources,” <mark>ABB</mark> says.</P><P>Furthermore, <mark>ABB</mark> points out, “DC distribution would be particularly attractive for communities using power generated by photovoltaic solar panels, since this is already DC power and currently has to be converted to AC before distribution.”</P></ARTICLE></SECTION></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",0.0,2.0,Neutral

	Averaging over twelve-month periods smooths out the shorter-term variations. Globally, the twelve-month average from October 2016 to September 2017 is 0. 54°C above the 1981-2010 average. This is the second warmest, non-overlapping, twelve-month period on record and follows the warmest twelve-month period on record from October 2015 to September 2016, which had a temperature 0.64°C above average. 2016 is by far the warmest calendar year on record: its global temperature of 0.62°C above the average for 1981-2010 compares with the value of 0.44°C for 2015, the next warmest calendar year.

	The spread in the global averages from various temperature datasets has been unusually large in 2016 and 2017, due to differences in the extent to which datasets represent the relatively warm conditions that have predominated over both the Arctic and the Antarctic.

	There is more variability in average European temperatures, but values are less uncertain because observational coverage of the continent is relatively dense. Twelve-month averages for Europe were at a high level from 2014 to 2016. They have fallen over the past twelve months, but remain well above the 1981-2010 average.

This shared cause is the only way to achieve that collective dream.”</EM>

At least 180 times since the 1990s! But shockingly, none of the five meetings held with AMISA2 between December 2014 and January 2016 by senior Commission officials has been publicly declared as required by the rules.</P><P>So what do we know about AMISA2?</P><P><STRONG>Background</STRONG></P><P>According to Georg Brodach, AMISA2’s president (who was willing to answer <A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/email_exchanges_feb_2016.pdf"">CEO’s </A><A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/email_exchanges_feb_2016.pdf"">emailed </A><A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/email_exchanges_feb_2016.pdf"">questions</A>), AMISA2 holds monthly breakfast meetings, mostly with a senior speaker from one of the EU institutions, “<A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=646699114665-12"">in order to educate corporate representatives about recent developments in EU policy fields</A>”.</P><P>Brodach sent <A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/01-2016_past_guest-speakers_and_topics.pdf"">a list of the </A><A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/01-2016_past_guest-speakers_and_topics.pdf"">breakfast </A><A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/01-2016_past_guest-speakers_and_topics.pdf"">meetings </A><A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/01-2016_past_guest-speakers_and_topics.pdf"">held</A> and the speakers; the list dates back to 1994 and comprised a massive 293 meetings in total. Generally, these were with senior level officials (cabinet members, directors-general or their deputies), but other familiar names crop up too. Connie Hedegaard, previous commissioner for <mark>climate</mark> action, has addressed an AMISA2 breakfast, as have the US ambassador to the EU; the Russian permanent representative to the EU; Giovanni Kessler, controversial Director General of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF); and top-EU-official-turned-tobacco-lobbyist <A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/revolvingdoorwatch/cases/michel-petite"">Michel Petite</A>.</P><P>Timely meetings have been held with:</P><UL><LI>Jos Delbeke, Director General, DG CLIMA on “what outcome should business expect from the COP21 <mark>Climate Change</mark> Conference in Paris” in May 2015, in the run-up to these important <mark>climate</mark> negotiations</LI><LI>Dominique Ristori, Director General, DG ENER on “The Energy Agenda” in September 2014, as the Energy Union is under-development</LI><LI>Olivier Guersent, Head of Cabinet of Michel Barnier, (then Commissioner Internal Market and Services) on the “Single Market – a Status Report” in June 2013</LI><LI>Horst Reichenbach, Head of the Taskforce for Greece, on “GREECE: Achievements and Future Challenges”, in March 2013, during the Greek debt crisis.</LI></UL><P>Georg Broadch himself, the president of AMISA2, calls himself an “Experienced Public Affairs Executive” on his <A href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/georg-brodach-1a439b"">LinkedIn profile</A> and has a history of working for major European companies. He spent 14 years with <mark>ABB</mark>, the power technology company; five years with AT&amp;T, the telecoms firm; and 10 years at German business associations.</P><P><STRONG>Corporate capture</STRONG></P><P>AMISA2’s <A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/2016-02-17_list_amisa2_membership_2016.pdf"">17 corporate </A><A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/2016-02-17_list_amisa2_membership_2016.pdf"">members</A>, as declared to CEO by Brodach, are: <mark>ABB</mark>, Airbus, Allianz, Amgen, BASF, Bayer, Dow Europe, ExxonMobil, Google, Norsk Hydro, LyondellBasell Industries, Michelin, Oracle, PGA, F. Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche), Solvay, and Total and, judging from the attendance lists at some of the breakfasts, there is a consistency about who attends the meetings from these companies. In fact, “the rule” is that only the head of a Brussels office can participate in AMISA2 breakfast meetings, so effectively that company’s top EU lobbyist.</P><P>These organisations each pay €4000 a year to be a member of AMISA2, more than enough to keep a roomful of lobbyists in croissants and coffee for a year. Presumably these membership fees are the source of the €60,000 budget declared in AMISA2’s lobby register declaration, the majority of which is spent on lobbying. AMISA2’s <A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=646699114665-12"">decl</A><A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=646699114665-12"">a</A><A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=646699114665-12"">red lobby spend</A> for 2015 is €25,000-€49,999; it’s not known on what else it spends its money.</P><P>CEO asked AMISA2 for the minutes of these breakfast meetings so that we could see exactly what is being discussed. However, Brodach <A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/email_exchanges_feb_2016.pdf"">told us</A>:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“There are no minutes and there is no result, because there is no common set of interests and the intention is not to come to a “result” whatsoever … if not to learn, understand and be educated on the topic. We are not a lobbying organization.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>But we find this disingenuous. While two chemical companies, or two energy companies might be competitors in the market place, more likely than not, they will also have very similar interests when it comes to EU policy-making. Corporations across sectors share many common interests and agendas when it comes to trade, tax, regulation and other matters. If that was not so, there would be no trade associations and no role for organisations like BusinessEurope which put forward common business demands.</P><P>Additionally, DG Trade’s <A href=""http://www.asktheeu.org/en/request/2593/response/9540/attach/4/Attachment.pdf"">internal </A><A href=""http://www.asktheeu.org/en/request/2593/response/9540/attach/4/Attachment.pdf"">minutes</A> of the meeting that Jean-Luc Demarty, Director General at DG TRADE, spoke at in February 2014 on “Recent Developments of the EU Trade Agenda” indicate that corporations get plenty of opportunity to ask questions about issues which concern their business, with Demarty providing direct one-to-one answers back. If this is any indication of how the other breakfast meetings work, it is not hard to see why senior staffers from major corporations are keen to participate in AMISA2.</P><P>And these corporations represent some of Brussels’ biggest lobbyists, between them declaring at least €28,589,000 lobby spend in the last year for which figures are available, and holding 73 European Parliament access passes. According to <A href=""http://www.integritywatch.eu/"">IntegrityWatch</A>, these corporations have, between them, held 217 lobbying meetings with the top brass at the Commission since December 2014. (All data correct as of 16 May 2016 and available in <A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/amisa2_members_in_lobby_register.xlsx"">this spreadsheet</A>.)</P><P>AMISA2 events are not advertised publicly and no one else attends. Oh, apart from “personal friends” of Brodach who are invited to ‘“beef-up” the audience.</P><P><STRONG>Transparency</STRONG></P><P>Notwithstanding Brodach’s candour when we approached him directly, AMISA2 is an opaque organisation and the lack of a website, or other public sources of information, is problematic.</P><P>Its members are not very open about their membership either. Of the 17 corporate members, only 5 (<mark>ABB</mark>, Amgen, Dow Europe, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, and Total) list AMISA2 in their lobby transparency declarations. The other 12 (71 per cent) do not bother.</P><P>But even more problematic, the Commission is also not transparent about its contacts with AMISA2. At least five of the breakfast meetings which have been held with AMISA2 since December 2014 have been held with top officials at the Commission who are <A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/3/2014/EN/3-2014-9004-EN-F1-1.Pdf"">now required to </A><A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/3/2014/EN/3-2014-9004-EN-F1-1.Pdf"">publish all their lobby meetings</A>.

Which was more important to you in the past election? And how do you view the appointment of Scott Pruitt as the new administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency? <STRONG>William Reilly:</STRONG> I decided several elections ago that I could no longer support a presidential candidate who rejected the science on climate change. Republican presidential candidates up through John McCain in 2008 did accept the science, and McCain was even the lead GOP sponsor of the climate bill, McCain-Lieberman, in the Senate. For a prospective EPA administrator to doubt or even contest a conclusion that 11 national academies of science have embraced is willful political obstruction. By all reports, Scott Pruitt is a highly intelligent lawyer and he has cited no alternative scientific authority that disputes mainstream science. Science is the secular religion underlying everything EPA does, and one who cannot rely on it, or is determinedly contemptuous of it, cannot effectively lead the agency or serve as the country’s environmental conscience, which is EPA’s unique mission.</P><P><STRONG>e360:</STRONG> What was your first thought when you heard that Scott Pruitt will lead the agency? </P><P><STRONG>Reilly:</STRONG> There has never been a more explicit and opposing interpretation of the authority and responsibility of EPA by an EPA nominee. Scott Pruitt has petitioned to reverse President Obama’s Clean Power rule to reduce CO2 from electric generating plants. These account for about a third of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, and so the rule is one of the major pillars of the U.S. effort to avert catastrophic climate change. I have submitted a legal brief vigorously disputing Pruitt’s interpretation of the law and the very role of EPA on climate. </P></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--pullquoteBlock""><BLOCKQUOTE class=""article__pullquote"">“One hopes that in four years someone claiming to be a Republican environmentalist won’t make people laugh.”</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--textBlock""><P><STRONG>e360: </STRONG>Mr. Pruitt has sued the agency because it attempted to reduce methane emissions. Do you see that as a conflict of interest? </P><P><STRONG>Reilly:</STRONG> I would not argue that Pruitt is conflicted because he has sued to overturn EPA’s methane rule. Lawyers argue cases, defend positions, represent clients — it’s what they do. The key question for Pruitt in his Senate confirmation is, what does he believe and propose to do as EPA administrator to reduce methane emissions? Many energy companies are working to reduce them. Does he have an alternative to the rule? Are these emissions tolerable? <STRONG>e360: </STRONG>How painful is Trump’s environmental policy for somebody like you who is both an environmentalist and a Republican? <STRONG>Reilly:</STRONG> One hopes that in four years someone claiming to be a Republican environmentalist won’t make people laugh. A Republican — President Nixon — created the EPA precisely to avert a race to the bottom by states competing for polluting industries. Trump’s environmental positions, judging from the Republican Party platform and his campaign statements — climate change is a hoax conceived by the Chinese, the EPA should be dismantled and its authorities transferred to the states — would roll back the clock. <STRONG>e360:</STRONG> How was it possible that the Republicans stopped listening to scientific advice? <STRONG>Reilly:</STRONG> This begins with the traditional conservative wariness about excesses of government and costs of regulation. The Tea Party, the coal mining industry and its workers, industry spokesmen who have blamed their decline on pollution controls, nativists who fear loss of sovereignty from the Paris agreements — all that is involved. <STRONG>e360:</STRONG> Who is the driving force within the Republican Party? <STRONG>Reilly:</STRONG> When I have asked Republican Congress members who fully understand climate change but are constrained by constituent pressures, who is it that feels so strongly opposed to climate initiatives, they tell me it’s evangelicals. Evangelicals constitute something like a third of GOP voters, and they voted 80 percent for Donald Trump. Hence Republican office holders from the Southwest, for example, say that they would be defeated in their primaries if they were to vote for carbon regulation. <STRONG>e360: </STRONG>Do you think that the climate- and Earth-monitoring programs the U.S. government runs through agencies like NASA, NOAA, or EPA will survive four years of Trump? </P><P><STRONG>Reilly:</STRONG> There will undoubtedly be efforts to muzzle them. The entire world will lose something very valuable if that is allowed to happen. Much of the science on climate — on causes, chemistry, and measuring climate change — has been done by U.S. agencies: NOAA [the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration], NASA, NCAR [the National Center for Atmospheric Research], EPA. The budgets and priorities of these agencies must be watched very carefully for they are likely to represent countervailing opinions to the administration’s climate deniers, and they won’t like it. <STRONG>e360:</STRONG> Speaking of NASA, what is your opinion about plans to cut its Earth-monitoring programs? <STRONG>Reilly:</STRONG> Cuts in NASA’s Earth monitoring program would be so destructive, a reckless head-in-the-sand posture that says, “If we don’t look, then nothing bad will happen.” <STRONG>e360:</STRONG> If you were an EPA official — would you consider quitting? Do you have any advice? <STRONG>Reilly:</STRONG> When I took office as EPA administrator in 1989, the environment had not been a priority for the eight years of the Reagan administration. However, after a scandalous two years when Reagan had a deregulator running EPA, the ship was righted and some good things got done, including the Montreal Protocol [to protect the ozone layer]. I had the good fortune to inherit many fine civil servants who had weathered the storm of attempted relaxation of environmental protections, and I was frankly amazed and impressed that some of the best people had stayed at the agency through the darkest years, even as their leader was fired and one senior official went to prison. So I would not advocate that committed people leave. We need them now more than ever! </P></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--pullquoteBlock""><BLOCKQUOTE class=""article__pullquote"">“If there is anything positive to say, I suppose it is to acknowledge that the president-elect is not an ideologue.”</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIV class=""article__block article__block--textBlock""><P><STRONG>e360:</STRONG> What will happen to U.S. renewable energy and to the Paris climate treaty now? </P><P><STRONG>Reilly: </STRONG>Last year, 60 percent of new solar installations were utility grade — that represents a breakthrough. I believe there is enough support in the Congress and the states to protect renewables, which are becoming competitive now. California, Texas, and other states will continue to support renewables. The good news in America is that the country is decarbonizing. The success of fracking, the resulting plentiful supply and low price of natural gas, is displacing coal and leading to annual stable or even decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, all without the Clean Power rule. </P><P><STRONG>e360:</STRONG> If Donald Trump puts his promises into effect, how will this affect the global efforts to limit climate change? <STRONG>Reilly:</STRONG> One has to hope that the European Union and China stay the course set in Paris if Trump disavows the commitments. I was in Beijing recently and spoke with senior government officials. Pollution reduction is a major source of public anger and concern and as coal consumption comes down and pollution is reduced, so too will CO2. I worry more about India, which has been explicit that it will require outside financing if it’s to reduce its carbon footprint and honor its promises made in Paris. <STRONG>e360:</STRONG> Can you imagine an outside event that might change the current course of the Trump administration? <STRONG>Reilly:</STRONG> I have long believed that, unfortunately, a catastrophe will be necessary to jolt American opinion to demand the urgent and sweeping measures required to avert severe inhospitable weather. American politics can turn on a dime. George Bush, who served for eight years as Ronald Reagan’s vice president, is the same man who promised in his campaign to be “the environmental president” and who appointed me, the president of the World Wildlife Fund at the time, as his EPA administrator, and who initiated a fabulously successful and cost-effective clean air law. <STRONG>e360:</STRONG> Are there positive aspects of Donald Trump’s environmental agenda? <STRONG>Reilly:</STRONG> If there is anything positive to say, I suppose it is to acknowledge that the president-elect is not an ideologue, is not apparently a fervent climate denier, is someone who follows polling results and who presumably will be exposed to high-level briefings on science and climate which his entourage has not yet tapped. There is also likely to be a reinvigoration of people and groups determined to ensure that states and cities adapt and prepare for climate change and promote the energy efficiencies, renewables, water conservation, and agricultural transformation that will help people flourish and prosper even as the earth warms and the sea level rises. <STRONG>e360:</STRONG> Is the appointment of Rex Tillerson, CEO of Exxon, as Secretary of State the death-blow for U.S. environmental policy? <STRONG>Reilly:</STRONG> I would offer a counter-intuitive measure of respect. It was Tillerson who discontinued his predecessor’s funding of climate deniers. He imposed a high shadow carbon price when assessing the anticipated returns from capital investments. He has publicly supported a carbon tax and has acknowledged the science and characterized climate change as a serious challenge. I know from my experience as co-chair of President Obama’s Commission on the BP Gulf of Mexico disaster that ExxonMobil’s competitors and peers regard the company as the most environmentally effective and safety conscious of all the major [oil companies]. For that reason, I asked him to speak at one of our hearings and to explain how his company had transformed itself after its own disaster in Alaska [the Exxon Valdez oil spill] in 1989 when I was EPA administrator. </P></DIV><ASIDE class=""article__block article__block--footnoteBlock article__block--footnoteBlock--align-left"" role=""complementary""><H3 class=""footnote-head"">Words of Caution on Climate From Obama's Top Scientist</H3><P>In an interview with <EM>Yale e360</EM>, President Obama’s chief science adviser, John Holdren, talks about the urgency of the climate challenge and why he hopes the next administration will not abandon efforts to address it. <A href=""https://e360.yale.edu/features/obama_top_scientist_words_of_caution_climate_john_holdren"">Read more.</A></P></ASIDE><DIV class=""article__block article__block--textBlock""><P><STRONG>e360:</STRONG> There are fears he will team up with the authoritarian government of Russia to help fossil fuel exploitation in the Arctic. </P><P><STRONG>Reilly:  </STRONG>His familiarity with Russia is deep, and I suspect he has no illusions. He has stated that Russia has no rule of law. As to whatever major exploration Russia and ExxonMobil may do in the Arctic, my own knowledge of the industry would indicate that most Arctic countries — Canada, Norway, Greenland, the U.S. — are all planning major Arctic exploration and investments. So better Rosneft [the state-owned Russian oil company] has a responsible partner. As to the sanctions, one must hope that he views them through a different lens once he speaks not for his company, but for America.

Current forecasts indicate problems are more imminent. Midwestern plant zone changes have already led Chicago to cease planting Norway spruce, maple, and ash trees in the parks. Termites, tropical diseases, and bark beetles all are flourishing and moving into warming regions. Zika and dengue fever are in Florida and Texas. The problem, the challenge, is upon us. Time is important, and it appears the nation will not lead on the most urgent planetary challenge in modern history, which is profoundly saddening. But Washington is not the only locus of change and policy in America, and competing centers of influence are mobilizing in this very big and dynamic country. None of us who care are giving up. </P></DIV></SECTION></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,0.0,

                            Today’s increase in renewable energy production means the way electricity is generated, transmitted and distributed is changing from a traditional centralised model to a more distributed localised way of doing things. Peter Jones, technology strategy manager at <mark>ABB</mark>, explains.
                        </P><DIV class=""body-content""><P>“What we’re looking at is the idea of ‘distributed energy resource’,” says <mark>ABB</mark>’s Peter Jones. He explains the term has been coined to accommodate the fact that there are contributing factors beyond renewables that go into today’s power generation, transmission and distribution mix. “If photovoltaics (PV) or onshore wind is part of that, then so be it, but what is really important is that we are moving away from large-scale centralised generation. That’s the main issue.”</P><P>Renewables are only part of a mix covered by the term, which also includes combined heat and power (CHP) and energy storage. “One of the challenges is to operate systems that have these elements within it.” It’s a Brave New World where conventional national grids are making way for a future that includes localised micro power grids.</P><P>“Because I’ve worked with <mark>ABB</mark> for 17 years, and because I’ve come from a utilities background, I understand network planning,” says Jones. In the course of those 17 years, he has been involved in “pretty much all of the main grid technology that <mark>ABB</mark> is involved with in operational roles: high voltage DC, wind farms, energy storage, network control systems and so on. I’ve been hands-on.”</P><P>Three years ago, <mark>ABB</mark> asked Jones to review the characteristics of a changing marketplace, “and based on the toolkit of technology that we have, start clarifying what was happening specifically in the UK” with a view to analysing what technologies needed to be prioritised in response to the prevailing economic conditions. This was to further ensure the company wasn’t pushing technology “into an arena that wasn’t really ready for it. Rather, it was to understand what the market requirements were and then build a case for putting it in place.” He says that, as technology strategy manager, his brief was to look at trends and identify business cases while structuring opportunities for the application of the emerging technical <mark>innovation</mark>s he understands so well.</P><P>Having spent “30-plus years in the industry”, Jones spent his early career working in areas such as centralised planning and design standards at a time when the market was dominated by fossil fuels and nuclear power. “But in the past decade, there’s been this gradual change that started with wind power,” which he describes as originally being a ‘contained’ market event. Yet, as the reduction in the price of renewables had an impact on the network, it presented a challenge to the traditional areas of centralised generation, transmission and distribution. “Looking at today’s network, we are seeing a higher penetration of renewables, while advances in technology are challenging the topology of these networks. Which means that people like me are now faced with how we are going to deal with this.”</P><P>The big questions on everyone’s lips are: “How are we going to deal with power flows going in the wrong direction? How are we going to deal with generation being in the wrong location? How are we going to deal with demand that isn’t in the right place? How are we going to deal with a lack of centralised generation?” Jones sums up the position by explaining that once “there would have been a great big power station with a couple of power lines and people taking what they were given. Now we have a situation that is much more dynamic. We also have a situation where third parties are starting to come into the mix as well, and that is really quite exciting.” In the power game, he says, new players are slowly displacing the traditional players “who are looking to deliver new business models. To say this is a challenge is to understate the position, because the technology involved is considerable.”</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""blockquote""><P>‘‘Alternative’ energy has gone beyond a societal wish. It now makes economic sense to look at decentralisation and distributed energy.’</P><FOOTER class=""blockquote-footer"">Peter Jones, technology strategy manager, <mark>ABB</mark></FOOTER></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Jones says the uptake in renewables was ‘obviously’ driven by the <mark>climate</mark> agenda, while admitting that his personal view is that “nobody really thought that it would take off to the extent that it has done”. Neither does he think we predicted adequately just how readily society would accept renewable energy. But “what people really underestimated was the price drop in the technology”. He refers to the Non Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO), the government’s primary instruments of renewable energy policy, in which emerging forms of energy supply were labelled ‘alternative’: a landscape that was regarded as either fringe or ‘nice’. Yet gradually, factors related to the decentralisation of generation “mean that renewables has gathered its own momentum, particularly with PV”.</P><P>While outliers of the movement were either visionaries or those simply on the lookout for subsidies, there was a middle ground of suppliers with a desire to provide an economically viable source of renewable energy that could contribute in a significant way to the national power mix.</P><P>In cases such as this, Jones says you’ve got to look at what is the main driver. While it is tempting to think the desire to appear ‘green’ was a strong candidate, “the main driver was the cost. In the early years, this was clearly subsidy-driven with a lot of emphasis on <mark>climate change</mark>.” Yet in the UK, “we took the approach that we would enable society’s wishes while fundamentally observing the real issue, which was cost. Our regulator has put a lot in place to enable low <mark>carbon</mark>, but it is primarily about cost. If you can put forward a solution that has <mark>carbon</mark> saving within it – which is difficult to put a value on – there is still always the question of the deliverable cost-saving to the customer.”</P><P>Today, says Jones, ‘alternative’ energy is self-sustaining, and “it can’t be stopped. This is because it has gone beyond a societal wish. It now makes economic sense to look at decentralisation and distributed energy.” The consensus in the market, he says, is that distributed energy will probably come in at a lower cost. “It is this cost argument now, rather than green credentials, that is a much more solid way of bringing this transition from centralised to distributed power into place. The early governmental subsidies for renewables were very brave. But they were always there to prime the pump for a future of distributed energy resource.”</P><P>Jones says that as a force in the power generation, transmission and distribution market, <mark>ABB</mark> provides technology to the industry “whichever way it goes”.</P><P>He means that as technologists, the company follows the market. “If it was for centralised generation and long-distance transmission, then <mark>ABB</mark> has that portfolio. If the market was for decentralised digitalisation and high levels of control ‘behind the meter’, then we have that too.</P><P>“We have the technology, but our brief is to look at what the drivers are. What we are seeing globally is that the trends are the same as in the UK,” which is a move away from large centralised generation plant that the industry is starting to view as ‘not bankable’. This implication that it makes more financial sense to work on a distributed basis can be seen “practically everywhere,” says Jones. It’s not so much that centralisation is “yesterday thinking”, as he carefully points out. “I would say that the market economics of big investments in centralised plants are less attractive in the current <mark>climate</mark>.”</P><P>At the same time, the economics of decentralisation are becoming more attractive. “At one time it was simply not thought feasible that it would be better to provide energy locally. It was always felt that the best way was to apply to a utility to get a connection. Yet now people are responding to a market pull, driven by a growing interest in available technology. They are looking to combine technologies and optimise use.”</P><P>As an example, Jones cites the Cheshire Energy Hub: “a group of customers that produces power and consumes large amounts of it”. One of its members is Peel, which has developed a 51MW onshore wind farm and through its Protos development, a 21MW biomass plant “right next to a science park. What Peel has asked is, if they were to optimise their resources locally, would that be a lower-cost solution than connecting to a traditional network?”</P><P>What’s important about this example, says Jones, is that “there are a number of people starting to think like that”. He says that where <mark>ABB</mark> comes in to a discussion like this, it isn’t to help them run the figures, but to deliver the appropriate technology to see the project through. “We can monitor and control a CHP plant and we can monitor, measure and control a biomass plant and collectively look right over the top of all this (because we have the software systems to do so), and provide data for the best solution.</P><P>“We’re speaking to customers asking us to tell them about micro-grids,” essentially investigating the feasibility of “operating as an island, only calling on the grid network when we need it. Is it possible to mix gas and electricity to reduce our energy costs? There are also third-party financial institutions looking into whether they can provide capacity into large cities.” What this means for Jones is that there are clients “asking us to show that this technology exists”.</P><P>However, it has to work financially. “The main thing about centralised power generation in the past was that it was well-​proved that economies of scale were a huge factor. Yet it was never considered that a localised approach may be cost-effective too, while also allowing for the accommodation of more renewables.” Of course, it is more complex than that, because, as Jones says, “there are many, many strands running in parallel here. There are the economies of digitisation, which now make it possible to control and monitor so many pieces of equipment.” There is also the consideration that while it is possible for centralised generation providers to accommodate renewables – and Jones states that there are providers doing a good job in this area – “there are also those that have hit the limit. For example, centralised systems in the south-west with high inclusion of PV are experiencing big constraints. During the peak in summer, there’s a large amount of power trying to flow back up transmission systems that were never designed to take that sort of flow.”</P><P>What this means is that decentralisation, with optimised digitisation and control, allows for better movement of power into areas “where it could be used, which in turn would allow you to put more renewables on the network. You get a double win: if you’re using more renewables, then you’re simply getting more from renewables. But you’re also avoiding a large amount of network reinforcement costs.”</P><P>With distributed energy, “what we are starting to see are multi-stranded benefits. It’s not straightforward or simple, but it is starting to appear.” Jones then cites the case of China – “which we think of as having large centralised coal-fired plants with large renewables up in the mountains” – that is committed to high PV and wind targets. “Because these targets are eye-wateringly high, they cannot absorb all of that renewable power into their transmission system because they can’t shift it about, and they too are running into problems. So they have a two-stranded approach. First, you put as much as you economically can onto the general system, while then having local distribution accommodated within the network. When you start talking about accommodating large amounts of renewable energy cost-effectively on a network, you’re talking distribution level, where the economics start to swing in your favour.”</P><P>What this example shows, says Jones, is that distributed energy resource isn’t just driven by the British market or the green agenda, but by engineering principles, which are, in a nutshell: “If you can’t use it, try and get it to where it’s going to be used. If you can’t use it at the right time, look to see if you can find a technology that will allow you to manage that. That’s what we are seeing globally, it’s what the market is telling us locally, and we’re seeing customer groups that are coming to us asking us if there is another way.” This ‘other way’ finds itself in that Brave New World, aligned to a cusp of technology change driven by market economic forces and, to an extent, green values targets.</P><P>What’s going to happen next? “From what I can see, the future is not going to follow the rules. There are an awful lot of network assets out there and they are not easy to change because of the money involved. So we are finding ourselves constrained by them. However, market pull is really testing this situation by demanding <mark>innovation</mark>. It’s extremely early days. Yet who would have thought that changes we have seen in other technological spheres would have happened?”</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></ARTICLE></BODY></HTML>",2.0,2.0,Positive

                            Fracking companies are challenging the Scottish Government’s “unlawful” ban on their industry which has been in place 2015.

The operator Third Energy had <A rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""/content/articles/2017/10/third-energy-hoping-to-test-uk-s-first-fracking-procedure-in-the-coming-weeks/"" target=""_blank"">plans to start test operation </A>at the end of last year, although this was postponed until autumn this year while it waited for final government approval. </P><P>Grangemouth owner <mark>Ineos</mark> is seeking a judicial review of the “unlawful” ban, arguing there were “very serious errors” in the decision-making process.</P><P>In January operations director at <mark>Ineos</mark> Shale Tom Pickering said: “The decision in October was a major blow to Scottish science and its engineering industry, as well as being financially costly to <mark>Ineos</mark>, other businesses and, indeed, the nation as a whole.</P><P>“We have serious concerns about the legitimacy of the ban and have therefore applied to the court to ask that it review the competency of the decision to introduce it.”</P><P>The company, which owns two fracking licences in Scotland, said the ban on unconventional oil and gas extraction would result in Scotland missing out on economic benefits, including about 3,100 Scottish jobs and £1 billion for local communities.</P><P>Environmental charity Friends of the Earth Scotland (FoE Scotland) last month submitted a public interest intervention in the case.</P><P>It will argue that the fracking ban is lawful and necessary to meet Scotland’s legally binding <mark>climate change</mark> commitments.</P><P>The organisation’s lawyers say they believe it is the first public interest intervention granted in the Court of Session on environmental grounds.</P><P>FoE Scotland’s head of campaigns, Mary Church, said: “We are getting involved in <mark>Ineos</mark>’s judicial review of the fracking ban in order to put forward crucial <mark>climate change</mark> arguments in support of the ban that otherwise would not have been heard.</P><P>“Our intervention argues that the Scottish Government is required to ban fracking so as to urgently cut greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, in line with legally binding <mark>climate</mark> targets.</P><P>“We are confident that the process to ban fracking was robust and fair.”</P><P>A spokesman for <mark>Ineos</mark> said: “<mark>Ineos</mark> Shale is asking the Scottish Court to decide whether the fracking ban is lawful. We believe the Scottish Government exceeded its powers and lacked competence to impose a ban.”</P><P>A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “Out of respect for the integrity of the judicial review process, it would be inappropriate to comment on the case put forward by any of the other parties during an ongoing litigation.”</P><P>A recent study from the University of Manchester found that shale gas is <A rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""/content/articles/2018/01/shale-gas-one-of-the-least-<mark>sustainable</mark>-ways-to-produce-electricity-study-shows/"" target=""_blank"">one of the least <mark>sustainable</mark> </A>ways to produce electricity.  </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></ARTICLE></BODY></HTML>",2.0,2.0,Negative

In India to inaugurate a $100-million corn milling unit of his firm in Karnataka, MacLennan told ET that 2016 will be a good year for consumers as the downturn in commodities is likely to continue. Edited excerpts from an interview:</EM><STRONG>You are here to inaugurate Cargill’s corn milling facility in Karnataka. What are your future plans for India?</STRONG> I was here last in March 2014… In less than two years we have a new corn mill. We have 550 employees at our shared services business in Bengaluru from zero two years ago. We project to have another 500 employees in next 12-15 months. Cargill has embarked on a worldwide business services approach. So we have five shared services centres in the world with Bengaluru being one of them. I get to India every other year. So I was here 22 months ago and will be here again soon. <STRONG>What do you think has changed in the past 22 months?</STRONG> We have certainly changed. We have a new corn mill and 500 employees. Soon we will have a new animal feed mill in Punjab. So our business profile is changing. Siraj (Cargill India chairman Siraj A Chaudhry) and his colleagues have been able to grow our edible oil business based in Gurgaon. I think the business <mark>climate</mark> seems to be friendlier, people are more optimistic since (Narendra) Modi came in power. The feedback that I have got since I have been here is that the ease of doing business is becoming less cumbersome. <STRONG>What are your plans for India in term of investment?</STRONG> We are going to build 60,000 tonnes of storage near our corn mill in Karnataka. So that's a $10-million investment. So I think between the three investments (corn mill unit, animal feed business in Punjab and storage) we have put a lot of money in the country. Next we want to see the business grow to the potential and give returns on our investment. Right now in near term we don’t have plans for additional capital, but better the things go with our investment the more willing we will be to continue to invest. <STRONG>Chinese <A href=""/topic/economy"" target=""_blank"">economy</A> just saw its slowest growth in 25 years. How long do you see the down cycle of commodities globally?</STRONG> At least another year I think (for the down cycle to continue). China has significant stocks of corn. We can keep speculating that what will happen when it starts releasing the stock in the market. I think we have seen record growing seasons in North and South America in the last couple of years. There is no pressure on prices relative to petroleum prices. So I think it is very good for consumers. Low prices are here to stay for at least the next year, but of course that can always change in case of a significant weather event. It’s been a very moderate winter for <A href=""/topic/North-America"" target=""_blank"">North America</A> and from where I am, things can change very quickly. But I think for the foreseeable future, next one year, it looks that the down cycle in commodities will continue. There is plenty of stock (wheat, corn, soyabean) available globally. <STRONG>CEOs of developed world talk about BRICS economy. What is your view on investing in emerging markets?</STRONG> Emerging markets are down. We have invested significantly in emerging markets, but I don’t think it’s time to panic. If you are in the US things are good and if in Europe it is not bad. We have to be patient and have conviction that this is the place you want to be for the long term. So no one in Cargill is saying that we want to run away from BRICS. We are a 151-yearold company and we have gone through so many cycles in business history and this is another one. We look at where is opportunity, where we can be successful, where can we grow, rather than this is better than that place, and we should invest. <STRONG>Are you watching <mark>climate change</mark>?</STRONG> We have been very active in trying to be a thought leader about <mark>climate change</mark> and its impact. Look at the severity in temperatures in growing seasons, moisture levels, etc. The swings will become more extremes and significant in the years ahead as a result of <mark>climate change</mark>. We are looking at the scenario and what it means for our corn, wheat and soya. Where will be they grown, what <mark>climate</mark> will be hostile and which will be friendly? We are spending considerable time on the impact of it on food economy. <STRONG>Do you think genetically modified crops could be the solution?</STRONG> That’s a very timely question. GM crops are a solution to and tool to sustainability to help meditate the impact of <mark>climate change</mark>. In the US the debate is on GM and it is not only of labelling but there is a misconception that GM food is harmful. It’s a controversial topic in most countries, particularly in the US. <STRONG>So do you think India should adopt it?</STRONG> I think the Indian population is well informed and educated about the benefits of GM crop relatively to sustainability and responsible agriculture practices. <STRONG>How do you see your domestic business in edible oil, grains and animal feed?</STRONG> It’s doing well. It is our core business — the edible oils. But I don’t think we will be investing as much capital as we did earlier. You can imagine there are some countries in the world where we are not investing any new capital and where things are very volatile, but that is not the case in India. So we have been putting substantial money in the past couple of years in India. <STRONG>India is very uncompetitive in global commodity market compared to Brazil and Argentina. What are the reasons?</STRONG> Argentina and Brazil have been consistently investing in agriculture infrastructure at a faster pace than India. Those countries are consistently investing in agriculture infrastructure from ports to river ways — ways to get products to market and onto the world market. That is a challenge for India. Currency competitiveness is also another reason, but the Brazilian real is also very weak. <STRONG>What are your thoughts on Iran?</STRONG> It’s step by step. I think it remains to be seen to what trade moderation with Iran takes place, now that sanctions have been lifted. I think it will be a while before you see open trade relations. It’s my opinion. I think it might take another 3-5 years for something to last. What happens in politics in the US, who gets elected also has to be watched. <STRONG>Globally, after making investment in salmon feed business in Norway, chicken facility units in China and new cocoa chocolate unit in Indonesia, what is your focus?</STRONG> We have invested in green field projects significantly in Asia, but I am interested in acquisitions. The challenge is that acquisitions are very expensive as interest rates are low and multiples are very high, so we have to be patient. Our focus will be aqua feed. In agriculture, supply acquisitions are expensive, but we are scouting for acquisition for industrial oil supply. Animal protein and nutrition accounts to 40% of our business, followed by agriculture and food ingredients. We sold our port business last year so we are looking at opportunities in poultry sector. </DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""clearfix sharingBox shareVert bottom"" data-share_msid=""50735672""><DIV class=""flt comment_count"" onclick=""commentBox.show(50735672);"" data-msid=""50735672""><SPAN>0</SPAN>Comments

The lawsuits, filed by Democratic Party politicians, are part of a larger campaign to address <mark>climate change</mark> in the courts. Worldwide, there are almost 900 lawsuits on <mark>climate change</mark> in 25 countries, a U.N. study said last year.U.S. District Judge William Alsup invited both sides to a hearing on Wednesday to describe their views on &quot;the best science now available on global warming, glacier melt, sea rise, and coastal flooding.&quot;Since U.S. President <A href=""https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/donald+trump"">Donald Trump</A> took office 14 months ago, domestic policy on <mark>climate change</mark> has been turned on its head. Republican Trump has pushed to increase production of fossil fuels and ordered a broad reversal of <mark>climate</mark> regulations. He said last year that he was withdrawing the <A href=""https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/united+states"">United States</A> from the Paris Agreement to reduce emissions but Washington has not disengaged from it completely.Alsup, who has presided over high profile technology cases including one between Alphabet's Waymo and Uber Technologies Inc over self-driving cars, is known to ask blunt questions from the bench.Chevron attorney Avi Garbow on Tuesday told reporters the company will tell the judge it agrees with the scientific consensus that it is extremely likely human influence is the cause of warming. It is unclear whether the other companies will agree with that view.Representatives for the other four companies could not immediately be reached. All of the oil companies generally acknowledge that greenhouse gasses are a contributor to <mark>climate change</mark>. However, the companies argued in court papers on Tuesday that they should not be held liable for global warming, which is caused by &quot;billions&quot; of parties and &quot;complex environmental phenomena occurring worldwide over many decades.&quot;</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""embedgroup storyrelatedcontent clearfix  hide""><H3>RELATED</H3></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,1.0,Neutral

I stress here the word, “known”, as statisticians are able to say that, as there are trillions of planets in the universe, millions of them must support life. We also know of many planets, orbiting stars, which are said to be, “Goldilocks” planets, as they are, as Goldilocks would say, just right. But they are only just right as far as the position and size go, for liquid water, and surface gravity, as we have no idea, really, whether they could support life, or not. Add into these uncertainties, the fact that the nearest star is 4 light years away, which is approximately 24 trillion miles, and all of these, so-called, “Goldilocks planets”, are much further away than that. The nearest is about 12 light years away. Our current methods of space travel, allow speeds of around 160,000 mph, using  gravitational slingshots, but by rockets alone, can only reach around 30,000 mph. It would take about 15,000 years to get to even the nearest star, by current technology, making those “Goldilocks” planets as much of a fairy-tale as the original story.</P><P align=""justify"">So let’s focus on the real story, which is our own little planet Earth , which, as I said, is the only planet in the universe known to be able to support life, and the only home we have. On the Earth we have just the right temperature. Our position relative to the sun should make the Earth a relatively cold planet, an ice planet, rather than the blue planet we know today. During the ice age it was a cold planet, and what we believe ended that was a change in the Earth’s atmosphere through volcanic activity, which caused more of the Sun’s radiant energy to be retained. So, now, we have the right temperature, just about the right amount of water, and land, just the right solid composition, and at this distance from the sun, we have just the right atmosphere. This is an atmosphere just right for both us, and plants, to symbiotically coexist, in the constant exchange of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, and oxygen between us. The Earth has just the right humidity, and the right conditions for rainfall. It has the magnetic field that prevents the solar wind from blowing our atmosphere away. We have the ozone layer which protects us from savage levels of ultraviolet radiation. So, all of this is just right, as Goldilocks would say, and the Earth is really the only planet we can say, with any certainty, is “The Goldilocks planet”.</P><H5 align=""justify"">Life and Water</H5><P align=""justify"">The conditions for the survival of life on this planet are so precarious and unusual that our existence is something of a miracle. Look at the behaviour of water, for example. We all learn at school that as things get colder they contract, and having the same mass, are therefore more dense. Water behaves in the same way, but when it reaches 4°C, it starts to expand again, and become less dense, so that the solid form of water, ice, is less dense than the water, and floats on the top of it. In the winter, instead of the coldest water falling to the bottom and freezing at the bottom, it is the water at 4°C that falls to the bottom, so ice, which is less dense, forms on the top. This allows aquatic creatures to survive in the liquid water at the bottom. So, if it were not for the peculiar behaviour of water, aquatic life and therefore, possibly, life on land, would not have been possible. This just adds to all those other things I have mentioned, the ozone layer, the magnetic field, and so on, without which, our life would not be possible, and which make this planet Earth so unique.</P><H5 align=""justify"">The Tree of Knowledge, and The Garden of Eden</H5><P align=""justify"">In the past few hundred years there has been a great evolution in awareness, of the nature of our planet. Prior to Copernicus and Galileo people thought that the Earth was at the very centre of the entire universe, and even that the Earth was the entire universe, with the sun and moon being lights put into the sky by God for the convenience of mankind. The stars were merely fairy lights to decorate the night sky for our amusement. It was a very comforting picture, and that we, like little children on our playground, were being looked over by the great Father God, to see that all was well, and no harm could come to us.</P><P align=""justify"">Since the time it was accepted that Copernicus, and Galileo, were correct, and that the Earth travels around the sun, we have made more and more startling discoveries about the nature of the universe, and now know that the Earth is no more than a speck of dust in a boiling cauldron of chaos. If cosmologists are correct, eventually the stars will all fade, one by one, and the universe will become an infinite, lifeless, expanse of nothingness, and darkness, enduring for ever. This is all quite a dramatic shift of perspective for us to have to face, and, just as in the Garden of Eden, eating from the Tree of Knowledge has cast us out from childlike innocence, to an adulthood, full of insecurity, and uncertainty.</P><H5 align=""justify"">Grown-up Responsibilities, and Challenges</H5><P align=""justify"">We know that the conditions for the survival of life on this planet are so precarious and unusual that our life is much more of a miracle than it seemed, even in those comforting days when we thought the Earth was our playground, permanent, safe, and secure. We now have to understand that the continuance of life on this planet is our responsibility, and considering the supreme idiocy, carelessness, and ignorance, displayed by so many, the thought that our survival depends on all people, and nations, cooperating is a scary thought.</P><P align=""justify"">There are known hazards that we will have to deal with sometime in the future. We might, or might not, survive the merging of the Milky Way galaxy with Andromeda, which is hurtling towards us. At some time in the future, all the hydrogen in the sun will have been converted to helium, at which point the precarious balance between gravity, and the explosive outpourings of energy from the sun, will shift to allow an expansion, and our Sun will become a red giant, and our little planet Earth, a glowing ember inside the Sun’s outer atmosphere. Before that, the Earth’s core might cease to generate the magnetic field, which protects us from the ferocious solar wind emanating from the Sun, and all our atmosphere might be swept away. Before that, super-volcanoes, such as at Yellowstone national park in the USA might erupt, filling the atmosphere with ash, and blotting out the sun’s warmth for months.</P><H5 align=""justify"">Rocks in Space</H5><P align=""justify"">In the 18th C, when scientists thought that planetary motion worked just like their clockwork models, with perfect spheres moving in perfect circles, in perfectly empty space, the idea that shooting stars might be pieces of space rock burning up in the atmosphere, was refuted by the bland statement, by the French Scientist, Antoine <EM>Lavoisier</EM>, “Stones cannot fall from the sky, because there are no stones in the sky.” This is a good illustration of how we tend to impose our concepts upon reality, and refuse to see what is in front of our faces. Now we know that there are countless millions of rocks, hurtling about in space, and the Earth could be struck by one at any time, with catastrophic consequences. There are people monitoring all those near-Earth objects, but, so far, we have not come up with any concerted effort to ensure that we would be able to do anything about any one of them being on a collision course with our planet.</P><H5 align=""justify"">Initiative Test</H5><P align=""justify"">Although there are so many hazards in the future there is one hazard that is with us right now, and if there were a Father God, it is just the sort of thing they might have come up with as an initiative test, a kind of easy one to start with, to see if mankind is capable of co-operating, and working together, in a rational way, to overcome a simple problem, before we have to go on to survive much more difficult problems in the future. So, how are we doing? Not very well I fear.</P><H5 align=""justify"">When Did we First Know About Global Warming?</H5><P align=""justify"">Beginning with work by Joseph Fourier in the 1820s, scientists had understood that gases in the atmosphere might trap the heat received from the Sun. As Fourier said,</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px"" align=""justify"">“Energy in the form of visible light from the Sun easily penetrates the atmosphere to reach the surface and heat it up, but heat cannot so easily escape back into space, for the air absorbs invisible heat rays, (‘infra-red radiation’), rising from the surface.”</P><P align=""justify"">The warmed air radiates some of the energy back down to the surface, helping it stay warm. This would later be called the “greenhouse effect.”</P><P align=""justify"">In 1859, the Irish physicist, John Tyndall, demonstrated that some gases have the ability to absorb radiant heat, so explaining, and confirming, the greenhouse effect. Tyndall set out to find which, if any, gases in the atmosphere could absorb radiant heat. He identified several gases that did so, including water vapour, and <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (<mark>CO2</mark>).</P><P align=""justify"">Svante Arrhenius was a Swedish scientist who was the first to claim, in 1896, that burning fossil fuels might cause global warming. He hypothesised a correlation between <mark>CO2</mark> concentrations in the atmosphere and temperature. He believed that the average surface temperature of the earth is about 15°C because of the capacity of water vapour and <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide to absorb radiant heat. This he called the greenhouse effect. Arrhenius suggested a doubling of the <mark>CO2</mark> concentration would lead to a 5°C temperature rise. He, and Thomas Chamberlin, calculated that human activities would warm the Earth by adding <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide to the atmosphere.</P><P align=""justify"">In 1938, G.S. Callendar argued that concentrations of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide were increasing and raising global temperature. By the 1950s most scientists accepted the idea of global warming, and believed that <mark>CO2</mark> plays a crucial role in <mark>climate change</mark>, so that rising levels would have significant consequences.</P><P align=""justify"">In 1959 the Physicist, Teller, gave a warning to the US Oil Industry that burning fossil fuels could cause global warming. <A href=""https://cleantechnica.com/2018/01/03/edward-teller-warned-oil-industry-<mark>carbon</mark>-dioxide-<mark>climate</mark>-change-6-decades-ago/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">(See CleanTechnica Article)</A></P><P align=""justify"">He said –</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P style=""text-align: justify"">Whenever you burn conventional fuel, you create <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide. [….] The <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide is invisible, it is transparent, you can’t smell it, it is not dangerous to health, so why should one worry about it? <mark>Carbon</mark> dioxide has a strange property. It transmits visible light but it absorbs the infra-red radiation which is emitted from the Earth. Its presence in the atmosphere causes a greenhouse effect [….] It has been calculated that a temperature rise corresponding to a 10 per cent increase in <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. All the coastal cities would be covered, and since a considerable percentage of the human race lives in coastal regions, I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.</P><P> </P><P style=""text-align: justify"">At present the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere has risen by 2 per cent over normal. By 1970, it will be perhaps 4 per cent, by 1980, 8 per cent, by 1990, 16 per cent [about 360 parts per million, by Teller’s accounting], if we keep on with our exponential rise in the use of purely conventional fuels. By that time, there will be a serious additional impediment for the radiation leaving the earth. Our planet will get a little warmer. It is hard to say whether it will be 2 degrees Fahrenheit or only 1°, or 5°.</P><P style=""text-align: left"" align=""justify"">But when the temperature does rise by a few degrees over the whole globe, there is a possibility that the ice-caps will start melting and the level of the oceans will begin to rise. Well, I don’t know whether they will cover the Empire State Building or not, but anyone can calculate it, by looking at the map, and noting that the ice-caps over Greenland, and over Antarctica, are perhaps 5,000 feet thick.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">From July 23rd, to the 27th, 1979, a scientific assessment of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, and <mark>climate</mark>, was made, and a report produced at Woods Hole, Massachusetts USA-</P><P align=""justify""><A href=""http://www.ecd.bnl.gov/steve/charney_report1979.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">http://www.ecd.bnl.gov/steve/charney_report1979.pdf</A></P><P align=""justify"">This was a report to the <mark>Climate</mark> Research Board, the Assembly of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and the National Research Council. In that report they stated –</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">For more than a century, we have been aware that changes in the composition of the atmosphere could affect its ability to trap the sun’s energy for our benefit. We now have incontrovertible evidence that the atmosphere is indeed changing, and that we ourselves contribute to the change. Atmospheric concentrations of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide are steadily increasing, and these changes are linked with man’s use of fossil fuels and exploitation of the land. Since <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide plays a significant role in the budget of the atmosphere it is reasonable to suppose that continued increases would affect <mark>climate</mark>.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">In their conclusion they stated –</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">Having examined the principal attempts to simulate the effects of increased atmospheric <mark>CO2</mark> on <mark>climate</mark>, we can assume a rate of increase that would lead to a doubling of airborne concentration at some time in the first half of the 21st-century. From this doubling we can predict a global surface warming of between 2° and 3.5° Celsius. However, it is expected that absorption of heat in the oceans, will initially mitigate the effects of warming, but that warming will eventually turn, and the associated regional climatic changes may well be significant.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">An article appeared in Inside <mark>Climate</mark> News by Neela Banerjee, Lisa Song and David Hasemyer</P><P align=""justify""><U><A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/15092015/exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/15092015/exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming</A></U></P><P align=""justify"">In the article they say –</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">In July 1977, at a meeting in Exxon Corporation’s headquarters, a senior company scientist named James F. Black delivered a sobering message: <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide from the world’s use of fossil fuels would warm the planet and could eventually endanger humanity.</P><P align=""justify"">In 1978, he warned Exxon scientists and managers that independent researchers estimated a doubling of the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (<mark>CO2</mark>) concentration in the atmosphere would increase average global temperatures by 2 to 3 degrees Celsius (4 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit), and as much as 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit) at the poles. Rainfall might get heavier in some regions, and other places might turn to desert.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">The article goes on to say that at first, Exxon responded by launching its own research into <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide from fossil fuels, and its impact on the Earth, but then began to see it mainly as a problem that posed an existential threat to the oil business. Toward the end of the 1980s, <A href=""http://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/sites/default/files/documents/Exxon%20Review%20of%20<mark>Climate</mark>%20Research%20Program%20%281981%29.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><U>Exxon curtailed its <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide research</U></A>. and worked, instead, at the forefront of <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/topic/<mark>climate</mark>-denial"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><mark>climate</mark> denial</A><U>,</U> to create doubt about the reality of global warming. It lobbied against federal and international action to control greenhouse-gas emissions, and helped to erect a vast edifice of misinformation that stands to this day. The millions of dollars Exxon had spent since the 1990s on <mark>climate change</mark> deniers had long surpassed what it had once invested in <mark>climate</mark> science.</P><H5 align=""justify"">Current <mark>Climate Change</mark> Deniers</H5><P align=""justify"">So, here we have it. Though Trump, and his administration, like to pretend that there is no such thing as global warming, that it is all a hoax invented by the Chinese, and have even eradicated all mention of it on government websites, and although the US oil industry, appears to have taken the opportunity to spread misinformation, and doubt, concerning <mark>climate change</mark>, science has been well-established starting from the early part of the 19th century, and there is absolutely no doubt that our <mark>climate</mark> is deteriorating, due to our own activities, and if these activities are not brought under control there is a very real danger that the Earth will no longer be able to support life. It seems extraordinary to me that individuals are willing, and able, to put their short-term economic interests above the continuation of life on Earth, by creating and spreading these false denials of <mark>climate change</mark>. Such is the unfathomable stupidity, and wickedness of some, living amongst us. Equally unfathomable are those who, for no better reason than to inflate their own egos, disseminate these falsehoods, on websites, social media, and comments. They add to the delay of urgent protection for all life on Earth, just so that they can pretend to be members of the inner-circle, with the “insider knowledge” that other mere mortals, including 98% of the worlds <mark>climate</mark> scientists, do not possess.</P><H5 align=""justify"">What We Need to do Now.</H5><P align=""justify"">Had we started to do something about this 50 years ago, we would not need to do much at all right now, and if the politicians had started to actually do something at the time they just started to talk about doing something, the situation would not be as desperate as it is now. So far, despite all the talk, greenhouse gas emissions are still increasing, and to make it worse, the ability of our planet to absorb the greenhouse gas emissions is also being reduced by foolish human activity. Global warming, that has already started, is, itself, causing more greenhouse gas to be released, from the thawing Tundra, for example, so creating a self accelerating process. This is accelerated further by the loss of heat reflective white surfaces at the poles, as the ice melts. All of this makes the need for our intervention very urgent, and our action needs to be immediate, robust, and extensive.</P><P align=""justify"">Every Nation, needs to introduce new legislation today, which will ensure and encourage, investment in, and development of, renewable sources of energy, and which will expedite the installation of what ever renewable energy plant is currently available. They also need to lay definite plans for the phasing out of all fossil fuel burning, as alternatives become available, and to make every effort to make those alternatives available, as soon as possible. This would include fossil fuel burning in power stations, transport, and for domestic, and industrial, space heating, and in manafacturing.</P><P align=""justify"">In the area of transport, this would need measures for encouraging the adoption of electric vehicles, and positively discouraging the use of ICE cars, buses, and trucks. Ships trains, and planes will also need to cease using fossil fuels, and can use biofuels, or where practical be converted to use renewable energy directly. All trains can be electric, as many are already.</P><P align=""justify"">In the area of power generation, extensive use needs to be made of wind generators, both on-shore, and off-shore, solar panels to be installed wherever possible, and sufficient storage installed on the grid to buffer the mismatch between peak production, and peak demand. All other methods of energy harvesting, such as hydro, wave, tidal, and geothermal, need to be developed and utilised as soon as possible, and all the power produced by fossil fuels must be replaced by renewable energy sources at the earliest possible moment.</P><P align=""justify"">For space heating, renewable energy systems are already available, such as solar heat panels, and heat pumps operated by renewable electricity. Air conditioning can also be powered by renewable electricity. It is also possible to produce gas from bio-materials, from otherwise non-productive land. <A href=""https://cleantechnica.com/2017/12/09/rock-star-dale-vince-founder-of-ecotricity-interview/"">(See CleanTechnica Article)</A></P><P align=""justify"">In general, it must be made illegal to seek out any new sources of fossil fuels, or to drill any exploratory well, or mine, to test for the existence of fossil fuel deposits. All current fossil fuel production must cease, and wells and mines decommissioned, as soon as alternative energy sources become available. To put it more simply, all fossil fuels must be left in the ground as soon, and as much, as is practically possible.</P><P align=""justify"">We then need to look at energy efficiency so that the energy we are producing is not wasted. We also need to be conscious of the means by which <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide already in the atmosphere is absorbed. Plants, from microscopic phytoplankton in the ocean, to forest giants, are all absorbing <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, and releasing oxygen, and without this process we could not live. We need to nurture and manage all of the land on the planet, and the oceans, to maximise the total of plant life, and plant health.</P><H5 align=""justify"">Methane – The Other Green-House Gas</H5><P align=""justify"">I have mentioned <mark>CO2</mark> so far, but methane is a much more potent greenhouse gas, and is released into the atmosphere from the following three sources-</P><OL><LI><P align=""justify"">Any rotting organic material, on farms, landfill sites, and occurring naturally in peat bogs, and the like.</P></LI><LI><P align=""justify"">Bovine animals reared for food, of which there are billions of individuals in the world today. They release methane through the mouth, in the process of digestion of plant material.</P></LI><LI><P align=""justify"">Oil and gas wells, from which methane constantly leaks, unless carefully managed.</P></LI></OL><P align=""justify"">It is simply not <mark>sustainable</mark> to continue consuming animals as food, and we all need to stop doing this for environmental, moral, and health reasons. If you must eat meat, eat birds or fishes, or when it comes in, the new “lab” meat. Methane from rotting material needs to be carefully managed, and can be used as a bio-fuel. Methane oxidizing bacteria can be employed to stop methane emissions, but these become decreasingly  effective from temperatures above 20 degrees Celcius. Methane from oil and gas wells will cease, once those wells are decommissioned, and in the meantime, need to be carefully managed. Methane from wells is a fossil fuel, and so should not be used.</P><P align=""justify"">As individuals we need to look at our own lifestyle, to reduce our use of energy and maximise our energy efficiency. This can be by large investments such as photovoltaic cells, wind turbines, electric vehicles, ground source heat pump installations, and home insulation, and also simple, low, or no, cost choices, such as changing what we eat, and how extravagant, or otherwise, we are in our use of energy. People also need to stop voting for irrational politicians like Trump, in the US, and The Tories, in the UK.</P><P align=""justify"">This ends Part I of this article: <A href=""https://evobsession.com/planet-earth-the…e-change-part-ii/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">in Part II</A>, coming soon, I will be talking about the contrast between what we need to do, as laid out above, but in more detail, and what we are actually doing, and the huge gap between what governments say, and what they are actually doing.</P><P align=""justify"">In the meantime you can follow me on <A href=""https://twitter.com/AndyMilesco"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Twitter</A>.</P> </DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,0.0,Neutral

				Waves crash against a seawall along the Embarcadero in San Francisco in 2010.									<P class=""credits"">Eric Risberg / AP</P></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><DIV class=""entry-content single-post-content""><P>SAN FRANCISCO — Outside a courtroom where a much-anticipated court hearing on <mark>climate</mark> science took place on Wednesday is an old photo of San Francisco’s coastline. Dated 1865, it features an area of the city known as North Beach, which back then was covered in ramshackle wooden houses on a sandy slope nuzzled up against the shore. Since then, the coastline has been extended, filled in with sand (<A href=""https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/making-up-ground/"">and most likely boats and other strange things</A>) to stretch several blocks farther into the brackish waters of the San Francisco Bay. A sea wall, <A href=""http://abc7news.com/politics/san-franciscos-cracking-seawall-needs-$250m-makeover/3235921/"">badly in need of repair</A>, keeps the bay at bay.</P><P>That very sea wall is at the heart of the court case — The People of the State of California v. BP P.L.C. et al. — that was the reason for Wednesday’s spectacle. The cities of Oakland and San Francisco are suing the five biggest fossil fuel companies on the planet — BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil and <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> — for <A href=""http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/environment/article206025399.html"">billions of dollars</A> for past damages and to prevent future flooding from sea level rise. Since the companies extracted fuel that altered the planet, the argument goes, they should pay for the consequences. It’s a modern version of “you break it, you buy it.” The oil companies have filed to dismiss the lawsuit on many grounds, including that it’s the government’s job to set and enforce <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide levels — not theirs.</P><P>On Wednesday, no one was yet on trial. <A href=""https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16503076/oracle-vs-google-judge-william-alsup-interview-waymo-uber"">U.S. District Judge William Alsup</A> made that very clear to the throng of spectators who filled the chambers, a spillover courtroom and the halls outside. Instead, we were there to see a tutorial, an effort to help this self-described “poor judge” learn the science behind the case. It was going to be a boring morning full of numbers and diagrams, he warned the audience.</P><P>But in this polarized moment, a public tussling over the basics of <mark>climate</mark> science, however cursory, is anything but boring. And as each side in the case presented a history of <mark>climate change</mark> science, it was striking just how much the two sides agreed on: <mark>Climate change</mark> is happening, and humans are in large part responsible. But that’s not really what this court case is about. Rather, it’s about who knew what and when, how much uncertainty there is around future predictions and who should be held responsible (and liable) for a future with higher seas and more extreme weather events. That’s where the cities’ and corporations’ use of evidence diverged.</P><P>First up: the scientists.</P><P>At a big rectangular table in the center of the room, the cities were represented by Steve Berman, a lawyer known for his ability to <A href=""https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43qw3j/meet-the-lawyer-trying-to-make-big-oil-pay-for-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">get big settlements out of big corporations</A>, as well as some of their own lawyers. But aside from a few introductory remarks, Berman left the talking to a few of the world’s leading experts on <mark>climate change</mark>. First, he called Myles Allen, who is a professor of geosystem science at Oxford University and was tasked with providing a historiography of <mark>climate change</mark> research.</P><P>In true scientist fashion, the talk was filled with jargon and complicated scientific concepts. Alsup, who made clear that he would call out confusing charts or unclear explanations, asked Allen what made <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, which is emitted from burning fossil fuels and have led to a warming planet, special. Allen, equal to the task, began to pantomime his answer. Arms stretched out to the side, fists in a ball, he shimmied left and right, showing how the charge on a <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide molecule could be unevenly distributed, absorbing the infrared waves that are naturally emitted from Earth, unlike oxygen and nitrogen, whose charge is symmetric. That infrared gets trapped within Earth’s atmosphere, instead of escaping, causing the planet to warm.</P><P>After walking through key figures and research from the last century of <mark>climate</mark> science, Allen concluded by saying that we’ve known that the planet was warming since the 1970s. And crucially, he said, we knew back then that we might not know how bad <mark>climate change</mark> would be, or be able to feel and see the effects of that warming, until it was already too late.</P><P>The next speaker, Gary Griggs, an oceanographer who works at the University of California, Santa Cruz, was deep into an explanation of sea level rise when a loud, piercing alarm went off. “Coastal flood alert,” Alsup quipped as soon as it finished. The room broke out in laughter. It wasn’t clear whether it was real or a drill, but nature has a way of making itself known.</P><P>Next up: the lawyers.</P><P>While the cities relied on scientists, the energy companies relied on lawyers. One in particular: Theodore Boutrous, a lawyer for Chevron (which is headquartered in the Bay Area) did all of the talking. And he got straight to the point, answering the question on everyone’s mind: Yes, Chevron accepts the scientific consensus on <mark>climate change</mark>. And in honor of that consensus, he’d be relying almost entirely on the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, a United Nations-backed consortium meant to provide a scientific view of what <mark>climate change</mark> is doing to the planet, to lay out his understanding of the science and the history.</P><P>He kicked off by quoting from the IPCC’s <A href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/"">most recent report</A>, from 2013, citing population growth and economic changes as the most important drivers of <mark>climate change</mark>. The report, he noted, says nothing about fossil-fuel extraction as a driver of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Boutrous offered a history lesson that had a lot in common with Allen’s, but with a much greater focus on the uncertainty around both the science and the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on the Bay Area. He illustrated that uncertainty in various ways, describing how theories that posited alternative roles of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere held sway through at least the 1950s. Boutros also showed how actual temperatures hadn’t been as extreme as many <mark>climate</mark> forecasts predicted in the years leading up to the report. Alsup asked if his point was that the models exaggerated the impact of humans on the <mark>climate</mark>. “Instead of doom and gloom, it’s just gloom?” he asked the lawyer. Boutrous chuckled and moved on.</P><P>Boutrous concluded by showing a map of sea level rise, saying that sea levels had fallen around San Francisco in the years leading up to the 2013 IPCC report. There’s a lot of uncertainty about the future, he concluded, noting that San Francisco and Oakland had reported that <A href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/california-municipalities-debt-disclosures-contrast-with-<mark>climate</mark>-warnings-1515456551"">exact message to bond investors</A> in 2017, when the cities said they couldn’t predict whether major flooding or storms might have a major, adverse impact on the local economy.</P><P>Finally, the tutorial pivoted back to the cities, so it pivoted back to the scientists. Don Wuebbles, who is a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Illinois and co-wrote the 2007 IPCC report that helped the organization win the Nobel Peace Prize, was the final scientist called by the cities. He began by pointing out that he’d also led the writing of the first chapter in the 2013 IPCC report that Boutrous had so carefully recounted. “I think it’s important to recognize that science did not stop; there’s a lot we’ve learned in the last five years,” Wuebbles said. That’s why he’d be using <A href=""https://science2017.globalchange.gov/"">data from the U.S. Global Change Research Program</A>, which produces more frequent, national reports on <mark>climate change</mark> to make his presentation.</P><P>The year after the most recent IPCC report was published was the hottest on record, Wuebbles told the court. Then 2015 topped 2014, and 2016 topped 2015. Temperatures are going up, precipitation is increasing, extreme events are more frequent. Looking at a broader set of years, sea level has risen around the San Francisco Bay. Alsup asked Wuebbles whether he disagreed with Boutrous’s recounting of the science.</P><P>Not really, since the lawyer had based his presentation on the IPCC, and a report that Wuebbles was heavily involved with. But Wuebbles’s point was that the IPCC report doesn’t tell all of what we know in 2018. The IPCC report might not be wrong, but that doesn’t mean that it gives the best picture of what’s right.</P><P>As the tutorial concluded, Alsup had a few final remarks. “I wore my science tie today,” he said, pointing to the solar system hanging around his neck before standing up to leave. “I hope someone takes note of that.”</P></DIV></ARTICLE><DIV class=""mini-bio""><P>Anna Maria Barry-Jester reports on public health, food and culture for FiveThirtyEight.  <SPAN class=""twitter""><A href=""https://twitter.com/annabarryjester"" target=""_blank""><SPAN class=""twitter-username"">@annabarryjester</SPAN></A></SPAN></P></DIV><DIV class=""tags""><P class=""filed-under"">Filed under</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,1.0,Negative

He described the statement to Parliament on 3<SUP>rd</SUP> October 2017, when Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse MSP announced that the Scottish Government would not support fracking, as a statement of preferred policy, rather than a decision. Since a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) was required in relation to an actual policy decision of this sort, and indeed such an SEA was currently underway, clearly no decision had been made at this stage, therefore the petition was premature and should be refused. Further, when the Minister described the position of the Government as an ‘effective ban’ this was nothing more than ‘a gloss’ – a means of communicating perhaps, but not a fact of law.</P><P>This line of argument could strike at the very heart of the petition according to the judge hearing the case, Lord Pentland, who urged Gerry Moynihan QC for <mark>INEOS</mark> and Reach CSG to consider what remained of their grounds for challenge in light of this fundamental point.</P><P>Should Lord Pentland be persuaded by this argument, the case could potentially be settled on this point alone, avoiding the need to determine the merits of <mark>INEOS</mark> and Reach’s arguments on the 6 grounds of challenge.</P><P>However, were this to transpire, any sense of victory felt by those of us who fought for and support the fracking ban may be short-lived: once the SEA process is complete, and a decision has been finally made, <mark>Ineos</mark> and Reach would be free once again to seek to legally challenge that decision.</P><P>The hearing will start again tomorrow at 10am and has a total of four days scheduled in court.</P><P>*****</P><P>We are making a public interest intervention in the case arguing that the Scottish Government was obliged to ban fracking in order to meet its own legally binding <mark>climate change</mark> commitments.

Therefore, shareholders request Shell to set and publish targets for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that are aligned with the goal of the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2°C.</P><P>These GHG emission reduction targets need to cover Shell’s operations as well as the usage of its products (scope 1, 2, and 3), they need to include medium-term (2030) and long-term (2050) deadlines, and they need to be company-wide, quantitative, and reviewed regularly.</P><P>Shareholders request that annual reporting include further information about plans and progress to achieve these targets.</P><P><STRONG>Supporting Statement</STRONG></P><P>This shareholder resolution is intended to express shareholder support for a course towards a net-zero-emission energy system. The <EM>why</EM> of a course towards a net-zero-emission energy system is clear: increasing costs of the extraction of fossil fuels, decreasing costs of generating renewable energy, and the global political pledge to stop global warming. The <EM>how</EM> and the <EM>what</EM> are up to the management of Shell. It is up to them to set GHG emission reduction targets and to develop activities to attain these targets.</P><P>This supporting statement serves to offer rationale, elaborate on transparency, and recommend metrics to align these targets with the Paris <mark>Climate</mark> Agreement.</P><P><STRONG>Context</STRONG></P><UL><LI>In Paris, in December 2015, during the twenty-first Conference of the Parties (COP21), representatives of 195 countries reaffirmed the goal of limiting global temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and agreed to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. COP21 also agreed to aim for a global net-zero-emission energy system.</LI><LI>In May 2015, by means of a shareholder resolution submitted by the Aiming for A investor coalition, shareholders directed that annual reporting will include information relating to <mark>climate change</mark>, such as emissions management, asset portfolio resilience, and investment strategies. Setting further targets on scopes 1, 2, and 3 is the next step.</LI><LI>Major institutional investors have announced that they will drastically cut the <mark>carbon</mark> footprint of their investment portfolios with the aim of reducing the <mark>climate</mark> risks in them.</LI></UL><P><STRONG>Transparency</STRONG></P><P>We the shareholders request that the company publish company-wide greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets according to the following 3 scopes:</P><UL><LI>Scope 1: direct emissions from the facilities under Shell’s operational control or the equity boundary,</LI><LI>Scope 2: indirect emissions from the facilities of others that provide electricity or heat and steam to Shell’s operations,</LI><LI>Scope 3: emissions that Shell estimates come from the use of Shell’s refinery products and natural gas products.</LI></UL><P>In order to align its emission reduction targets with a well-below-2°C pathway, we request the company to base these targets on tangible metrics such as the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), or to use any other metrics the company finds practical to align its targets with a well-below-2°C pathway. For example, the INDC of Europe calls for 40% emission reduction by 2030 and 80-95% by 2050, relative to 1990 levels. While the combined INDCs are not enough to get on a well-below-2°C pathway, these commitments may be ratcheted up. The company could use metrics of the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC) as well. For example, to limit global warming to well below 2°C, the IPCC estimates that 40-70% reduction in GHG emissions globally is needed by 2050, relative to 2010 levels. In the light of changing technological drive, scientific progress, and incrementally rising policy commitments, Shell should review its GHG emission reduction targets regularly.</P><P><STRONG>Risks</STRONG></P><P>If actions to get on a well-below-2°C pathway are taken too slowly, this may lead to abrupt adjustments, resulting in costly shocks. An orderly transition should start with the expression of clear medium- and long-term targets. We fully realize that these targets will be just dots on the horizon and that the road leading there has to be discovered, but the longer the company waits, the harder it will be to attain the well-below-2°C pathway and the more disruptive the transition will be.</P><P>The political pledge to limit <mark>climate change</mark> to well below 2°C, the resulting future legislation, and the decreasing costs of renewable energy add to the risk that capital expenditures in fossil fuel projects will become stranded assets.</P><P><STRONG>Opportunities</STRONG></P><P>Taking leadership in the global energy transition could increase the brand value of Shell. The company could distinguish itself from its competitors if customers knew that part of the profits from fossil fuels would be invested in energy sources that limit global warming.</P><P>Shell is accustomed to exploring for oil and gas resources. We encourage the company to explore new business models. Some investments will turn out to be profitable; some not, as is the case in the exploration for oil and gas.</P><P>Shell’s financial results greatly depend on the price of oil. Diversification of the energy system could turn out to be an opportunity to decrease risks and create the cash engines of the future.</P><P><STRONG>Support</STRONG></P><P>We encourage Shell to show leadership by enhancing its capability to innovate and make use of potential opportunities in a transforming energy landscape over the coming decades. We would welcome further alignment between the company’s strategic positions vis-à-vis emerging energy technologies that stand to benefit from the energy transition. With its decades of experience and expertise as an innovator, its global reach, its financial capital, and its human capital, Shell is excellently positioned to make use of these developments by applying new technologies and setting up related business models. We encourage Shell to set targets that are inspirational for society, employees, and shareholders, allowing Shell to meet increasing demand for energy while reducing GHG emissions.</P><P><STRONG>You have our support.</STRONG></P></DIV><DIV class=""fusion-sharing-box share-box""><H4>Deel dit verhaal, kies uw platform!</H4></DIV><DIV class=""related-posts single-related-posts""><DIV class=""fusion-title title""><H2 class=""title-heading-left"">Gerelateerde berichten</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,2.0,Neutral

          </DIV><DIV class=""foe-page-copy""><P>Rotherham Borough Council planners today rejected the application by chemicals giant <mark>INEOS</mark> to conduct exploratory drills for shale gas near the village of Harthill in South Yorkshire, to the delight of campaigners.</P><P>This decision shows that industry plans can be frustrated, and that community coordination can result in big wins. Campaigners will be bolstered by today’s news, and people in other areas where exploratory drilling is proposed will also claim this as a victory against the industry – though the fight is not yet over with an Inquiry pending.</P><P>This is the first application for exploratory drilling by <mark>INEOS</mark> to be considered by a local planning committee in England. The company has ambitious plans [1] to drill numerous fracking wells across the Midlands and North of England. <mark>INEOS</mark> has also applied to conduct test drills near Eckington (Derbyshire) and Woodsetts (also in Rotherham) - both within 10 miles of the Harthill site and due to be considered by local planners shortly.</P><P><mark>INEOS</mark> has recently applied to the Planning Inspectorate for the Eckington and Harthill applications to be decided by a government appointed planning inspector because it believes “no local decisions have been made in a reasonable time period” [2]. Today’s decision by Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council is an important consideration for the planning inspector in the planning inquiry which could take place as early as May. Rotherham MBC officers had recommended that Councillors reject the planning application at today’s hearing.</P><P>Deborah Gibson, campaigner with Harthill Against Fracking, said:</P><P>“This is excellent news for Harthill! The much bigger fight against the development of fracking here and in other surrounding areas, has received a boost today. It means that local democratic processes have allowed the people of Harthill to say NO and to be heard and validated by the local planning system. The next step is to take our fight to the Public Inquiry later this year. We hope the inspector will understand that the plans for fracking exploration site at Harthill are unacceptable for all the reasons stated today by the RMBC Planning Committee”.</P><P>Richard Dyer, campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said:</P><P>“It’s great that today Rotherham planners have listened to local community concerns and rightly decided that the impacts of this proposal would be damaging and unacceptable. We now look forward to supporting the Council’s position at the public inquiry.”</P><P>“We know that we have to leave the majority of fossil fuel resources in the ground if we are to prevent dangerous <mark>climate change</mark>, so it makes absolutely no sense to investigate the potential for fracking.”</P><P>Dave Kesteven, campaigner with Eckington Against Fracking, said:</P><P>“I’m absolutely delighted that the council have decided to support those who elect them and not a multinational plastics manufacturer whose activities would disrupt our communities and pollute our environment.</P><P>&quot;I am sure that this victory will be repeated at the public inquiry and sets a heartening precedent for our village of Marsh Lane which is fighting a similar threat.”</P><P>Andy Tickle, director of CPRE South Yorkshire, said:</P><P>&quot;We are pleased that the Council's Planning Board has decided that drilling in this sensitive location is inappropriate and that the impacts were not fully evaluated. We will be strongly supporting the Council at the public inquiry that will now be held to decide the application.&quot;</P><P>Harthill Against Fracking, Friends of the Earth and CPRE spoke at the planning hearing at Rotherham Town Hall this afternoon. They are available for broadcast interviews.</P><P>Notes: 1. <A href=""https://www.<mark>ineos</mark>.com/news/shared-news/<mark>ineos</mark>-adds-to-shale-gas-licence-portfolio/""><mark>INEOS</mark> owns </A>1.2million acres of PEDLs (Petroleum Exploration and Development Licences) across the UK and announced in 2014 that it wants to be the <A href=""https://www.<mark>ineos</mark>.com/businesses/<mark>ineos</mark>-shale/news/<mark>ineos</mark>-moves-to-become-biggest-player-in-the-uk-shale-gas-industry/"">biggest player </A>in the UK fracking industry.</P><P>2.

American company ExxonMobil lost its status as the world's largest energy
company, which it retained for 12 years. On the first place in the list was the
Russian concern &quot;<mark>Gazprom</mark>&quot;, the second - the German energy company
E.ON.</SPAN></P><P class=""MsoNormal""><SPAN lang=""EN-US"">According
to the new annual rating of Platts, the largest energy company in the world was
the Russian <mark>Gazprom</mark>, and Exxon Mobil, which previously headed the rating,
dropped to the 9th position.</SPAN></P><P class=""MsoNormal""><SPAN lang=""EN-US"">&quot;In
the conditions that we had in the past year, companies like ExxonMobil and
Chevron, which are prone to commodity price risks, have fallen predictably in
the ranking compared to those companies that have government guarantees of
profit,&quot; an economist from the University told Platts Houston Edward Hears.</SPAN></P><P class=""MsoNormal""><SPAN lang=""EN-US"">According
to Platts analysts, the volatility of prices for hydro<mark>carbon</mark> raw materials,
geopolitical shifts and consolidation of industry forced investors to look for
companies with a high return on their invested capital, which operate under
long-term fixed tariffs, the stability of state regulation and unhindered
access to regional markets.</SPAN></P><P class=""MsoNormal""><SPAN lang=""EN-US"">In spite of
the fact that integrated oil and gas companies continue to occupy high
positions in the list of the largest energy companies, they have been replaced
by electric power companies and network operators. The second in the ranking
was the German company E.ON, whose business is now focused on renewable energy
sources and electric power infrastructure. Thanks to the new development
strategy, E.ON company quickly rose to the top rating from 114th position,
which it occupied a year earlier.</SPAN></P><P class=""MsoNormal""><SPAN lang=""EN-US"">Changes in
the Platts rating reflect fundamental shifts in the energy sector that became
irreversible after the adoption of the Paris Agreement on <mark>Climate Change</mark>
Prevention, when a number of states and large corporations within the framework
of the RE100 initiative assumed voluntary commitments to switch to 100%
renewable energy sources to stop using Fossil fuels and rapidly reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.</SPAN></P><P class=""MsoNormal""><SPAN lang=""EN-US"">The Platts
news agency is part of the US publishing group McGraw-Hill and specializes in
publications on the energy sector and industry information on price quotations
for oil, oil products, natural gas, petrochemical products and industrial
metals in various regions of the world.</SPAN></P><P class=""MsoNormal""><SPAN lang=""EN-US"">Annually
Platts makes a rating of 250 largest power companies in the world. All
companies on the list have assets of at least 5.5 billion US dollars.
Participants of the rating are assessed on profit, asset value, revenue and
financial returns from capital investments.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>

Another company called <A href=""https://futurism.com/are-lab-grown-meats-really-the-future-of-food/"" target=""_blank"">Beyond Meat</A> is also proving the concept’s worth by creating great-tasting food without live animals, which require a lot of resources to properly house and raise.</P><P><A href=""https://futurism.com/researchers-unveiled-the-first-chicken-meat-grown-without-chickens/"" target=""_blank"">Memphis Meats already produces chicken</A>, beef, and duck from animal cells, forgoing the need to use live animals, and intends to use their new funding to add to the range of food it produces. It also plans to improve upon various aspects of its business, including faster food production and reduced production costs.</P><H2>More Lab Chicken, Less Gas Emission</H2><P>“The world loves to eat meat, and it is core to many of our cultures and traditions,” said Memphis Meats co-founder and CEO Uma Valeti <A href=""http://www.memphismeats.com/s/Memphis-Meats-Press-Release-23-Aug-2017-vFF-nefe.pdf"" target=""_blank"">in a press release</A>. “Meat demand is growing rapidly around the world. We want the world to keep eating what it loves. However, the way conventional meat is produced today creates challenges for the environment, animal welfare and human health.”<FIGURE style=""width: 360px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text center""><STRONG><A href=""https://futurism.com/images/highrises-and-labs-may-be-the-farms-of-the-future/"" target=""_blank"">Click to View Full Infographic</A></STRONG></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></P><P>A <mark>climate change</mark> report published by the WorldWatch Institute earlier this year claimed animal agriculture accounts for <A href=""https://futurism.com/researchers-unveiled-the-first-chicken-meat-grown-without-chickens/"" target=""_blank"">nearly 51 percent of gas emissions</A>. Meat production alone uses about a third of our planet’s fresh water and land.

The thing to take away here is this: <mark>climate change</mark> continues to be huge issue, and shifting to lab-grown meat would go a long way in addressing this serious antagonism.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1.0,1.0,Neutral

Comte fell into fashion photography when, in 1980, Karl Lagerfeld asked the then 25-year-old to shoot a Chloé campaign. Since then, he’s worked with Givenchy, Nike, <mark>BMW</mark>, Hennessy, and many others, and photographed Jeremy Irons, Mike Tyson, Miles Davis, Helena Christensen, Naomi Campbell, Louise Bourgeois, and Sharon Stone. Before, during, and after this era of editorial and commercial work, however, the Swiss artist developed—and continues to explore—another interest: <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>Now Rome museum <A href=""http://www.maxxi.art/en/"" target=""_blank"">The Maxxi</A> is hosting Comte’s never-before-seen series <I> Light</I>. An avid mountaineer, the artist has spent more than 30 years documenting the rapid changes of glacial landscapes, from the Himalayas to Mount Kilimanjaro. In the exhibition, viewers will confront environmental flashpoints in close-up images of pristine, silvery landscapes that look like the products of Photoshop manipulation. Also on show are sculptures, installations, and projections. And later this month, he’ll also present <I> Black Light</I><I>, White Light</I> an expansion of <I> Light</I>, at the <A href=""http://www.triennale.org/en/"" target=""_blank"">Triennale di Milano</A>. </P><P>Above: The exterior of The Maxxi, National Museum of the 21st Century Arts, Rome, with a projection of Michael Comte's <I>Light. </I>Video mapping by Manuel Savoia. Courtesy of Michel Comte<B>GARAGE: I read that you stopped doing commercial photography to focus on </B><I> Light</I><B> a little less than ten years ago.</B><B>Michel Comte:</B> I stopped most of my commercial work in 2009, but this project began much longer ago. My grandfather was one of Swissair’s three founders. His co-pilot took the very first series of photographs of the Swiss glaciers in 1914, and my grandfather and I looked at pictures from that period when I was growing up. I was also an active mountaineer until an accident in the French mountains in which my best friend was killed as we were hiking together. After that, I kept climbing, but not extreme climbing, and I began to record the mountain landscapes, in particular the glaciers.</P><DIV class=""article__media""><PICTURE class=""article__image""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 25em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612852663-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-MC_STM_DAY1_HELI_LAKE_470.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612852663-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-MC_STM_DAY1_HELI_LAKE_470.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 40.625em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612852663-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-MC_STM_DAY1_HELI_LAKE_470.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612852663-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-MC_STM_DAY1_HELI_LAKE_470.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 53.125em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612852663-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-MC_STM_DAY1_HELI_LAKE_470.jpeg?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612852663-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-MC_STM_DAY1_HELI_LAKE_470.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 65.625em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612852663-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-MC_STM_DAY1_HELI_LAKE_470.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612852663-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-MC_STM_DAY1_HELI_LAKE_470.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x""><DIV class=""article__image-caption"">From Michael Comte's <I>Light</I>, 2017. The K2 region of the Himalayas</DIV></SOURCE></SOURCE></SOURCE></SOURCE></PICTURE></DIV><P><B> So your interest in environmentalism must’ve predated your fashion work. How did <I> Light</I>, specifically, come about?</B> In 1975, before even starting university, I wrote an essay about the limits of growth called “Water Is the Oil of the Future” and was invited to speak in front of <A href=""https://www.clubofrome.org/"" target=""_blank"">The Club of Rome</A>, one of the first organizations concerned about the environment. Then, in 1986, I spent a year in the Tibetan Himalayas. I met a group of Chinese scientists at a very remote monastery and we talked about water. They told me: “The reason China is in Tibet has nothing to do with the Dalai Lama or religion. The Chinese are here because Tibet is the water reserve for China’s future.” These scientists predicted a great ice melt between the years 2005 and 2010. </P><P>I returned to Switzerland and found scientific data that confirmed the glaciers were retreating 20 centimeters a year. This intrigued me and it’s why I decided to inspect all of the glaciers in the Himalayas over a period of two years. What I discovered was shocking. I went to one glacier and a year later 50 <I> meters</I> were lost, not 20 centimeters. I went to another glacier and, in one year, we lost 300 meters. I went to British Columbia and climbed Mount Kilimanjaro; there was no snow in some places. I thought to myself, “Wow, we really have a problem,” and that was how this project was born.</P><DIV class=""article__media""><PICTURE class=""article__image""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 25em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612898710-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-R0010395.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612898710-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-R0010395.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 40.625em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612898710-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-R0010395.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612898710-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-R0010395.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 53.125em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612898710-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-R0010395.jpeg?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612898710-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-R0010395.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 65.625em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612898710-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-R0010395.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612898710-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-R0010395.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x""><DIV class=""article__image-caption"">From Michael Comte's <I>Light</I>, 2017.

Between 1996 and 2001, I contributed to the construction of the orthopedic center in Kabul. I was part of the International Red Cross committee for many years.

Fog in the K2 region</DIV></SOURCE></SOURCE></SOURCE></SOURCE></PICTURE></DIV><P><B> At what point did you also become interested in film, sculpture, and installation?</B>I became interested in different kinds of art at a very early age. In the 1970s, I was in the States and went to the Mohave Desert where I saw Michael Heizer’s <I> Double Negative. </I>I also liked the stone pieces that [Joseph] Beuys did and I was very taken by Robert Smithson’s <I> Spiral Jetty </I>and Walter De Maria’s <I> Lightning Field.</I> I was also a producer of <I> Trouble Makers </I>(<I>The Story of Land Art</I>), a film by James Crump. I’ve always been obsessed with land art as a form of contemporary art, and <I> Light </I>is extremely related to this.</P><P><B> What prompted you to leave fashion behind and focus on art?</B> You know, I don’t like retrospectives. I get tired of the same questions being asked over and over. I especially disliked the stigma of being a “star photographer.” It was always the worst thing anyone could ever call me. I never ever felt I was working with stars. My relationships with many of the people I worked with lasted 25 to 30 years. People like Louise Bourgeois, Jeremy Irons, Ben Kingsley, Sophia Loren, and William Defoe, for me, were not only celebrities; they were so much more. When an assignment had a celebrity angle, it had to be fascinating in a strange way, like Sharon Stone—those pictures were mad. </P><P>This “star” stigma is one of the things I’ve been working to get rid of. It was very difficult and involved building new relationships with galleries and museums based on a very different perception of me and my work. I am now working with great museums that give me creative freedom and <A href=""https://galerieursmeile.com/contemporary-chinese-art-beijing-china-lucerne-switzerland.html"" target=""_blank"">Galerie Urs Meile</A>, Beijing, represents my work worldwide. So it has been an unusual path, it’s taken a lot of hard work, and I’ve had to invest a lot of time and money, but I do it because I am passionate about contemporary art—and about my subject.</P><DIV class=""article__media""><PICTURE class=""article__image""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 25em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612705691-michel-comte_light_2017_0014138.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612705691-michel-comte_light_2017_0014138.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 40.625em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612705691-michel-comte_light_2017_0014138.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612705691-michel-comte_light_2017_0014138.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 53.125em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612705691-michel-comte_light_2017_0014138.jpeg?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612705691-michel-comte_light_2017_0014138.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 65.625em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612705691-michel-comte_light_2017_0014138.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612705691-michel-comte_light_2017_0014138.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x""><DIV class=""article__image-caption"">From Michael Comte's <I>Light</I>, 2017.

As CEO in what were arguably <mark>IBM</mark>’s darkest hours, Gerstner brought the company back from the brink. After nearly ten wrenching years, in which the big-machine manufacturer remade itself into a comprehensive software, hardware, and services provider, business was looking good. So the challenge for Sam Palmisano, when he took over as CEO in 2002, was to come up with a mandate for a second act in the company’s transformation.</P><P>His primary aim was to get different parts of the company working together so <mark>IBM</mark> could offer customers “integrated solutions”—hardware, software, services, and financing—at a single price. As part of this effort, he asked all of <mark>IBM</mark>’s 320,000 employees, in 170 countries, to weigh in on a new set of shared corporate values.</P><P>Over a 72-hour period, thousands of <mark>IBM</mark>ers throughout the world gave Palmisano and his executive team an earful in an intranet discussion dubbed “ValuesJam,” an often-heated debate about the company’s heart and soul. Twenty-four hours into the exercise, at least one senior exec wanted to pull the plug. The jam had clearly struck a chord with employees, but it was a dissonant one, full of rancor and discontent.</P><P>Palmisano let the discussion continue, and the next day, the mood began to shift. The criticism became more constructive. Out of the million words generated by the jam grew a set of values that, as Palmisano explains in this interview, are meant to guide the operational decisions made by <mark>IBM</mark>’s employees—and, more important, to serve as Palmisano’s mandate to continue the reinvention of the company.</P></DIV><DIV class=""article article-first-row premium""><DIV class=""interview-intro""><P>In July 2003, International Business Machines Corporation conducted a 72-hour experiment whose outcome was as uncertain as anything going on in its research labs. Six months into a top-to-bottom review of its management organization, <mark>IBM</mark> held a three-day discussion via the corporate intranet about the company’s values. The forum, dubbed ValuesJam, joined thousands of employees in a debate about the very nature of the computer giant and what it stood for.</P><P>Over the three days, an estimated 50,000 of <mark>IBM</mark>’s employees—including CEO Sam Palmisano—checked out the discussion, posting nearly 10,000 comments about the proposed values. The jam had clearly struck a chord.</P><P>But it was a disturbingly dissonant one. Some comments were merely cynical. One had the subject line: “The only value in <mark>IBM</mark> today is the stock price.” Another read, “Company values (ya right).” Others, though, addressed fundamental management issues. “I feel we talk a lot about trust and taking risks. But at the same time, we have endless audits, mistakes are punished and not seen as a welcome part of learning, and managers (and others) are consistently checked,” wrote one employee. “There appears to be a great reluctance among our junior executive community to challenge the views of our senior execs,” said another. “Many times I have heard expressions like, ‘Would you tell Sam that his strategy is wrong!!?’” Twenty-four hours into the exercise, at least one senior executive wanted to pull the plug.</P><P>But Palmisano wouldn’t hear of it. And then the mood began to shift. After a day marked by critics letting off steam, the countercritics began to weigh in. While acknowledging the company’s shortcomings, they argued that much of <mark>IBM</mark>’s culture and values was worth preserving. “Shortly after joining <mark>IBM</mark> 18 years ago,” wrote one, “I was asked to serve on a jury. When I approached the bench and answered [the lawyers’] questions, I was surprised when the judge said, ‘You guys can pick whoever else you want, but <EM>I want this <mark>IBM</mark>er</EM> on that jury.’ I have never felt so much pride. His statement said it all: integrity, excellence, and quality.” Comments like these became more frequent, criticism became more constructive, and the ValuesJam conversation stabilized.</P><P>The question of what was worth preserving and what needed to be changed was at the heart of ValuesJam. In 1914—when the company was making tabulating machines, scales for weighing meat, and cheese slicers—president Thomas Watson, Sr., decreed three corporate principles, called the Basic Beliefs: “respect for the individual,” “the best customer service,” and “the pursuit of excellence.” They would inform <mark>IBM</mark>’s culture, and help drive its success, for more than half a century.</P><P>By 2002, when Palmisano took over as CEO, much had happened to Big Blue. In the early 1990s, the company had suffered the worst reversal in its history and then, under Lou Gerstner, had fought its way back, transformed from a mainframe maker into a robust provider of integrated hardware, networking, and software solutions. Palmisano felt that the Basic Beliefs could still serve the company—but now as the foundation for a new set of corporate values that could energize employees even more than its near-death experience had. Looking for a modern-day equivalent, Palmisano first queried 300 of his senior executives, then quickly opened up the discussion, through a survey of over a thousand employees, to get a sense of how people at all levels, functions, and locations would articulate <mark>IBM</mark>’s values and their aspirations for the company. Out of this research grew the propositions that were debated in ValuesJam.</P><P>After—and even during—the jam, company analysts pored over the postings, mining the million-word text for key themes. Finally, a small team that included Palmisano came up with a revised set of corporate values. The CEO announced the new values to employees in an intranet broadcast in November 2003: “dedication to every client’s success,” “<mark>innovation</mark> that matters—for our company and for the world,” “trust and personal responsibility in all relationships.” Earthshaking? No, but imbued with legitimacy and packed with meaning and implications for <mark>IBM</mark>.</P><P>To prove that the new values were more than window dressing, Palmisano immediately made some changes. He called on the director of a major business unit—e-business hosting services for the U.S. industrial sector—and charged her with identifying gaps between the values and company practices. He bluntly told his 15 direct reports that they had better follow suit. Another online jam was held in October 2004 (this one informally dubbed a “logjam”) in which employees were asked to identify organizational barriers to <mark>innovation</mark> and revenue growth.</P><P>Although Palmisano, by his own account, is building on a strategy laid down by Gerstner, the leadership styles of the two men are very different. Under Gerstner, there was little expansive talk about <mark>IBM</mark>’s heritage. He was an outsider, a former CEO of RJR Nabisco and an ex-McKinsey consultant, who was faced with the daunting task of righting a sinking ship. In fact, he famously observed, shortly after taking over, that “the last thing <mark>IBM</mark> needs right now is a vision.” Palmisano, by contrast, is a true-blue <mark>IBM</mark>er, who started at the company in 1973 as a salesman in Baltimore. Like many of his generation who felt such acute shame when <mark>IBM</mark> was brought to its knees in the early 1990s, he clearly has a visceral attachment to the firm—and to the hope that it may someday regain its former greatness. At the same time, the erstwhile salesman is, in the words of a colleague, “a results-driven, make-it-rain, close-the-deal sort of guy”: not the first person you’d expect to hold forth on a subjective topic like “trust.”</P><P>In this edited conversation with HBR senior editor Paul Hemp and HBR’s editor, Thomas A. Stewart, Palmisano talks about the strategic importance of values to <mark>IBM</mark>. He begins by explaining why—and how—hard financial metrics and soft corporate values can coexist.</P></DIV><P>Corporate values generally are feel-good statements that have almost no effect on a company’s operations. What made—what makes—you think they can be more than this?</P><P>Look at the portrait of Tom Watson, Sr., in our lobby. You’ve never seen such a stern man. The eyes in the painting stare right through you. This was <EM>not</EM> a soft individual. He was a capitalist. He wanted <mark>IBM</mark> to make money, lots of it. But he was perceptive enough to build the company in a way that would ensure its prosperity long after he left the scene. His three Basic Beliefs successfully steered this company through persistent change and repeated reinvention for more than 50 years.</P><P>An organic system, which is what a company is, needs to adapt. And we think values—that’s what we call them today at <mark>IBM</mark>, but you can call them “beliefs” or “principles” or “precepts” or even “DNA”—are what enable you to do that. They let you change everything, from your products to your strategies to your business model, but remain true to your essence, your basic mission and identity.</P><P>Unfortunately, over the decades, Watson’s Basic Beliefs became distorted and took on a life of their own. “Respect for the individual” became entitlement: not fair work for all, not a chance to speak out, but a guaranteed job and culture-dictated promotions. “The pursuit of excellence” became arrogance: We stopped listening to our markets, to our customers, to each other. We were so successful for so long that we could never see another point of view. And when the market shifted, we almost went out of business. We had to cut a workforce of more than 400,000 people in half. Over the course of several years, we wiped out the equivalent of a medium-sized northeastern city—say, Providence, Rhode Island.</P><DIV class=""article-callout""><DIV class=""callout-contents""><P>We were so successful for so long that we could never see another point of view. And when the market shifted, we almost went out of business.</P></DIV></DIV><P>If you lived through this, as I did, it was easy to see how the company’s values had become part of the problem. But I believe values can once again help guide us through major change and meet some of the formidable challenges we face.</P><P>For instance, I feel that a strong value system is crucial to bringing together and motivating a workforce as large and diverse as ours has become. We have nearly one-third of a million employees serving clients in 170 countries. Forty percent of those people don’t report daily to an <mark>IBM</mark> site; they work on the client’s premises, from home, or they’re mobile. And, perhaps most significant, given <mark>IBM</mark>’s tradition of hiring and training young people for a lifetime of work, half of today’s employees have been with the company for fewer than five years because of recent acquisitions and our relatively new practice of hiring seasoned professionals. In a modest hiring year, we now add 20,000 to 25,000 people.</P><P>In effect, gradually repopulating Providence, Rhode Island!</P><P>Exactly. So how do you channel this diverse and constantly changing array of talent and experience into a common purpose? How do you get people to <EM>passionately</EM> pursue that purpose?</P><P>You could employ all kinds of traditional, top-down management processes. But they wouldn’t work at <mark>IBM</mark>—or, I would argue, at an increasing number of twenty-first-century companies. You just can’t impose command-and-control mechanisms on a large, highly professional workforce. I’m not only talking about our scientists, engineers, and consultants. More than 200,000 of our employees have college degrees. The CEO can’t say to them, “Get in line and follow me.” Or “<EM>I’ve</EM> decided what <EM>your</EM> values are.” They’re too smart for that. And as you know, smarter people tend to be, well, a little more challenging; you might even say cynical.</P><P>But even if our people did accept this kind of traditional, hierarchical management system, our clients wouldn’t. As we learned at <mark>IBM</mark> over the years, a top-down system can create a smothering bureaucracy that doesn’t allow for the speed, the flexibility, the <mark>innovation</mark> that clients expect today.</P><P>So you’re saying that values are about how employees behave when management isn’t there, which it can’t be— which it shouldn’t be—given <mark>IBM</mark>’s size and the need for people to make decisions quickly. You’re basically talking about using values to manage.</P><P>Yes. A values-based management system. Let me cast the issue in a slightly different light. When you think about it, there’s no optimal way to organize <mark>IBM</mark>. We traditionally were viewed as a large, successful, “well-managed” company. That was a compliment. But in today’s fast-changing environment, it’s a problem. You can easily end up with a bureaucracy of people overanalyzing problems and slowing down the decision-making process.</P><P>Think of our organizational matrix. Remember, we operate in 170 countries. To keep it simple, let’s say we have 60 or 70 major product lines. We have more than a dozen customer segments. Well, if you mapped out the entire 3-d matrix, you’d get more than 100,000 cells—cells in which you have to close out P&amp;Ls every day, make decisions, allocate resources, make trade-offs. You’ll drive people crazy trying to centrally manage every one of those intersections.</P><P>So if there’s no way to optimize <mark>IBM</mark> through organizational structure or by management dictate, you have to empower people while ensuring that they’re making the right calls the right way. And by “right,” I’m not talking about ethics and legal compliance alone; those are table stakes. I’m talking about decisions that support and give life to <mark>IBM</mark>’s strategy and brand, decisions that shape a culture. That’s why values, for us, aren’t soft. They’re the basis of what we do, our mission as a company. They’re a touchstone for decentralized decision making. It used to be a rule of thumb that “people don’t do what you expect; they do what you inspect.” My point is that it’s just not possible to inspect everyone anymore. But you also can’t just let go of the reins and let people do what they want without guidance or context. You’ve got to create a management system that empowers people and provides a basis for decision making that is consistent with who we are at <mark>IBM</mark>.</P><P>How do the new values help further <mark>IBM</mark>’s strategy?</P><P>In two main ways. Back some 12 years ago, three-fifths of our business was in computer hardware and roughly two-fifths was in software and services. Today, those numbers are more than reversed. Well, if three-fifths of your business is manufacturing, management is basically supervisory: “You do this. You do that.” But that no longer works when your business is primarily based on knowledge. And your business model also changes dramatically.</P><P>For one thing, people—rather than products—become your brand. Just as our products have had to be consistent with the <mark>IBM</mark> brand promise, now more than ever, so do our people. One way to ensure that is to inform their behavior with a globally consistent set of values.</P><P>Second, the IT industry has continued to shift toward reintegration. We all know the story of how the industry fragmented in the 1980s and 1990s, with separate companies selling the processors, the storage devices, and the software that make up a computer system—almost killing <mark>IBM</mark>, the original vertically integrated computer company. Now customers are demanding a package of computer products and services from a single company, a company that can offer them an integrated solution to their business problems. This is a big opportunity for <mark>IBM</mark>. We probably have a wider array of computer products and services and know-how than anyone. But it’s also a challenge. How can we get our people in far-flung business units with different financial targets and incentives working together in teams that can offer at a single price a comprehensive and customized solution—one that doesn’t show the organizational seams?</P><P>Companies usually face the issue of workforce integration after a huge merger. We needed to integrate our existing workforce as a strategic response to the reintegration of the industry. It won’t surprise you that I didn’t think the answer lay in a new organizational structure or in more management oversight. What you need to foster this sort of cooperation is a common set of guidelines about how we make decisions, day in and day out. In other words, values.</P><P>And what happens when the strategy changes?</P><P>Ah, that’s why the right set of values is so important. There’s always going to be another strategy on the horizon as the market changes, as technologies come and go. So we wanted values that would foster an organization able to quickly execute a new strategy. At the same time, we wanted values that, like Watson’s Basic Beliefs, would be enduring, that would guide the company through economic cycles and geopolitical shifts, that would transcend changes in products, technologies, employees, and leaders.</P><P>How did <mark>IBM</mark> distill new values from its past traditions and current employee feedback?</P><P>The last time <mark>IBM</mark> examined its values was nearly a century ago. Watson was an entrepreneur, leading what was, in today’s lingo, a start-up. So in 1914, he simply said, “Here are our beliefs. Learn them. Live them.” That was appropriate for his day, and there’s no question it worked. But 90 years later, we couldn’t have someone in headquarters sitting up in bed in the middle of the night and saying, “Here are our new values!” We couldn’t be casual about tinkering with the DNA of a company like <mark>IBM</mark>. We had to come up with a way to get the employees to create the value system, to determine the company’s principles. Watson’s Basic Beliefs, however distorted they might have become over the years, had to be the starting point.</P><P>After getting input from <mark>IBM</mark>’s top 300 executives and conducting focus groups with more than a thousand employees—a statistically representative cross-section—we came up with three perfectly sound values. [For a detailed description of how <mark>IBM</mark> got from the Basic Beliefs to its new set of values, see the sidebar “Continuity and Change.”] But I knew we’d eventually throw out the statements to everyone in the company to debate. That’s where ValuesJam came in—this live, companywide conversation on our intranet.</P><ARTICLE-SIDEBAR class=""article-sidebar sidebar--half"" data-sidebar-alternate=""sidebar""><H4 class=""sidebar-title"">Continuity and Change </H4><DIV class=""sidebar-contents height--collapse""><P><mark>IBM</mark>’s new values grew out of a long tradition. In 1914, Thomas Watson, Sr., the founder of the modern International Business Machines Corporation, laid out three principles known as the <EM>Basic Beliefs</EM>: </P><UL><LI>Respect for the individual </LI></UL><UL><LI>The best customer service </LI></UL><UL><LI>The pursuit of excellence </LI></UL><P>Although these beliefs played a significant role in driving <mark>IBM</mark>’s success over most of the twentieth century, they eventually were subsumed—and, in effect, redefined—by a sense of entitlement and arrogance within the organization. That, according to CEO Sam Palmisano, contributed to the company’s failure to respond to market changes in the early 1990s and to its near demise. </P><P>In February 2003, just under a year after taking over as CEO, at a meeting of <mark>IBM</mark>’s top 300 managers, Palmisano raised the idea of reinventing the company’s values as a way to manage and reintegrate the sprawling and diverse enterprise. He put forth <EM>four concepts</EM>, three of them drawn from Watson’s Basic Beliefs, as possible bases for the new values: </P><UL><LI>Respect </LI></UL><UL><LI>Excellence </LI></UL><UL><LI><mark>Innovation</mark> </LI></UL><P>These were “test marketed” through surveys and focus groups with more than 1,000 <mark>IBM</mark> employees. The notion of “respect” was thrown out because of its connotations of the past. It was also decided that statements rather than just words would be more compelling. </P><P>Out of this process grew the three <EM>proposed values</EM> discussed during the July 2003 online forum, ValuesJam: </P><UL><LI>Commitment to the customer </LI></UL><UL><LI>Excellence through <mark>innovation</mark> </LI></UL><UL><LI>Integrity that earns trust </LI></UL><P>Using a specially tailored “jamalyzer” tool—based on <mark>IBM</mark>’s e-classifier software, but turbocharged with additional capabilities designed to process constantly changing content—<mark>IBM</mark> analysts crunched the million-plus words posted during the ValuesJam. Some themes emerged. For example, many people said that a silo mentality pitted the business units against one another, to the detriment of <mark>IBM</mark> as a whole. Several people characterized this as a trust issue. But the proposed value “integrity that earns trust” was criticized as being too vague. Some thought it was just another way of saying “respect for the individual,” one of the original Basic Beliefs that many now viewed as outdated. And the notion of trust was seen as being too inwardly focused—management trusting its employees—and not prescriptive enough in terms of how employees should behave with each other or with parties outside the company. </P><P>Drawing on this analysis, the results of pre- and post-jam surveys, and a full reading of the raw transcripts, a small team, with input from Palmisano, arrived at a revised set of new corporate values: </P><UL><LI><STRONG>Dedication to every client’s success</STRONG></LI></UL><UL><LI><STRONG><mark>Innovation</mark> that matters—for our company and for the world</STRONG></LI></UL><UL><LI><STRONG>Trust and personal responsibility in all relationships</STRONG></LI></UL><P>These were published on the company intranet in November 2003.</P></DIV></ARTICLE-SIDEBAR><P>What was your own experience during the jam? Did you have the feeling you’d opened Pandora’s box?</P><P>I logged in from China. I was pretty jet-lagged and couldn’t sleep, so I jumped in with postings on a lot of stuff, particularly around client issues. [For a selection of Palmisano’s postings during the ValuesJam, see the sidebar “Sam Joins the Fray.”] And yes, the electronic argument was hot and contentious and messy. But you had to get comfortable with that. Understand, we had done three or four big online jams before this, so we had some idea of how lively they can be. Even so, none of those could have prepared us for the emotions unleashed by this topic.</P><ARTICLE-SIDEBAR class=""article-sidebar sidebar--half"" data-sidebar-alternate=""sidebar""><H4 class=""sidebar-title"">Sam Joins the Fray </H4><DIV class=""sidebar-contents height--collapse""><P><mark>IBM</mark> CEO Sam Palmisano was in China on business during ValuesJam, and he logged on from there.

I hope this Jam elevates <mark>IBM</mark>s ambitions about its mission inthe 21st century..

You could say, “Oh my God, I’ve unleashed this incredible negative energy.” Or you could say, “Oh my God, I now have this incredible mandate to drive even more change in the company.”</P><DIV class=""article-callout""><DIV class=""callout-contents""><P>You could say, “Oh my God, I’ve unleashed this incredible negative energy.” Or you could say, “Oh my God, I now have this incredible mandate to drive even more change in the company.”</P></DIV></DIV><P>When Lou Gerstner came here in 1993, there was clearly a burning platform. In fact, the whole place was in flames. There was even talk of breaking up the company. And he responded brilliantly. Here’s this outsider who managed to marshal the collective urgency of tens of thousands of people like me to save this company and turn it around: without a doubt one of the greatest saves in business history. But the trick then wasn’t creating a sense of urgency—we had that. Maybe you needed to shake people out of being shell-shocked. But most <mark>IBM</mark>ers were willing to do whatever it took to save the company, not to mention their own jobs. And there was a lot of pride at stake. Lou’s task was mostly to convince people that he was making the right changes.</P><P>Once things got better, though, there was another kind of danger: that we would slip back into complacency. As our financial results improved dramatically and we began outperforming our competitors, people—already weary from nearly a decade of change—would say, “Well, why do I have to do things differently now? The leadership may be different, but the strategy is fundamentally sound. Why do I have to change?” This is, by the way, a problem that everyone running a successful company wrestles with.</P><P>So the challenge shifted. Instead of galvanizing people through fear of failure, you have to galvanize them through hope and aspiration. You lay out the opportunity to become a great company again—the greatest in the world, which is what <mark>IBM</mark> used to be. And you hope people feel the same need, the urgency you do, to get there. Well, I think <mark>IBM</mark>ers today do feel that urgency. Maybe the jam’s greatest contribution was to make that fact unambiguously clear to all of us, very visibly, in public. 
 </P><P>What were the chief points of debate—or contention?</P><P>There was actually remarkable agreement on <EM>what</EM> we all value. The debate, as it turned out, wasn’t over the values themselves so much. The debate was about whether <mark>IBM</mark> today is willing and able to live them.</P><P>For instance, people seemed to understand the need to reintegrate the company, but there were complaints—legitimate complaints—about things that are getting in the way. People would describe extremely frustrating situations. They’d say something like: “I’m in Tokyo, prototyping software for a client, and I need a software engineer based in Austin <EM>right now</EM> to help in a blade server configuration. But I can’t just say, ‘Please come to Tokyo and help.’ I need to get a charge code first so I can pay his department for his time!”</P><P>There’s a collective impatience that we’ve been tapping into to drive the change needed to make <mark>IBM</mark> everything that all of us aspire for it to be. I’m convinced that we wouldn’t have gotten to this point if we hadn’t found a way to engage the entire <mark>IBM</mark> population in a genuine, candid conversation.</P><P>By the way, having a global, universally accessible intranet like ours certainly helps, but the technology isn’t the point. I think we would’ve found a way to have this companywide dialogue if the Web didn’t exist. [For an explanation of how the jam worked, see the sidebar “Managing ValuesJam.”]</P><ARTICLE-SIDEBAR class=""article-sidebar sidebar--half"" data-sidebar-alternate=""sidebar""><H4 class=""sidebar-title"">Managing ValuesJam </H4><DIV class=""sidebar-contents height--collapse""><P><mark>IBM</mark> had experimented before with jam sessions—relatively unstructured employee discussions around broad topics—both on the corporate intranet and in face-to-face off-site brainstorming sessions. But the 72-hour ValuesJam, held in July 2003, was the most ambitious, focusing as it did on the very nature and future of <mark>IBM</mark>. </P><P>One thing was clear: You wouldn’t be able to orchestrate a forum like this, the verbal equivalent of an improvisational jam session among jazz musicians. In the words of CEO Sam Palmisano, “It just took off.” But, much like a musical jam, the dialogue was informed by a number of themes: </P><H2>Forum 1. Company Values </H2><P>Do company values exist? If so, what is involved in establishing them? Most companies today have values statements. But what would a company look and act like that truly lived its beliefs? Is it important for <mark>IBM</mark> to agree on a set of lasting values that drive everything it does? </P><H2>Forum 2. A First Draft </H2><P>What values are essential to what <mark>IBM</mark> needs to become? Consider this list: 1. Commitment to the customer. 2. Excellence through <mark>innovation</mark>. 3. Integrity that earns trust. How might these values change the way we act or the decisions we make? Is there some important aspect or nuance that is missing? </P><H2>Forum 3. A Company’s Impact </H2><P>If our company disappeared tonight, how different would the world be tomorrow? Is there something about our company that makes a unique contribution to the world? </P><H2>Forum 4. The Gold Standard </H2><P>When is <mark>IBM</mark> at its best? When have you been proudest to be an <mark>IBM</mark>er? What happened, and what was uniquely meaningful about it? And what do we need to do—or change—to be the gold standard going forward?</P></DIV></ARTICLE-SIDEBAR><P>What happened after the jam?</P><P>Well, we got a mountain of employee comments. The team analyzed all of it, and it was clear that the proposed value statements needed to change to reflect some of the nuances and emotion people expressed. So, drawing on this analysis, along with other employee feedback, a small team settled on <mark>IBM</mark>’s new corporate values.</P><P>The first value is “dedication to every client’s success.” At one level, that’s pretty straightforward: Bring together all of <mark>IBM</mark>’s capability—in the laboratory, in the field, in the back office, wherever—to help solve difficult problems clients can’t solve themselves. But this is also a lot more than the familiar claim of unstinting customer service. “Client success” isn’t just “the customer is always right.” It means maintaining a long-term relationship where what happens after the deal is more important than what happens before it’s signed. It means a persistent focus on outcomes. It means having skin in the game of your client’s success, up to and including how your contracts are structured and what triggers your getting paid.</P><P>The second is “<mark>innovation</mark> that matters—for our company and for the world.” When employees talked about <mark>IBM</mark> making a difference in the world, they included more than our work of inventing and building great products. They talked about how their work touches people and society, how we can help save lives—say, through our cutting-edge work with the Mayo Clinic or by helping governments fight terrorism with our data technology. This kind of <mark>innovation</mark> is a major reason we are able to attract great scientists. They can do cool stuff and maybe make more money in Silicon Valley—for a while, anyway—but they can do work that actually changes business and society at <mark>IBM</mark>. And it’s also about what I mentioned before: a continually experimental attitude toward <mark>IBM</mark> itself. Over most of our 90 years, with the exception of that one period when we became arrogant and complacent, this company never stopped questioning assumptions, trying out different models, testing the limits—whether in technology or business or in progressive workforce policies. Employees reminded us that those things are <mark>innovation</mark>s that matter at least as much as new products.</P><P>The third value is “trust and personal responsibility in all relationships.” There’s a lot in that statement, too. Interestingly, the feedback from employees on this value has focused on relationships among people at <mark>IBM</mark>. But we’re also talking about the company’s relationships with suppliers, with investors, with governments, with communities.</P><P>We published the values in their final form—along with some elaboration on them and some direct employee postings from the jam—in November 2003. Over the next ten days, more than 200,000 people downloaded the online document. The responses just flooded in, both in the form of postings on the intranet and in more than a thousand e-mails sent directly to me, telling us in often sharp language just where <mark>IBM</mark>’s operations fell short of, or clashed with, these ideals. Some of the comments were painful to read. But, again, they exhibited something every leader should welcome: People here aren’t complacent about the company’s future. And the comments were, by and large, extremely thoughtful.</P><P>What did you do with this feedback?</P><P>We collected and collated it. Then I printed all of it out—the stack of paper was about three feet high—and took it home to read over one weekend. On Monday morning, I walked into our executive committee meeting and threw it on the table. I said, “You guys ought to read every one of these comments, because if you think we’ve got this place plumbed correctly, think again.”</P><DIV class=""article-callout""><DIV class=""callout-contents""><P>On Monday morning, I walked into our executive committee meeting and said, “You guys ought to read every one of these comments, because if you think we’ve got this place plumbed correctly, think again.”</P></DIV></DIV><P>Don’t get me wrong. The passion in these e-mails was positive as well as negative. People would say, literally, “I’m weeping. These values describe the company I joined, the company I believe in. We can truly make this place great again. But we’ve got all these things in our way.…” The raw emotion of some of the e-mails was really something.</P><P>Now, if you’ve unleashed all this frustration and energy, if you’ve invited people to feel hope about something they really care about, you’d better be prepared to do something in response. So, in the months since we finalized the values, we’ve announced some initiatives that begin to close the gaps.</P><P>One I have dubbed our “$100 million bet on trust.” We kept hearing about situations like our colleague in Tokyo who needed help from the engineer in Austin, cases in which employees were unable to respond quickly to client needs because of financial control processes that required several levels of management approval. The money would usually be approved, but too late. So we allocated managers up to $5,000 annually they could spend, no questions asked, to respond to extraordinary situations that would help generate business or develop client relationships or to respond to an <mark>IBM</mark>er’s emergency need. We ran a pilot for a few months with our 700 client-facing teams, and they spent the money intelligently. There were lots of examples of teams winning deals and delighting clients with a small amount of “walk around money” to spend at their discretion. So, based on the success of that pilot, we expanded the program to all 22,000 <mark>IBM</mark> first-line managers.</P><P>You can do the math: $5,000 times 22,000 managers is a big number. I’m sure there were people in the company who said, “We need to get this under control.” But they’re not the CEO. Yes, you need financial controls. Yes, not every dollar spent from this Managers’ Value Fund will yield some tangible return. But I’m confident that allowing line managers to take some reasonable risks, and trusting them with those decisions, will pay off over time. The program also makes a point: that we live by our values.</P><P>The value of “trust and personal responsibility in all relationships”—including those with <mark>IBM</mark>’s shareholders— led to another initiative: a change in the way we grant top executive stock options. After getting a lot of outside experts to study this (and concluding that the complicated algorithms they recommended were wonderful, if you wanted to hire the outsiders as permanent consultants, but terrible if you wanted a simple formula that aligned executive behavior with shareholder interests), we settled on a straightforward idea. Senior executives will benefit from their options only after shareholders have realized at least 10% growth in their investments—that is, the strike price is 10% higher than the market price on the day the options are issued. Look at it this way: <mark>IBM</mark>’s market value would have to increase by $17 billion from that date before any of the execs realize a penny of benefit. We think we are the first large company to take such a radical step—and it grew out of our values.</P><P>Let me give you one more example. It may not sound like a big deal, but for us, it was radical. We overhauled the way we set prices. We heard time and again from employees about how difficult it was to put together a client-friendly, cross-<mark>IBM</mark> solution, one involving a variety of products and services at a single, all-inclusive price. We couldn’t do it. Every brand unit had its own P&amp;L, and all the people who determine prices had been organized by brand. Remember those 100,000 cells in our 3-d matrix? Our people were pulling their cross-<mark>IBM</mark> bids apart, running them through our financial-accounting system as separate bids for individual products and services. This was nuts, because it’s our ability to offer everything—hardware, software, services, and financing—that gives us a real advantage. When we bid on each of the parts separately, we go head-to-head against rivals by product: EMC in storage, say, or Accenture in services. This was tearing out the very heart of our strategy of integration, not to mention our unique kind of business-plus-technology <mark>innovation</mark>.</P><P>Let me give you a humorous (if somewhat discouraging) illustration. Every senior executive has responsibility for at least one major client—we call them “partnership accounts.” Our former CFO John Joyce, who now heads <mark>IBM</mark>’s services business, put together a deal for his account that involved some hardware, some software, and some services. He was told he couldn’t price it as an integrated solution. And he’s the CFO! So we figured out a way to set a single price for each integrated offering.</P><P>This sounds like a great business move. But what does it have to do with values? Wouldn’t you ultimately have decided you had to do that in any case?</P><P>To be honest, we’d been debating the pricing issue at the executive level for a long time. But we hadn’t done anything about it. The values initiative forced us to confront the issue, and it gave us the impetus to make the change. You know, there are always ingrained operations and habits of mind in any organization—I don’t care whether it’s a business or a university or a government. Well, the values and the jam were great inertia-busting vehicles. A small business in this place is $15 billion, and a big one is $40 billion. So you have senior vice presidents running <EM>Fortune</EM> 500–sized companies who aren’t necessarily looking for bright ideas from the CEO or some task force every day. But when you hear from so many of our people on the front lines, you can’t just ignore it. They’re crying out: “We say we value ‘client success,’ and we want to grow our business. This one thing is getting in the way of both!” You’ve got to pay attention—if not to me, then to them.</P><P>So we took the pricers—the people who set the prices for client bids—and we said to them, “You work for <mark>IBM</mark>. When there’s a cross-<mark>IBM</mark> bid with multiple products, you price it on the <mark>IBM</mark> income statement, not on the income statements of each product.” Needless to say, this involved a series of very difficult meetings with senior executives. There was a huge debate among the finance people about all the reasons why we couldn’t do it: “It will be too much work to reallocate all the costs and revenue of a project back to individual profit centers.” And they’re right: It isn’t easy, especially when we now have to certify everything. But the CFO was with me on this: After all, he’d seen the problem firsthand! And we made the change, so that now when we make a truly cross-<mark>IBM</mark> bid, we can optimize it for the client and for us.</P><P>This brings us back to the tension between soft values and hard financial metrics. In the long run, they shouldn’t conflict. But along the way, they’re going to be jabbing at each other. After all, people still have to make their numbers.</P><P>Certainly, there’s no getting around that in a commercial enterprise. But I think values inject balance in the company’s culture and management system: balance between the short-term transaction and the long-term relationship, balance between the interests of shareholders, employees, and clients. In every case, you have to make a call. Values help you make those decisions, not on an ad hoc basis, but in a way that is consistent with your culture and brand, with who you are as a company.</P><ARTICLE-PROMO class=""article-promo promo--half""><H4 class=""promo-title"">This article also appears in:</H4></ARTICLE-PROMO></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE-CONTENT></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",0.0,0.0,

Today, we have a unique opportunity to build the food system of the future and nourish the world in safe, responsible, and <mark>sustainable</mark> way.</P><P class=""p2"">To achieve this, companies like Cargill will need top talent, and that includes Hispanic and Latino professionals who bring great insights and experience. The best way to be ready for a fast-changing global food landscape is to have people who can comfortably and flexibly operate across borders, languages, and cultures.</P><P class=""p2"">At Cargill, we employ more than 1,300 food scientists who are working on the next generation of food and ingredients at our <mark>innovation</mark> centers worldwide. We have teams building the advanced data systems we’ll need to nourish a growing population. We are also empowering experts in strategy, accounting, marketing and business operations to build a globally integrated company that delivers <mark>sustainable</mark> supply chains.</P><P class=""p2"">Here’s the challenge we are working together to tackle: The planet’s population is rising and will reach 9 billion by 2050, and according to the World Wildlife Fund, we are using more resources than the Earth can supply today. That means we’ll have to grow and move significantly more food while protecting the planet in the face of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P class=""p2"">The good news is this: We know we can do it. We have access to the knowledge and technology to adapt and build the future of food. All we need now is the people to make it happen.</P><P class=""p2"">As a company that operates in seventy countries and employs 150,000 people, we know that diversity is crucial. The data is clear: diverse teams consistently deliver better results. To build new food systems, we will need all the energy and creativity a diverse workforce brings.</P><P class=""p2"">Hispanics and Latinos are a growing demographic in the United States in terms of size, education, and potential. The Census Bureau projects that Hispanics will account for 65 percent of US population growth in the next forty-five years! According to the Pew Research Center, college enrollment among Hispanics in 2014 was at 35 percent for the 18-24 age group, up from 22 percent in 1993. These numbers become even more meaningful when you take into account that nearly half of US-born Latinos are under 18.</P><P class=""p2"">That’s why we are actively reaching out. It’s why we are proud of the professional development work our Cargill Hispanic and Latino Council is doing inside and outside the company. It’s also why we have consistently argued for an effective and inclusive legal immigration policy.</P><P class=""p2"">Cargill is no stranger to Latin America. We opened our first Latin American subsidiary in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1948. Today, we have thriving businesses in thirteen countries around the region, and based on my frequent travel there, I know the region is full of possibility.</P><P class=""p2""><SPAN class=""s1"">On my last trip to Latin America, I visited three countries that offer enormous potential in food and agriculture: Brazil, Chile, and Nicaragua. In Nicaragua, I visited San Pedro Apostol School in Managua where our employees support a school nutrition program and work to advance the next generation of leaders. Our teams in Latin America are not only building high-performing businesses, but also passionate about giving back to local communities.</SPAN></P><P class=""p2"">Finally, food tastes and preferences are changing. As the Hispanic population in the US grows, Latin American food in all its rich variety is steadily gaining in popularity, not the least because more and more non-Hispanics are getting a taste for it. As a food and nutrition company, we like this trend, but we need more people to bring the Latin American menu to life in the products and ingredients we make.<SPAN class=""Apple-converted-space"">       </SPAN></P><P class=""p2"">Think about Cargill when you consider your next career decision. More than a third of our US-based employees are Hispanic, and we employ tens of thousands of native Spanish and Portuguese speakers in the rest of the world. We offer exciting career paths that few other employers can match. We have engaged many outstanding Hispanic women and men to lead our businesses.</P><P class=""p2"">Who knows, you could be the one writing this letter in the future.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE><DIV class=""related-posts""><H2>You Might Also Like</H2></DIV></MAIN></BODY></HTML>",1.0,2.0,Neutral

Expectations for the group to endorse an ambitious <mark>climate</mark> and energy action plan are high but in this guest blog for ICC, Kurt Bock, Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors and CEO of <mark>BASF</mark>, and Chairman of the Business-20 (B20) Taskforce on Energy, <mark>Climate</mark> &amp; Resource Efficiency says successful <mark>climate</mark> protection will only be possible through collective, global action.</P></SPAN><P>The Paris Agreement of December 2015 represented a breakthrough: After years of intense negotiations, 195 countries adopted the first global convention on <mark>climate</mark> protection at the United Nations <mark>Climate Change</mark> Conference. The goal is to limit the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C compared with pre-industrial levels. The agreement entered into force at the beginning of November 2016. More than two-thirds of the signatory countries have already ratified it. We are now entering the phase where all countries have to rigorously implement the necessary measures. Successful <mark>climate</mark> protection will only be possible with collective, global action.</P><P>“The G20 countries have to work together: Successful <mark>climate</mark> protection will only be possible with collective, global action.”</P><P>During its G20 Presidency, Germany can provide impetus. This group, comprising 19 countries and the European Union, accounts for around three-quarters of global <mark>CO2</mark> emissions. Furthermore, the G20 members generate around 80% of global gross national income*. Their common goal should be to boost the innovative strength of industry and accelerate the development of technologies. Only in this way will industry be able to make its maximum contribution to <mark>climate</mark> protection.</P><P>Companies such as <mark>BASF</mark> are very actively engaged in the Business 20 (B20), the forum for business representatives from the G20 states – including in the Energy, <mark>Climate</mark> and Resource Efficiency Taskforce. An important milestone in this process is the B20 Summit in early May 2017 in Berlin. What is our focus?</P><P>Even if the countries implement all of the currently agreed nationally determined contributions (NDCs), the international community will only be able to limit global warming to 3°C. Furthermore, countries that do not reach their targets will not face sanctions. Since in many countries growth, jobs and prosperity are still more important than <mark>climate</mark> protection, the global community is facing a major challenge in this respect.</P><P><STRONG>Collective, global action on <mark>climate</mark> protection</STRONG></P><P>For example, Germany – a country that accounts for barely 2% of global <mark>carbon</mark> emissions – cannot on its own contribute all that much to reducing emissions. Therefore, the G20 countries in particular have to work together. Europe currently has the world’s most ambitious goals for reducing greenhouse gases. Consequently, European industry bears a heavier burden than its international competitors. We therefore urgently need fair competitive conditions and a global approach to regulation. Otherwise, the energy and raw material costs in Germany and Europe – which are already high in worldwide comparison – will continue to rise and put the region at even more of a disadvantage. We would then have to reduce or even close production sites in Europe. Instead of exporting, we would import – likely from countries with a worse <mark>carbon</mark> footprint, since the energy and <mark>climate</mark> efficiency standards  are lower in most countries outside of Europe. This does not support <mark>climate</mark> protection.</P><P><STRONG><mark>Climate</mark> protection requires <mark>innovation</mark></STRONG></P><P>Effective global <mark>climate</mark> protection requires <mark>innovation</mark>s. And <mark>innovation</mark>s require a competitive industry which can advance the research and development of energy-efficient products and processes.</P><P>With its products, the chemical industry contributes to saving energy, avoiding emissions and therefore to achieving the greenhouse gas reduction targets. For example, the energy required to heat a single-family house built in the 1960s with an area of 160 m2 can be reduced by around 60% by insulating the exterior walls. In renewable energy generation with wind turbine systems, curing agents and resin systems are decisive for the size and lifespan of the rotor blades and thus for the economic efficiency of the plants.</P><P>Furthermore, the utilization of chemical products over their life cycles avoids many times the amount of <mark>CO2</mark> that was emitted during their production. We need the <mark>innovation</mark>s that come from industry in order to make the transition to renewable energies economically viable and to reduce energy consumption and <mark>CO2</mark> emissions in other sectors, such as construction and transportation. The important role played by industry should be recognized, especially by the G20.</P><P>In addition to the innovative contributions that chemical products are making to <mark>climate</mark> protection, the chemical industry has already made its production extremely efficient. The German chemical industry reduced its emissions by 47% between 1990 and 2014, making it a pioneer in Germany. At <mark>BASF</mark>, we have also accomplished a lot: While we have doubled our sales volumes since 1990, we have been able to cut our greenhouse gas emissions by half in absolute terms and by 75% when measured per metric ton of product. At this level, it becomes more and more challenging to develop new technological options to further avoid <mark>CO2</mark> emissions.</P><P><STRONG>Recommendations of the B20 Taskforce</STRONG></P><P>In the B20 Energy, <mark>Climate</mark> &amp; Resource Efficiency Taskforce, we address these developments and needs, and we focus our recommendations on three core topics:</P><P>First, we call for the establishment of a G20 <mark>Carbon</mark> Pricing Platform to accelerate the development of global pricing mechanisms. The aim is to create a dialogue forum to share experiences with greenhouse gas pricing mechanisms, such as emissions trading.</P><P>Second, we recommend the development of a G20 Energy <mark>Innovation</mark> Action Plan. This would enable governments to create incentives to develop and use innovative technologies, including digital solutions. This could bring about an enormous reduction in emissions.</P><P>And third, we suggest the creation of a G20 Resource Efficiency Platform. Resource efficiency is essential to succeed amid international competition and it can also lead to <mark>sustainable</mark> economic development. The information network proposed by the B20 will strengthen knowledge transfer and collaboration on technological developments and <mark>innovation</mark>s, in order to optimize resource use.</P><P><STRONG>Outlook</STRONG></P><P>And the G20 countries can do even more: At the moment, we are seeing a very volatile political environment. This makes it more difficult for industry to play its key role in <mark>climate</mark> protection and to push forward with the necessary <mark>innovation</mark>s. For companies, it is therefore even more important that the G20 recognizes the key function that industry plays in achieving the <mark>climate</mark> targets set out in the Paris Agreement. The G20 should create a regulatory framework that fosters <mark>innovation</mark> and enables fair competition between industrial companies on a global playing field. Industry will then be able to fully utilize its innovative power and shape <mark>climate</mark> protection in an environmentally friendly, socially responsible and economical way.</P><P>* World Bank (2014)</P></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,1.0,Positive

That’s when you’d quickly run after it, attempting to catch it, but you never could.

That’s when <mark>BASF</mark> stepped in and decided to be part of the solution.</P><P>“Due to a perception that habitat loss was responsible for declining populations, we felt it was important to determine how the agricultural community could develop additional habitat in non-crop areas,” said Burleson Smith, Regulatory Affairs Manager, <mark>BASF</mark>, who’s been involved in this project from the start.</P><P><mark>BASF</mark> launched a biodiversity research initiative called<A class=""externalLink"" href=""http://agro.<mark>basf</mark>.us/living-acres/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> Living Acres</A> two years ago in Holly Springs, N.C., in hope of increasing the monarchs’ population by<A class=""externalLink"" href=""https://www.usgs.gov/news/more-milkweeds-located-throughout-landscape-can-help-conserve-monarchs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> planting milkweed</A> in non-crop areas, such as ditches, roadsides, alleyways and border areas. The objective was to provide information to farmers about planting milkweed in non-crop areas in an economic and practical manner. <mark>BASF</mark> followed up this effort by spreading the word on social media this year and launching the<A class=""externalLink"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/<mark>BASF</mark>.LivingAcres/app/?sk=app_234658916574732"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> Monarch Challenge</A> on Facebook, encouraging farmers to sign up to receive a free milkweed starter kit and grow the plants to increase biodiversity. More than 1300 farm families signed up, exceeding <mark>BASF</mark>’s 500 goal for the year. <mark>BASF</mark> sent out 500 milkweed starter kits, consisting of 18 milkweed seedlings, which totaled 9,000 milkweed seedlings this year.</P><P>Aside from being a monarch larvae’s sole food, milkweed is also slightly toxic to most animals and insects, save for the monarchs, who metabolize it and incorporate it into their bodies, which protects them from danger. Research efforts have shown much better long-term success when milkweed plots were started with seedlings or root cuttings rather than seeds, according to Laura Vance, Living Acres Biology Representative, <mark>BASF</mark>.</P><P>As <mark>BASF</mark>’s initiative continues to gain more traction and corporations, such as agricultural company<A class=""externalLink"" href=""http://www.chsinc.com/our-company/news-and-media/news/2017/05/01/chs-inc-accepts-the-<mark>basf</mark>-monarch-challenge"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> CHS</A>, and universities started getting involved, the chemical company decided to go the extra mile and extend the Monarch Challenge to professional and specialty solutions businesses, such as turf grass customers. In June, the challenge included its first golf course—North Carolina State University’s Lonnie Poole. Volunteers from the college and <mark>BASF</mark>’s crop protection division in Raleigh collaborated to plant a variety of milkweed plants.</P><P>According to Moore,</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“Golf courses have ample opportunity to create quality habitat for pollinators and monarchs.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>“They cover large amounts of area and they already have the capacity to maintain their ground, so approaching them about small changes, like adding milkweed and nectar plants is not an issue.”</P><P>About 750 milkweed plants and wildflowers were planted in low-impact areas of the golf course in hopes of establishing monarch habitat.</P><P><mark>BASF</mark>’s goal with this initiative is to show how modern agriculture can coexist with refuges for monarchs and play an important role in promoting biodiversity of wildlife future generations.</P><P>“Now when I look at a garden, I see it totally different than I did before,” Vance added. “I look at which insects are on which flower, and then where are they going.

And over the past year, many countries, particularly in the developing world, decided that an especially effective way to reach those targets is through their farms.</P><P><A href=""http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5666e.pdf"">Nearly 80 percent</A> of the countries said they would use agricultural practices to curb <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/topic/<mark>climate</mark>-change"" target=""_blank""><mark>climate change</mark></A>, and more than 90 percent said they would use those practices in addition to changes in forestry and land use linked to farming.</P><P>&quot;2016 has been a very good year for agriculture and <mark>climate</mark>,&quot; said Martin Frick, director of <mark>climate</mark>, energy and tenure at the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. &quot;It's become possible to finally discuss the elephant in the room.&quot;</P><P>When <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/21112016/paris-<mark>climate</mark>-change-agreement-cop-22-marrakech-donald-trump"" target=""_blank""><mark>climate</mark> negotiators gathered in Marrakech in November</A> to begin mapping out the process for reaching the Paris goals, groups hosted at least 80 agriculture-focused sessions.</P><P>&quot;Agriculture has really lagged,&quot; said Craig Hanson, director of the food, forests and water program at the World Resources Institute. &quot;Considering it contributes 13 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and 24 percent of net emissions with land-use change, it's surprising it's taken so long...But it's finally happening,&quot; he said.</P><P><SPAN id=""docs-internal-guid-d3dc987e-65ec-6d48-ff32-58555da8fdc7"">In the U.S., the world's second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, agriculture's role in <mark>climate change</mark></SPAN> has been discussed mostly by advocacy groups. And while the Department of Agriculture has launched programs to increase farmland's capacity to capture <mark>carbon</mark>, those are voluntary. The U.S.'s plans for meeting the Paris goals rely mainly on energy and transportation.</P><P>When the U.N.'s Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark> launched its first global <mark>climate</mark> summit in 1992, agriculture hardly even entered the conversation. It wasn't until about a decade ago that research began to show its contribution to global warming, with special attention paid to the ravages of deforestation for agriculture, especially palm oil.</P><P>&quot;The numbers are pretty staggering. Maybe even a third of greenhouse gas emissions come from the land—more than transportation—but that wasn't clear until 10 years ago,&quot; said Seth Shames, who leads policy research for EcoAgriculture Partners, a group focused on hunger, rural poverty and biodiversity. &quot;Those issues started getting discussed in the <mark>climate change</mark> community. The forest people were able to get organized...and there was less political resistance in the <mark>climate</mark> world.&quot;</P><P>In response, the UNFCCC <A href=""http://redd.unfccc.int/"">launched a program</A> that pays developing countries to preserve their <mark>carbon</mark>-absorbing forests, including standards for measuring, reporting and verifying the emissions cuts.</P><P>Similar standards haven't been developed yet for agriculture.</P><P>&quot;Right now, we don't have mechanisms in place to really capitalize on the benefits that agriculture mitigation strategies can provide,&quot; said Ernie Shea, president of Solutions From The Land, a collaboration of agricultural industry and conservation groups. &quot;Forestry's much further ahead on measuring impacts. We're not there yet with agriculture.&quot;</P><P>The conversation around agriculture's role in <mark>climate change</mark> stems from a sea change in negotiations themselves. In 2009, the <mark>climate</mark> summit in Copenhagen fell apart, largely, some believe, because countries bristled at the top-down approach that dictated what countries must do.</P><P>After Copenhagen, negotiators began working instead on a pledge-based approach.</P><P>&quot;The Paris agreement doesn't impose anything on member states, and turns it around and says: What can you bring to the table?&quot; Frick explained. &quot;This fundamental change in logic has had a tremendous impact for agriculture. Agriculture, for every single country, is one of the most sensitive areas—it's an emotional topic.&quot;</P><P>Ultimately, agriculture emerged as ripe for action. It is existentially linked to a country's very survival and increasingly under threat from weather extremes, drought and floods. Agriculture, in other words, has to adapt to <mark>climate change</mark>, but also has a huge, unrealized potential to mitigate <mark>climate change</mark>. That can happen through farm practices like soil <mark>carbon</mark> sequestration through cover cropping, or by making existing farmland more productive and efficient.</P><P>&quot;Drought impacts, flooding, higher nighttime temperatures affecting pollination, new weeds, invasive species. There's an awareness in the agriculture community that we're at risk and we're not as resilient as we need to be,&quot; Shea said.</P><P>That risk is driving the discussion. Farm industry leaders and academics formed the North American <mark>Climate</mark> Smart Agriculture Alliance in 2015 to prompt changes in agricultural practices that have <mark>climate</mark> benefits. Shea says the alliance's approach, much like the approach at the international level, is to promote the idea that certain production techniques are not only better for the environment, but also for farm productivity. The alliance's members include the American Farm Bureau Federation, which continues to deny the scientific consensus on <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>&quot;People are turned off by the <mark>climate change</mark> conversation,&quot; Shea said. &quot;Once you get into a conversation about improving productivity, you can get into a conversation about co-benefits.&quot;</P><P>Greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector in developed countries average about 12 percent, compared to 35 percent in developing countries, which makes agriculture a relatively less important solution in industrialized countries. Still, advocates are pushing agricultural interests and regulators in the U.S. to do their part, pointing <A href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.13340/abstract"">to research</A> that says reaching the goals of the Paris agreement will be impossible without agriculture's contribution.</P><P>Educating farmers about the benefits—and using them to meet Paris targets—could provide the best way forward.</P><P>&quot;There's a lot of fatigue with the negativity on <mark>climate change</mark>,&quot; said Thomas Driscoll, policy director at the National Farmers Union, the U.S.'s second largest farm group. &quot;Agriculture and <mark>climate change</mark> is exciting because there's a lot that can be done. Doing the right thing for the <mark>climate</mark> can save farmers money.&quot;</P><P>But challenges lie ahead. In both developing and advanced countries, many farmers can't afford to take <mark>climate</mark>-targeted steps—such as letting land lie fallow to regenerate—unless governments provide meaningful financial incentives.</P><P>In the plans that many countries submitted to reach their <mark>climate</mark> pledges, actual details around agriculture are scarce. And only one country—Rwanda—included plans to address food waste, which <A href=""http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/"">contributes 8 percent</A> of global greenhouse gas emissions.</P><P>Homing in on those details and the precise strategies for cutting emissions is the work of the coming global talks.</P><P>&quot;The next five years is going to be period where we, as a community—researchers, agronomists, NGOs—are going to start thinking about what we can do, the bundle of things we can do in agriculture,&quot; Hanson said. &quot;We're on the agenda.

But just because it's fossil fuel consumers like power plants and drivers who ultimately burn the coal, oil and gas that emit greenhouse gases, that doesn't let the producers off the hook, she added.</P><P>&quot;A common complaint is, what about utilities, what about car-driving,&quot; Ekwurzel said. &quot;The thing is, is it the activities or is it how we've chosen to power those activities?

But is it happening?</P><P>New research by <A href=""http://www.luxresearchinc.com/"" target=""_blank"">Lux Research</A> suggests that the answer is yes. The firm predicts a $20 billion spending surge in smart technologies in the next ten years, led by electric utilities and global grid giants like <mark>ABB</mark>, who are ready to cash in on the power revolution.</P><P>The <A href=""http://www.luxresearchinc.com/images/stories/brochures/Press_Releases/RELEASE_Smart_Grid_1_26_11.pdf"">January report</A> finds that the new digital grid networks will pump out 900 percent more data to electric utility companies by 2020, as they install millions of smart meters, the in-home devices that report energy usage.</P><P>To handle the data explosion, utility companies and industrial power firms are expected to nearly triple the current $12.8 billion smart grid market to $34.2 billion by investing in the distribution hardware, management software and information technology (IT) needed.</P><P>Nearly 75 percent of that money will come from utilities updating their grids to make way for the smart grid revolution, Steve Minnihan, a Lux Research analyst and the lead author of the report, told Solve<mark>Climate</mark> News.</P><P><STRONG>Smart Grids: 'Absolutely Essential' for Clean Power</STRONG></P><P>&quot;Smart grids are absolutely essential to the widespread adoption of solar and wind energy,&quot; Minnihan said.</P><P>On a traditional electrical grid, the intermittent flows from wind farms or solar plants can sag or surge. To compensate, fossil fuel-powered energy then ticks up or down. But the movements are not adequately controlled and can lead to costly stoppages, energy leaks and overwhelming voltage levels.</P><P>The global expansion of smart grids means that renewable energy sources could increasingly hop onto a system that tracks energy flows in real-time and responds immediately to digital commands, thus taking much of the risk out of going green.</P><P>With a more efficient connection, more clean energy could reach consumers rather than get held up on an outdated grid.</P><P>Shihab Kuran, president and CEO of New Jersey-based <A href=""http://www.petrasolar.com/"">Petra Solar</A>, said: &quot;Seventy percent more solar energy could be implemented if you incorporate smart grid features. In order for solar to be successful, you really need smart grid to go there.&quot;</P><P>Speaking at a January <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/events/live/networked-solar/"">solar-smart grid conference</A> in New Jersey hosted by <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/"" target=""_blank"">Greentech Media</A>, he said that the clean technology company itself was investing in smart grids.</P><P>Since its start in 2006, Petra Solar has won around $6 million in grants from the <A href=""http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/segis.html"" target=""_blank"">Solar Energy Grid Integration System</A> (SEGIS) program by the U.S. Department of Energy to study how solar penetration affects electrical grids. The firm then went on to build its SunWave module, which features a solar panel and microinverter that attach to power poles to create a smart grid network in half an hour's time, Kuran said.</P><P>&quot;You have to think about reliability first, and solar production second,&quot; Kuran said.</P><P><STRONG>Industrial Giants, Led by <mark>ABB</mark>, Prepare for Surge</STRONG></P><P>Global manufacturing giants are already prepping themselves for the spending surge on smart grid technologies that is being spurred by utilities.</P><P>Companies like <A href=""http://www.<mark>abb</mark>.com/""><mark>ABB</mark></A>, <A href=""http://www.siemens.com/"">Siemens AG</A> and <A href=""http://www.gepower.com/"">General Electric (GE)</A>, which provide myriad services to power utility companies, are n<mark>abb</mark>ing leading telecommunications and IT firms to bolster their data-processing portfolios, hoping to secure their piece of the $34.2 billion pie.</P><P>&quot;It is a very strong move for them because it is a natural progression,&quot; Minnihan said.</P><P>He continued: &quot;The electricity industry is conservative and very slow to adopt new technologies, so if utilities have worked with a company in the past, they are more likely to adopt new smart grid technologies if they are being brought to them by a company that they already have a relationship with.&quot;</P><P>Switzerland-based <mark>ABB</mark> has led the charge. The firm provides electrical equipment at power plants and utility grids in more than 100 countries and made $32 billion in revenues in 2009.</P><P>Last May, the company spent $1 billion to acquire Atlanta-based <A href=""http://www.ventyx.com/"">Ventyx</A>, a major software, data and advisory services provider for utilities and smart grid markets. In December and January, <mark>ABB</mark> added <A href=""http://www.insertkey.com/"" target=""_blank"">Insert Key Solutions</A> (IKS) of Pennsylvania and <A href=""http://www.obvient.com/"" target=""_blank"">Obvient Strategies Inc.</A> of Georgia, both privately owned specialist software providers, to its Ventyx portfolio for undisclosed amounts.</P><P>Connecticut-based GE Energy, whose parent company made $38 billion in 2010 revenues, has gone on a spree of its own.</P><P>Last fall, it acquired large smart grid software companies <A href=""http://www.opalsoftware.com.au/"" target=""_blank"">Opal Software</A> of Australia and <A href=""http://www.snclavalin.com/ecs/en/indexen.htm"" target=""_blank"">SNC-Lavalin's Energy Control Systems</A> of Montreal for undisclosed amounts. Earlier this year, the corporation acquired Remote Energy Monitoring, a software and hardware firm in Australia and the U.K. that helps households and utilities to more efficiently manage energy usage.</P><P>German energy behemoth <A href=""http://www.siemens.com/"" target=""_blank"">Siemens</A> has similar ambitions in mind. Early last year, the company said its goal is to receive orders worth more than €6 billion, or $8.3 billion, for smart grids by 2015.

The Paris-based organization of 29 developed countries calculated the cost in 2012 and raised its estimates this year. <A href=""http://www.ceres.org/"">Ceres</A>, a Boston-based nonprofit investor group that advocates environmental sustainability, framed it as the &quot;Clean Trillion&quot; in an investment campaign that has become a rallying cry.</P><P>While $1 trillion sounds like a lot, knowing the figure is good news, according to <mark>climate</mark> activists, investment experts and United Nations organizers of the next round of global <mark>climate</mark> talks. Worldwide, almost $4 trillion a year will need to be invested over that time anyway in electric grids, power plants and energy efficiency, the IEA says. In a global economy of $75 trillion, $1 trillion works out to 1.3 percent of the world's annual output of goods and services, or about $140 a person. The calculation also focuses the discussion on investment—suggesting the potential for returns and profits—rather than on costs for disaster response and losses to rising oceans.</P><P>&quot;One of the things we're trying to show is that this is an opportunity story in response to the horror of the risks we're facing,&quot; says Sean Kidney, chief executive officer of the <A href=""http://www.<mark>climate</mark>bonds.net/""><mark>Climate</mark> Bonds Initiative</A>, a London-based nonprofit promoting large-scale investment in a low-<mark>carbon</mark> world. &quot;We're in a big hole. The key thing is for government and investors to sit down and work it out. It's got to be a grand collaboration to get out of the hole.&quot;</P><P>Putting a price tag on the energy sources, transportation systems, energy-saving steps and reductions in <mark>carbon</mark>-based greenhouse gas emissions provides a framework for discussion, according to the IEA, corporate leaders and others. It has also shifted the perspective of companies and investors. On Sept. 23, the UN is hosting a <mark>Climate</mark> Summit in New York that's meant to showcase new <mark>climate</mark>-related pledges from governments and to boost support for an international <mark>climate</mark> treaty. Next year in Paris, negotiators hope to sign a successor agreement to the expired Kyoto <mark>climate</mark> accord. </P><P><STRONG>Importance of 2 Degrees</STRONG></P><P>Nations participating in the treaty talks will attempt to work out a plan for keeping the average temperature of the world's atmosphere from climbing by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) since the dawn of the Industrial Age in the 18th Century. The rapid increase in burning of fossil fuels over the past 2½ centuries has poured billions of tons of <mark>carbon</mark> into the atmosphere, causing surface air temperatures to warm by 0.8 degrees on average, according to <mark>climate</mark> scientists. </P><P>Stopping the increase short of a 2-degree rise would allow the planet to dodge the most damaging effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, scientists say. The Earth's atmosphere is now on track to warm 4 degrees by the end of the century, triggering a range of mostly irreversible changes, leading to famine, water shortages, disease and wholesale migration away from coasts and expanding deserts, according to the <A href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/"">Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark></A>.</P><P>Nations involved in the <mark>climate</mark> treaty negotiations agreed to the goal of holding the increase under 2 degrees, but most countries probably will fall short of their goals for reduced emissions by 2020. Greenhouse gases have continued to rise, largely because of the continued expansion in burning of fossil fuels, which is responsible for 70 percent of <mark>climate</mark>-change emissions, according to the IEA. Warming is a function of the accumulation of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and other gases, so every new coal-fired power plant brings the 2-degree limit closer.</P><P>Prodded by investors and growing evidence of <mark>climate change</mark>, businesses including General Motors Co., <mark>Toyota Motor Corp.</mark>, Nike Inc., General Mills Inc., Apple Inc. and Google Inc. have taken stock of how <mark>climate change</mark> will affect them. A growing number are shifting to renewable energy, preparing for sharply higher fossil fuel costs and developing more energy-efficient products. Now business leaders are urging global leaders to act.</P><P>Leading up to the UN <mark>Climate</mark> Summit next week in New York, business groups and investors who manage trillions of dollars published reports and held meetings to call for action. Last week, investment groups publicized the creation of <A href=""http://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org/"">We Mean Business</A>, an umbrella organization of investors urging world leaders to agree on a plan for fighting <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>&quot;There's a very compelling signal to governments that business is moving forward,&quot; said Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, the group leading the <mark>climate</mark> treaty talks. &quot;The future will happen by default or design. It is in everyone's interest for that future to be based on policy on the part of governments and on design on the part of business sector. That is the ultimate collaboration that we're looking for.&quot; </P><P>While reframing the issue as an investment opportunity has altered the approach to slowing <mark>climate change</mark>, reaching a global agreement won't be easy. For years, <mark>climate</mark> talks have focused largely on the economic and environmental consequences of not acting. The goal has been to get polluting countries to agree to limits on burning of fossil fuels. With coal and oil the lifeblood of economic growth, that's been a tough sell.</P><P>Moreover, even if investment rises by more than $1 trillion a year, there's no certainty it will be enough. The <mark>climate</mark>, economies, technology and governments are complex systems that are in constant flux. This year, the IEA had to rework its estimates to reflect a larger-than-expected drop in the costs of generating solar energy, a delay in <mark>carbon</mark>-capturing technology and a hit to nuclear power projections after the Fukushima disaster in Japan.</P><P><STRONG>What $1 Trillion Will Buy</STRONG> </P><P>To make its estimate for clean energy investment, the IEA examined the costs and development of more than 500 related technologies, plumbed its 40-year database of global energy production and consumption statistics and combined them with emissions data and <mark>climate</mark> science.</P><P>In its report this year, the IEA said the world would need to invest an additional $44 trillion by 2050 in clean energy and related technologies to comply with the 2-degree pledge. The &quot;clean trillion&quot; formulation was based on the IEA's 2012 estimate of $36 trillion, but for simplicity and to account to other estimates that are higher and lower, the rounded $1 trillion has stuck. </P><P>Just to accommodate today's trends and projections for growth in energy demand, the world would have to fund $140 trillion in new and upgraded electric grids, power plants and energy efficiency, according to the IEA. The estimated $44 trillion of additional investments in clean energy increase that total by 35 percent.</P><P>While definitions vary, the IEA's clean-energy investment list includes:</P><P>• Renewable electricity-generation technologies such as wind, solar, and hydropower; </P><P>• Power infrastructure technology to eliminate wasted electricity and accommodate a mix of power sources; </P><P>• Systems that capture and store harmful <mark>carbon</mark> emissions; </P><P>• Technologies to make buildings, devices and machines more efficient; </P><P>• Improved industrial processes to reduce fuel consumption; </P><P>• Transportation advances such as hybrid/electric or fuel-cell vehicles.</P><P>Overhauling transportation will take the most money, accounting for 49 percent of the total, the IEA estimates. Power generation is second at 21 percent, with housing, offices and industrial installations accounting for the rest. </P><P>David Elzinga, author of the IEA report, warned that the $44 trillion cost estimate includes assumptions on the use of several new technologies that are still being developed, such as <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage. These need to be funded, nurtured and redesigned over time, and if successful, they will have to be widely deployed to reduce costs. </P><P>&quot;The less progress we make in the early stages, the more expensive it's going to get over the long term because you can't necessarily rush the learning,&quot; Elzinga said. &quot;You have to put the time in. You have to install the gigawatts or the megawatts in order to bring those costs down.&quot;</P><P>The world can still meet the 2-degree goal, he said, but the slower the progress, the greater the chances that existing and new fossil fuel facilities will have to be shut down before the end of their useful lives.</P><P>&quot;We see that approximately 800 gigawatts of generation capacity is going to need to be retired before the end of its technical life, so that's another example of how these costs go up,&quot; Elzinga said. &quot;Technology gets deployed, and then if we really need to meet our <mark>climate</mark> goals, we actually have to shut this stuff down. That's a waste of money.&quot;</P><P>Now, corporations, governments and groups ranging from the World Bank to pension managers are becoming more focused on the economic benefits of tackling <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>The IEA estimates, for example, that between now and 2050, the world could have a net savings of $115 trillion that would otherwise be spent on fossil fuels. The health benefits of limiting <mark>pollution</mark> also translate into substantial savings.</P><P>In addition, there is some evidence that the link between higher energy use and greater prosperity isn't absolute. <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/science/earth/sun-and-wind-alter-german-landscape-leaving-utilities-behind.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;region=CColumn&amp;module=MostEmailed&amp;version=Full&amp;src=me&amp;WT.nav=MostEmailed&amp;_r=0"">Germany</A> and some other economies have shown that economic growth and lower power use can co-exist. </P><P><STRONG>Investment Lags</STRONG> </P><P>So far, however, clean energy investment is lagging. Worldwide investment in clean energy peaked in 2011 at $318 billion, less than a third of the $1 trillion target. In 2013, clean energy funding fell to $254 billion, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The Bloomberg LP unit bases its calculations on a smaller &quot;clean energy&quot; universe than the IEA, omitting such things as energy efficiency measures, but it has consistent data stretching back to 2004.</P><P>There have been other reversals, too. Oil giants BP Plc and Chevron Corp., at one time among the largest investors in clean energy projects, have either dismantled or sold off their renewable energy units. And in some places—Australia and Ohio among them—politicians have dropped policies aimed at curbing fossil fuel use.</P><P>What's more, fossil fuel projects are still being built using outdated, more-polluting technology. According to the IEA, 60 percent of global coal technology deployed worldwide in the last 10 years fell into that category. </P><P>In January, Ceres launched an investment campaign framing the IEA's low-<mark>carbon</mark> funding target as the &quot;Clean Trillion.&quot; In a report accompanying the launch, Ceres—whose name was also the name of the Roman goddess for agriculture and fertility—laid out concrete ways to fund the transition and made the case that the task of reworking the global energy system was both feasible and potentially profitable. </P><P>&quot;A trillion is actually not a big number anymore in global economies,&quot; said Mark Fulton, a co-author of the Ceres Clean Trillion report. &quot;It's a challenge, but it's easily doable.&quot; </P><P><STRONG>Global Bond Market</STRONG></P><P>The global bond market, expected to be a critical source of clean energy money, is about $100 trillion strong—significantly larger than the market for stocks. And there is plenty of money sitting on the sidelines and transferable out of fossil-fuel investments. Pension funds, insurance companies, corporations and others have large amounts of cash on their balance sheets, and they're looking for investments that would boost returns in an era of record-low interest rates. </P><P>&quot;There is no problem with money,&quot; said Kidney of the <mark>Climate</mark> Bond Initiative, which has been following the emergence of green and <mark>climate</mark>-action bonds. &quot;The world is awash in capital that's looking for a good home.&quot; </P><P>Borrowed money in the form of bonds is especially useful for the <mark>climate</mark> challenge because ramping up renewable energy and other infrastructure requires large infusions of funds up front, and the payback accumulates over time as either revenue or savings. </P><P>A market for green bonds is already beginning to take root, with companies, governments and others selling debt instruments to fund rail projects, solar power plants, energy efficiency projects and even consumer purchases of electric cars. </P><P>Since 2008, the World Bank has issued more than $6.4 billion in green bonds in 17 currencies. The International Finance Corp. has issued $3.6 billion in green bonds. Intergovernmental economic development organizations have joined the trend, and so have governments and major corporations.</P><P>GDF Suez, a French utility, sold $3.4 billion in bonds to fund renewable projects. It was the largest green bond issued to date—and it attracted triple the amount of investment needed.</P><P>Overall, $503 billion was invested in 1,900 outstanding <mark>climate</mark>-themed bonds at the end of July, according to the <mark>Climate</mark> Bond Initiative. More than 70 percent of it funded rail and other transportation projects. A large percentage of those bonds included some form of government backing, thanks largely to the inclusion of state-backed railway projects in China and elsewhere. More green investment opportunities are needed, though, according to asset managers and investment authorities.</P><P><STRONG>'Clean-Energy Investment Gap'</STRONG> </P><P>&quot;Quite simply, there's a huge clean-energy investment gap,&quot; said Jack Ehnes, chief executive officer of the <A href=""http://www.calstrs.com/"">California State Teachers' Retirement System</A>, the second-largest U.S. pension fund, with assets of $146 billion.</P><P>Ehnes and hundreds of other leading investors attended the UN's Investor Summit on <mark>Climate</mark> Risk last January on ways to increase <mark>climate</mark>-related financing.</P><P>&quot;Meeting the $1 trillion-a-year goal will be a challenge, but it is where we need to be in order to protect and grow or portfolios and to ensure the long-term sustainability of our planet,&quot; Ehnes said. </P><P>Ceres President Mindy Lubber said pension funds aren’t alone in seeking investing opportunities. </P><P>&quot;Many in the business community ... are eager for <mark>climate</mark> action,&quot; Lubber said. &quot;Businesses have seen firsthand the devastating impact of <mark>climate change</mark>, and they realize it is not good for the planet or for our economy.&quot;</P><P>Lubber and others said there are several roadblocks slowing down clean energy investment. The main one is uncertainty over the strength of government commitments to help move energy systems from fossil fuels to clean energy. If the UN doesn't broker a <mark>climate</mark> treaty, will federal and regional governments act aggressively? Will they enact policies to accelerate the transitions—and will they renege on those policies? </P><P>&quot;Many corporations are wising up and responding to both the risks and the opportunities that <mark>climate change</mark> present,&quot; said Nigel Topping, executive director of CDP, a nonprofit that focuses on company disclosures on <mark>climate change</mark>. &quot;What's missing is a strong policy response around the world to <mark>climate change</mark>, and a lack of such a policy is adding dangerous uncertainty to the marketplace.&quot; That kind of uncertainty, he said, &quot;holds business back from bold investment.&quot;</P><P>Investors are also waiting for a strong flow of green projects that offer good returns, but that aren’t too risky. Funding won't go to green bonds in large sums unless they are financially on a par with, or better than, other investment options, investor groups say. </P><P>Governments can assist on that front, too, by providing loan guarantees and shouldering some of the costs. Last month, for example, the <A href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-infrastructure-guarantee-for-speyside-renewable-energy-plan-issued-by-treasury"">U.K. government provided guarantees</A> for $78.7 million in bonds for a Scottish biomass power project. </P><P>Such guarantees are one way governments can reduce risk and help raise investor interest in <mark>climate</mark> or green bonds. Governments can also help along the energy transformation by changing regulations, instituting mandates, providing tax breaks and incentives, and funding critical research and development, advocates say. </P><P>Policy-makers also can raise the cost of using fossil fuels by removing subsidies, creating disincentives and instituting strict emission controls.</P><P>One of the most discussed policy options is putting a price on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. One way to do that is by imposing a steadily rising tax on fossil fuel use. Another is to enact a cap-and-trade system that would set progressively lower emission limits and allow trading of emission credits in a market. Power plants and others would have to buy credits at increasing prices to continue to operate. <mark>Carbon</mark> markets are widespread in Europe and elsewhere, including in California and the Northeast. </P><P>What it comes down to, according to the UN's Figueres, is that it’s going to take major commitments from government leaders and investors to help the world stay clear of the worst effects of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>&quot;This is absolutely critical, because we are running out of time,&quot; she said. &quot;We can no longer afford the luxury of being gradual or incremental. We really do need very, very stark changes right away.&quot;</P><P><EM>An earlier version of this story misstated that the $1 trillion per year clean energy investment was equivalent to $10,400 per person.</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,0.0,

During that time, <mark>BMW</mark> asked owners of its electric cars if they would be willing to delay recharging them by an hour on the company's cue.</P><P>An app notified the owners when a delay was coming, and they could opt out if they needed to charge at that time.</P><P>&quot;Eighteen months later, I can unequivocally state that participation was transparent, hassle-free and mind-numbingly dull to the point that I mostly forgot about it,&quot; one participant, John Higham, wrote in a <A href=""http://insideevs.com/18-month-real-world-trial-proves-electric-vehicles-can-stabilize-the-grid/"">first person account</A> of his experience for Inside EVs.</P><P>The trial led <mark>BMW</mark> and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E), the utility for Northern California, to suggest that if electric vehicles become as popular as expected, electric vehicle demand management could become a powerful tool for supporting grid flexibility.</P><P>&quot;The overall lesson is we can use resources likes electric vehicles to help support the grid during times of peak use,&quot; said Ari Vanrenen, a spokesman for PG&amp;E.</P><P>Renewable energy experts have long held the theory that electric vehicles will play a momentous role in helping the electric grid be more flexible. EVs could be deployed to buffer uneven power generation of wind and solar. Owners might, for example, wait to charge their cars until the height of the day, when solar is most plentiful and cheapest. Or, they might delay their charging during peak hours in the early evening, when the grid is under the most stress.</P><P>As of now, customer sensitivity to prices is still an unknown quantity. While the <A href=""http://www.pgecurrents.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/PGE-<mark>BMW</mark>-iChargeForward-Final-Report.pdf""><mark>BMW</mark>-PG&amp;E partnership</A> tested only whether customers would agree to delay their demand by an hour if given a financial incentive, it offered some concrete evidence that influencing customer behavior is possible.</P><H3>How <mark>BMW</mark> Managed Demand</H3><P>For the test, PG&amp;E asked <mark>BMW</mark> to build a system that could remove 100 kilowatts of demand from the grid on short notice.</P><P>PG&amp;E could make the call at a random time. Of particular interest to the utility was whether demand could eventually be decreased during <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/14062017/solar-renewable-energy-negative-prices-california-power-grid-solutions"">peak load hours</A> of 4 p.m. to 7 p.m., when solar power is waning for the day and demand on the grid ramps up.</P><P><mark>BMW</mark>'s app would signal to customers that a one-hour delay was coming. If the car was connected to a charging station at that time, <mark>BMW</mark> could trigger the charging delay through software in the vehicle. Participants were paid $1,000 up front to participate in the study and $540 more depending on how many times their vehicle participated in the request for a one-hour delay.</P><P>If <mark>BMW</mark> could not meet the power reduction goal through delaying customer charging, it was encouraged to supply the necessary charging through its own battery storage center.</P><P>Throughout the 18-month test period, which ended in December 2016, customers were asked to delay 209 times. <mark>BMW</mark> was able to meet its obligations to reduce power about 90 percent of the time, however only 20 percent came from owner demand reduction and 80 percent come from <mark>BMW</mark>'s battery storage.   </P><H3>The Challenge of Charging Times</H3><P>While that seems far from conclusive, the results have to be seen in the context of a small pool of drivers whose vehicles would have to be connected to a charging station when the request came in. <mark>BMW</mark> found an average of only about seven of the nearly 100 cars involved were typically available to participate when a reduction request was announced. A lack of EV charging at work lowered the numbers.</P><P>If the time of the request came between 11 p.m. and 2 a.m., when cars were more likely to be plugged into their home charging stations, vehicle owners were much more likely to participate in the delay.</P><P>Since 93 percent of the participants stated that they liked the program and would be willing to participate in a similar program going forward, PG&amp;E said it was eager to conduct a larger second phase. The California Energy Commission has given <mark>BMW</mark> a grant to lead that second phase with support from PG&amp;E that has already begun.</P><P>As more and more EVs hit the road, programs like this have broad promise, the companies said.</P><P>&quot;We can extrapolate to the future likely load reduction from plug-in vehicle drivers, as EV adoption increases,&quot; said Rebecca Kiehne, a spokesman for <mark>BMW</mark> North America. &quot;If we assume 20 percent of all existing EV owners enroll in a similar program, and behave similarly, a single future event might result in a load drop big enough to power approximately 58,000 homes in California.&quot;</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""tagged-with""><LABEL>Published Under:</LABEL></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>",0.0,2.0,Neutral

In a California courtroom on Wednesday, <mark>Chevron</mark>’s attorneys didn’t dispute the science that suggested humans, and by extension oil companies, were at least contributing to adverse <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P><mark>Chevron</mark> stock holders need not hit the panic button just yet. <mark>Chevron</mark> didn’t exactly admit guilt as it pertains to its role in <mark>climate change</mark>. And, the legal argument being levied against “Big Oil” in this particular case is a bit confusing in its goal. Every little bit helps, or hurts, though, depending on which side of the table you’re sitting on.</P><H3>It’s Complicated</H3><P>The pre-trial hearing, which took place in San Francisco, didn’t determine innocence or guilt. The hearing was simply an unconventional way for litigants to decide which weapons would be allowed to be wielded in an upcoming legal battle between the five most prominent oil names and the coastal cities of San Francisco and Oakland.</P><P>They’re suing the five Big Oil icons not to stop spewing <mark>CO2</mark> into the earth’s atmosphere, but rather, to demand these energy companies <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-<mark>climate</mark>change-hearing/<mark>chevron</mark>-says-it-will-not-dispute-<mark>climate</mark>-science-in-u-s-lawsuit-idUSKBN1GX185"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">help fund the construction of a wall</A> that will keep rising ocean waters from creeping into their cities.</P><P><mark>Chevron</mark>’s lawyers, along with attorneys representing the other top four oil names, are asking for a dismissal of the pending case. In the meantime though, none of them are denying that the plaintiff’s evidence of global warming is untrue.</P><P>The defendants are, however, still going to argue they can’t be held liable for the outcome of higher global temperatures. They all agree that only Congress (via the EPA) has jurisdiction over the fossil fuel emissions.	</P><P>The defendants added for good measure that they only provided what was being used by consumers, and that unchecked population growth exacerbated the issue.</P><H3>The Case for <mark>Chevron</mark> Stock</H3><P>It’s not a bad legal argument, truth be told. As <mark>Chevron</mark>’s written request for a dismissal <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/<mark>chevron</mark>-will-stick-to-ipcc-findings-in-landmark-<mark>climate</mark>-change-trial/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">noted</A>:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“This is not the first (or even the second or third) time a plaintiff has tried to plead global warming-related tort claims. Similar claims have been considered, and dismissed, by the Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit, and district courts around the country.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Also weakening the plaintiff’s case is the nature of the suit itself.</P><P>It’s being filed as a nuisance suit, which generally call for the closure of a business or the removal of an annoying eyesore or noise. Not this nuisance suit though. This one is gunning for money. Richard Faulk, public-nuisance experts and counsel with Davis Wright Tremaine, commented on the matter “what we have here is a typical tort lawsuit for damages.”</P><P>The plaintiff’s attorneys aren’t exactly shooting blanks though. Along with Big Oil’s concession that <mark>climate change</mark> is real, even if their role in it has not yet been determined, the suit also claims that the likes of Exxon Mobil, BP and <mark>Chevron</mark> all funded <mark>climate change</mark> research that was ultimately intended to mislead the public about fossil fuel’s role in damage to the environment.</P><P>As San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said it, “These companies knew their products were causing sea-level rise, and they deceived people about it. Now, that bill has come due.”</P><H3>Bottom Line for <mark>Chevron</mark> Stock</H3><P>From a pure letter of the law perspective, owners of <mark>Chevron</mark> stock don’t have a great deal to worry about. At worst it would share a modest amount of liability with the rest of the oil industry, as sole causation has yet to be pegged to oil companies. And, even if it is determined, this really is an EPA matter.</P><P>The deception claims (suggesting that Big Oil paid to deceive… everyone) haven’t worked in other similar cases.</P><P>On the flipside, U.S. courtrooms are increasingly moving away from ruling based on the strictest letter of the law, and <A href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2010/08/in_defense_of_the_new_judicial_activists.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">instead making decisions grounded in a sense of fairness</A>. On the wrong day at the wrong time with a judge and jury in the wrong mood, this could end up being a blow to Big Oil.</P><P>The real risk to <mark>Chevron</mark> stock, however, goes beyond this one case. By forcing oil companies to take the small step of acknowledging that <mark>climate change</mark> science is valid now, the next step to energy companies conceding fossil fuels are a leading cause of <mark>climate change</mark> is a small one.</P><P>The <mark>climate</mark> activists’ war won’t be won with a decisive victory, but dozens and dozens of successful, progressive skirmishes.</P><P><EM>As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

BP has been looking for a buyer for the Forties pipeline system for more than a year. Finding a committed long-term investor in the infrastructure was crucial to the wider health of the North Sea industry because of its integral position in the web of interconnecting pipelines that take oil ashore.

In part 1, Prof. Dr. Mohrdieck discusses the F-CELL vehicle itself, the engineering challenges involved in its development and the territories currently leading the way in hydrogen infrastructure.</EM></P><H4 name=""6d8a"" id=""6d8a"" class=""graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"">Firstly, can you tell us about the technical specifications of the Mercedes-Benz GLC F-CELL?</H4><FIGURE name=""363f"" id=""363f"" class=""graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--h4""><FIGCAPTION class=""imageCaption""><EM class=""markup--em markup--figure-em"">Prof. Dr. Christian Mohrdieck, Daimler’s Fuel Cell Director.</EM></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P name=""867d"" id=""867d"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--figure"">The F-CELL’s engine has a power output of 150kW (204 horsepower), which is a significant power level for this type of car. It also offers an impressive driving range. This depends on driver behavior and we are waiting for confirmation of the numbers, but we expect the F-CELL to achieve a range of around 500km, based on the New European Driving Cycle.</P><BLOCKQUOTE name=""297b"" id=""297b"" class=""graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"">“The power level and acceleration are the same as you’d expect from any Mercedes-Benz car, whether internal combustion engine (ICE) or hybrid.”</BLOCKQUOTE><H4 name=""b8cb"" id=""b8cb"" class=""graf graf--h4 graf-after--pullquote""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--h4-strong"">What distinguishes the F-CELL from other hydrogen vehicles?</STRONG></H4><P name=""f05b"" id=""f05b"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--h4"">There are two main distinctions, the first of which concerns performance. The power level and acceleration are the same as you’d expect from any Mercedes-Benz car, whether internal combustion engine (ICE) or hybrid. It also offers the same high level of safety, quality and comfort.</P><P name=""13a3"" id=""13a3"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">The second distinction is that this car is a plug-in fuel cell hybrid, which is a first for a series production vehicle. This combination of fuel cell and plug-in battery is ideal given the progressive development of the hydrogen infrastructure. The car’s lithium battery has an energy capacity of about 9 kWh, giving the car an additional range of about 50km. It has an onboard charger so it can be charged at any socket or charging station.</P><H4 name=""183c"" id=""183c"" class=""graf graf--h4 graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--h4-strong"">What are the main differences between the F-CELL and a conventional car?</STRONG></H4><P name=""b640"" id=""b640"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--h4"">Firstly, it’s a zero emissions car — no emissions at all, just water vapor coming out of the tailpipe. Secondly, the car has tremendous acceleration. This is due to the electric drivetrain that provides instantaneous torque, even at zero rpm (rotation per minute). The third feature that is very noticeable is that the car is extremely quiet, in terms of both audible noise and also vibration. It’s a smooth and very comfortable driving experience.</P><BLOCKQUOTE name=""5e4e"" id=""5e4e"" class=""graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"">“We reduced the amount of platinum by 90%, which provides a significant cost reduction.

This meant designing the fuel cell to very specific geometrical dimensions. An additional requirement was crash worthiness, which is not only about shape and dimensions but also the positioning of soft and rigid parts in order to achieve the desired crash behavior. As a result, we can say that this car fulfills the same very high crash standards as any other Mercedes-Benz car.</P></DIV><DIV class=""section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn""><FIGURE name=""0f45"" id=""0f45"" class=""graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p""><FIGCAPTION class=""imageCaption"">Mercedes-Benz GLC-F-CELL, drive system, © Daimler AG</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><DIV class=""section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn""><P name=""2f37"" id=""2f37"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--figure"">The other issue on packaging was where to situate the sizeable hydrogen cylinders. We found two very good locations. Rear wheel drive ICE cars have a driveshaft tunnel to drive the rear wheels, which isn’t necessary with an electric motor because it is mounted directly to the axle. So we put a hydrogen container into this space. Along with a second container underneath the rear seats. This enables the car to hold more than 4kg of hydrogen, which leads to the driving range that I mentioned earlier.</P><BLOCKQUOTE name=""1398"" id=""1398"" class=""graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"">“A fuel cell can be refueled very quickly, in three minutes, and has a long range of around 500km or 600km.

For example, we reduced the amount of platinum by 90%, which provides a significant cost reduction. Our fuel cell is not much above the platinum loading of a catalytic converter on a conventional car.</P><FIGURE name=""e448"" id=""e448"" class=""graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p""><FIGCAPTION class=""imageCaption"">The Mercedes-Benz fuel cell system, © Daimler AG</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H4 name=""31da"" id=""31da"" class=""graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--h4-strong"">Was it very difficult to achieve the reduction in fuel cell size?</STRONG></H4><P name=""9ef6"" id=""9ef6"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--h4"">Yes, there were significant challenges. We needed to design a sufficient active area into a very restrictive packaging space. This was an issue on the level of electrochemical activity, and also on the mechanical engineering side. We had to find a way to package such a cell into an integrated frame that also satisfied the crash requirements. The successful achievement of this objective depended on a very close collaboration between our vehicle colleagues and fuel cell powertrain engineers.</P><H4 name=""111e"" id=""111e"" class=""graf graf--h4 graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--h4-strong"">Who do you think will be buying this car?</STRONG></H4><P name=""2c04"" id=""2c04"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--h4"">We aim to sell our car in all areas where there is sufficient hydrogen infrastructure. The prerequisite is the presence of refueling stations within acceptable reach.</P><P name=""b9b2"" id=""b9b2"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Three areas come to mind as having sufficient infrastructure at this point in time. One is Germany, our home market, where we’ve set up a joint venture, H2 Mobility, to build up and implement the hydrogen infrastructure, which is supported by the German federal government. And then there’s California, which has always been very active in this area. The state aims to have 500 hydrogen stations installed by 2022, which again involves a joint effort between car manufacturers, energy companies and the state government. The third region, where we already have more than 80 hydrogen stations, is Japan.</P><P name=""8012"" id=""8012"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">There are also many other countries where the hydrogen infrastructure is expanding rapidly, for example in the UK, France and some Scandinavian countries, but it takes time to build a network that provides the required coverage.</P><H4 name=""0c78"" id=""0c78"" class=""graf graf--h4 graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--h4-strong"">Why are Germany, California and Japan so advanced in terms of hydrogen infrastructure?</STRONG></H4><P name=""956a"" id=""956a"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--h4"">California has been very active in alternative drivetrains for many decades. It has very strict regulations regarding tailpipe emissions. For example, the state has implemented the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate, which requires large volume car manufacturers to sell a minimum number of zero emission vehicles. And there are only two options: battery electric and fuel cell vehicles. Both have specific application areas. A fuel cell can be refueled very quickly, in three minutes, and has a long range of around 500km or 600km. And there’s also the possibility to apply a fuel cell to a broad range of vehicles including buses, trucks and delivery vans. For these reasons California has been working for more than two decades to support this technology.</P><P name=""c323"" id=""c323"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Similarly, in Japan, there is a close collaboration between government and car companies to support the development of hydrogen infrastructure. Japan also has one of the most dense electric charging infrastructure networks. The country has adopted a very systematic approach: it now has sufficient charging stations, so it is gradually switching government support from charging to hydrogen, because this will be the next generation technology.</P><P name=""9225"" id=""9225"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">In Germany we have the Clean Energy Partnership, which aims to tackle <mark>climate change</mark> by supporting the development of emission-free mobility. This is a joint initiative, established in 2002, involving car companies, infrastructure companies and government authorities. In the first phase, Linde and Daimler aimed to build 20 stations, and then six companies got together in a joint venture — Shell, OMV, Air Liquide, Linde, Total and Daimler — with the goal of building 400 stations by 2023.</P><P name=""5c1a"" id=""5c1a"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"">Other car companies such as Toyota, Honda and BMW have joined this initiative as associated partners, creating a very broad basis for this activity. This is essential because it will take some time to build up the hydrogen network, and for the first few years this infrastructure network will not lead directly to any earnings.</P></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION name=""ca71"" class=""section section--body section--last""><DIV class=""section-content""><DIV class=""section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn""><P name=""e61b"" id=""e61b"" class=""graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing""><EM class=""markup--em markup--p-em"">This is the first part of two.

Before joining <mark>ABB</mark> in 2010, Markus earned an Engineering degree with a focus on Energy Technology, worked for the Japanese multinational conglomerate company Hitachi, and held several international management positions in marketing, sales and business development.

Today, we are the world leader in microgrids technology. Our main goal is to integrate more renewables into grids across the globe, thus being a main actor in driving the energy transition forward. We are continually working on lowering the <mark>carbon</mark> intensity across all our services and all our current implementations of the microgrid technology save fossil fuels every day.</P><P name=""bffc"" id=""bffc"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">Why are microgrids of crucial importance?</STRONG></P><P name=""1785"" id=""1785"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">We’re currently witnessing a global trend in full swing, which is the rapid growth of renewables. This trend is driven by price reductions and the more decentralised nature of renewables. In both mature and emerging markets, renewables have taken leadership for the investment in power generation. The microgrid technology is the natural development to keep this trend growing, and to integrate more renewables into our power supply on and off grid. Renewables also have a different interaction with the grid and the consumer; this interaction needs to be managed as intelligently as possible, which modern microgrids do while improving system reliability.</P><P name=""1afc"" id=""1afc"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">What are the main advantages of microgrids?</STRONG></P><P name=""ca76"" id=""ca76"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Microgrids are like smaller versions of the national electricity grid running independently. They are a complement to the centralised transmission grid system, which has quite a lot of drawbacks (energy loss, high investment cost, disturbances for users, etc.). The microgrid technology address all these issues, especially for communities and regions that have adequate renewable energy resources.</P><P name=""63ba"" id=""63ba"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Microgrids also have much smaller financial commitments, they use renewable energy resources, hence are more environmentally friendly with lower <mark>carbon</mark> footprints; they are also isolated from any grid disturbance or outage and require fewer technical skills (as large scale power plants) to operate as they rely more on automation.</P><P name=""30f2"" id=""30f2"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Microgrids thus enhance the grid resilience and stability and contribute to the energy security by controlling its distributed energy resources. Operating in either grid-connected or islanded mode, microgrids have the ability to integrate and dispatch these resources, which include renewable generation, fossil fuel generation and storage, and finally manage loads.</P></DIV><DIV class=""section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn""><P name=""fc55"" id=""fc55"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--figure""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">On the other side, what would you say are the biggest challenges facing the uptake of microgrids worldwide?</STRONG></P><P name=""1b5d"" id=""1b5d"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">What’s not a problem is the technology. Indeed, it has been here for many years, and has now reached a mature status. Our main challenge today is to convince customers and stakeholders to accept new roles and responsibilities. In every area of business, it is always a challenge to adapt traditional commercial and technical concepts, but this is also what makes this work interesting. We’re pioneers.</P><P name=""3df1"" id=""3df1"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">With the integration of microgrids, existing players that have always had central power lose some of that control. There is a shift in responsibilities. A large energy customer can, for instance, implement his own microgrid and produce a lot of his energy, instead of buying it from his utility. But what happens when this customer doesn’t want to maintain his microgrid? Could the utility provider make new revenue by maintaining the microgrid, and providing high-quality grid stability? These questions are still unanswered, although we are already seeing the emergence of multiple business models, which is exciting.</P><P name=""1017"" id=""1017"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">As for any new technology, we must create trust in the concept. As described, microgrids go along with a shift in responsibilities and loss of centralised control. Not all influential stakeholders in the electricity system are happy with that shift. And regulators responsible for system stability need to be further convinced that decentralised power generation will guarantee and even improve grid stability. Let’s not forget that with any change, always comes resistance.</P><P name=""19bf"" id=""19bf"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">How are microgrid revolutionizing the energy structure in emerging countries?</STRONG></P><P name=""35ff"" id=""35ff"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">In an emerging market with growing population and electricity demand, microgrids provide reliable power supply, starting from small energy systems and finally supporting the bulk of the electric system. The implementation time of microgrids is much faster and cheaper than fossil fuel based power plants and large infrastructure. To give you a rough idea, it takes around six months to get a microgrid generating electricity online and a realistic timeframe for coal plants is between 5 to 10 years.</P><P name=""d88b"" id=""d88b"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Microgrids are best known for delivering electricity to communities or industrial operations in remote or inaccessible areas where it is too costly or difficult to provide a grid connection. However, grid-connected microgrids are now taking on a new role in developed areas of the world to ensure continuity of supply in the event of potential grid faults and emergencies. The ability of microgrids to seamlessly separate and isolate themselves from the main grid when needed is an increasingly important feature.</P><P name=""18fe"" id=""18fe"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">As a disruptive invention, have you ever faced any resistance from mainstream grid suppliers and governments when it comes to introducing microgrids to markets across the globe?</STRONG></P><P name=""63dc"" id=""63dc"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">We had in the past, but it is becoming better. Years ago, grid suppliers and utilities were hesitant because the magnitude of implementation of renewables and batteries were not so clear. Today, distribution system operators are a lot more open to the concept of microgrids. They are responsible for providing grid stability, and they face a lot of integration of renewable energy — starting from house — holds up to utility scale projects — so they are familiar with the realities of a changing grid.</P><P name=""d283"" id=""d283"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">In fact, whoever is responsible for the system stability has now started to see distributed generation and microgrids as a reliable option.</P><P name=""9c59"" id=""9c59"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">Tell us about <mark>ABB</mark> successes in transforming the energy systems abroad?</STRONG></P><P name=""b2c0"" id=""b2c0"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">We have over 40 references globally with a wide spread of applications, from industry applications to powering harbours. Let me give you a few examples. As far as industrial applications are concerned, we have delivered a microgrid to support a factory in South Africa with handling of critical loads that also stabilises the grid connection, integrating renewable energy and batteries. This has reduced the downtime of the factory as well as the usage of diesel generation, resulting in a lot of savings for the customer. We are currently commissioning a similar project for the Red Cross to support their logistic centre in Tanzania.</P><P name=""1335"" id=""1335"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Another recent project we have done was to build several microgrid solutions that ensure high penetration of photovoltaics into the energy systems of mines in very off-grid locations. Those microgrids ensure grid stability and cost reduction from less usage fossil fuels.</P><P name=""b314"" id=""b314"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">In Aruba and Kodiak Island (Alaska), we have delivered solutions to increase the penetration of renewables and reduce the high cost of diesel for the local community. These projects were good examples of the application of microgrids powering remote communities.</P><P name=""50e7"" id=""50e7"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Amongst the other projects we are proud of is the implementation of microgrids on an oil and gas platform. This project will specifically be designed to provide a so-called spinning reserve and replace existing gas turbines.</P><P name=""24e2"" id=""24e2"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">All of those implemented microgrids drastically lower the usage of fossil fuels. It’s diffcult to give an exact number, as every implementation is different, but when you switch from an often diesel-powered scenario to a microgrid scenario with a diesel supplying just 15% of the energy during the year — you need a lot less fossil fuels.</P></DIV><DIV class=""section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn""><P name=""9f03"" id=""9f03"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--figure""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">In regard to these off-grid mining projects, can you tell us how renewable and storage technologies present an opportunity to improve the mine’s environmental footprint?</STRONG></P><P name=""0f69"" id=""0f69"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Mines in off-grid areas generate most of their power with diesel generators. Although the cost of diesel went down, the transportation costs to get the fuel to an off-grid location have remained the same. More and more mining companies are also looking into <mark>sustainable</mark> solutions to improve their environmental footprint.</P><P name=""301c"" id=""301c"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Mines are mainly located in areas with either good wind or photovoltaics conditions and often have little restrictions in regards of available space. With the drop in CAPEX of renewables, the cost of electricity produced by wind or photovoltaics can be significantly cheaper than any other energy source.</P><P name=""3b0d"" id=""3b0d"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">In order to use those renewable resources, <mark>ABB</mark>’s microgrid solutions (<mark>ABB</mark> PowerStoreTM) can enable a mine to often use as much as 100% renewable energy while ensuring grid stability and power quality.</P><P name=""33ce"" id=""33ce"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">According to your experience, what single change — technological, regulatory or otherwise — could further catalyse the industry?</STRONG></P><P name=""0391"" id=""0391"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">There are three very obvious catalysts. First of all, more regulatory certainty would increase the speed of growth, as more certainty usually improves the availability of financing. That’s a simple observation, but we can observe this in many projects. Any serious implementation of <mark>carbon</mark> pricing would also greatly benefit the integration of renewables and thus microgrids, that’s the second idea. Last but not least, battery prices are decreasing — any additional decrease multiplies that attractiveness of microgrids in many areas.</P><P name=""ca2f"" id=""ca2f"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">Talking about the future, where globally do you think will see the biggest expansion of microgrids in five years from now?</STRONG></P><P name=""aba4"" id=""aba4"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">We look at this less in geographies, and more in applications that geographies can have in common. The largest growth will happen in remote communities, whether this is a town in Alaska or a village in Africa. This should be followed by established utilities pushing into microgrids to lower costs and retain customer access. Another very promising parametre we expect is the growth coming from commercial and industrial applications.</P><P name=""87cd"" id=""87cd"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">How optimistic are you about “plug and play” microgrid systems like the PowerStoreTM supporting the replacement of most of the fossil fuel-based capacity in off-grid locations like mining or island utilities in the future?</STRONG></P><P name=""402e"" id=""402e"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">We are very optimistic about it. <mark>ABB</mark> has standardised and productised PowerStoreTM solutions to enable “plug and play” integration. These solutions are pre-designed and they are transportable on trucks to any place in the world. The intelligent control of the PowerStoreTM is also predefined for various application and works for both grid connected and off-grid systems.</P><P name=""75bd"" id=""75bd"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--figure""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">What are the main benefits of the different models of the PowerStoreTM system (Standalone, Hybrid, Station, Integrated)?</STRONG></P><P name=""98df"" id=""98df"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">We have standardised different products for different applications so our range of products fulfil the market requirements that we have studied for many years. The Standalone is specifically built for larger sites like mining and in case battery manufacturers take a more visible role in the projects; the Hybrid system is most useful for the very small application in remote villages; and the Station and Integrated usually fit better for commercial and industrial applications.</P><P name=""7452"" id=""7452"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">What is your vision for the future of off-grid electricity?</STRONG></P><P name=""9609"" id=""9609"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">I hope that off-grid areas in emerging countries will leapfrog several steps in the <mark>sustainable</mark> development and directly embrace a multi-energy infrastructure and distributed generation.

The transfers were made through the Luxembourg branch of UBS bank.According to bank data gathered through international cooperation with Luxembourg, Ocean Connect Marine was the biggest contributor to the offshore account.In a plea bargain, former <mark>Petrobras</mark> official Paulo Roberto Costa told Brazilian federal prosecutors that <mark>Petrobras</mark> hired a Glencore trading company, and that he received bribery payments.A document in the possession of federal prosecutors shows a payment of $9,973.29 to Paulo Roberto Costa in relation with &quot;Trading Glencore.&quot;In their initial filing, federal prosecutors said &quot;the payment to Paulo Roberto Costa is an evidence that the payment of illegal advantages to <mark>Petrobras</mark> officials was a common procedure also in the Glencore contracts intermediated by Konstantinos Kotronakis and Georgio Kotronakis.&quot; *In his decision to accept the case, Judge Sergio Moro said &quot;It is likely, therefore, that the entire amount, or at least part of the bank deposits from Ocean Connect Marine, wholly owned by Glencore, to Seaview Shipbroking Ltd. has been used for the payment of illegal advantage to officials.&quot;The case was disclosed today by the Brazilian Federal Prosecutors' Office in the state of Paraná, which is spearheading most of the investigation into <mark>Petrobras</mark> corruption known as Lava Jato.Federal prosecutors requested the temporary arrest of a number of individuals who allegedly took part in two corruption schemes related to <mark>Petrobras</mark>. No steps against the corporations have yet been taken.One case relates to charter contracts with Greek shipping groups Tsakos and Aegean and with companies Dynacom Tankers Management, Galbraiths and Dorian Hellas, which signed contracts worth over $500 million with <mark>Petrobras</mark>.The second case involves asphalt supply from American company Sargeant Marine to the oil giant in contracts worth about $180 million. Politicians and officials are also being targeted by this probe.Glencore declined to comment on the investigation. In a statement sent to MLex, it said, &quot;Glencore is committed to uphold good business practices, to apply Glencore's standards and policies to our activities and to meet or exceed applicable laws and external requirements.&quot;</P><P><EM>*MLex translation of a Portuguese document.</EM></P><SECTION class=""share-links""><DIV class=""title"">Share this </DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1.0,1.0,

By <U><A href=""https://mlexmarketinsight.com/expertise/contributors/matthew-newman"">Matthew Newman</A></U>.</H4><P>The EU hasn't been shy in unleashing its tough antitrust laws against even the most powerful and well connected of companies — including Russia's natural gas giant <mark>Gazprom</mark>. But when it comes to government-to-government agreements, the EU watchdog says its hands are tied.</P><P>That's the message coming from today's two-pronged announcement from Margrethe Vestager. The EU's antitrust chief reminded journalists that while she has been able to demand and obtain concessions from <mark>Gazprom</mark> on its supply of natural gas, she just doesn't have the power to deal with certain government deals.</P><P>Today, Vestager was obliged to admit that Russia's agreement with Poland had led her to drop objections to <mark>Gazprom</mark>'s control over a crucial pipeline crossing the country. &quot;As regards the Yamal pipeline, the situation cannot be changed by antitrust procedure,&quot; she conceded.</P><P>Yet when it comes to the state-backed <mark>Gazprom</mark>, there is a fine line between state and non-state actors — and the European Commission knows this well.</P><P>Since the EU regulator began its investigation of <mark>Gazprom</mark> in 2012, company officials have argued that the bloc has no jurisdiction to apply European antitrust law because the gas giant is under the Russian government's control.</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> argued that its conduct in Eastern Europe is governed by agreements between Russia and various Eastern European governments. As a result, <mark>Gazprom</mark> has been acting under the direct responsibility of Russia. Under EU rules, antitrust rules don't apply to governments.</P><P>The commission has steadfastly rejected these arguments — and the regulator's seven-week &quot;market test&quot; asking rivals and customers to respond to <mark>Gazprom</mark>'s commitments to change contracts and free gas flows suggests it is having some success.</P><P>But when it comes to gas deals underpinned by solid, state-to-state arrangements, Vestager has had to throw in the towel. And in the case of the Yamal pipeline, that's a galling realization, given that the Danish antitrust chief has real concerns.</P><H4>Market test</H4><P>The commission's market test, announced today, follows <mark>Gazprom</mark>'s offer to change contracts to allow customers to sell Russian gas crossing their borders to a third countries. For example, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia may want to sell their Russian gas to a Baltic country or Bulgaria.</P><P>The commission has been investigating these contract restrictions, believing they artificially carve up markets along national boundaries.</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark>'s concessions on this issue suggest the commission has made progress.</P><P>In a statement today, the company's deputy chairman, Alexander Medvedev, said <mark>Gazprom</mark> hopes &quot;the commission — and ultimately the markets — will respond positively to our proposal, which should allow moving the procedure forward and closing the case in the near future.&quot;</P><P>But the commission has also raised concerns that the Russian gas supplier used its market muscle as a gas supplier to control access to gas infrastructure. And this has proven problematic.</P><P>In particular, the regulator probed <mark>Gazprom</mark>'s supply agreements with Poland's state-controlled oil and gas company PGNiG that included an obligation for <mark>Gazprom</mark> to maintain control over the Yamal pipeline.</P><P>Yamal carries gas 4,196 kilometers from the vast gas fields of Western Siberia through Belarus and Poland, to customers in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.</P><P>In its official charge sheet — Statement of Objections — the commission found that control over the Yamal pipeline was governed by an agreement between Poland and Russia. This agreement mandated <mark>Gazprom</mark> to keep control over the pipeline.</P><P>And that's where the commission's competition enforcement came unstuck.</P><H4>Compelled by the state</H4><P>In the Yamal case, <mark>Gazprom</mark> was able to argue that it was acting under &quot;state compulsion&quot; and wasn't responsible for its behavior. Under EU rules, antitrust law can't be applied when companies' decisions are dictated by agreements between governments.</P><P>State-owned companies often invoke this argument. For example, in the commission's probe of illegal agreements between airlines to fix fees for transporting cargo, some state-owned companies argued in 2008 that antitrust rules couldn't apply because national laws required them to arrange prices with competitors.</P><P>In the <mark>Gazprom</mark> case, EU officials argue that the Polish-Russian agreement applies to only a &quot;narrow&quot; aspect of its case. The commission has successfully asserted its jurisdiction over other aspects of <mark>Gazprom</mark>'s behavior and obliged it to remove control over its infrastructure, they insist.</P><P>Yet today's remarks by Vestager are an admission that, on Yamal, the commission was obliged to concede defeat.</P><P>This and other attempts of the &quot;state compulsion&quot; argument are prompting the EU watchdog to go back to the drawing board with legislation to avoid similar stumbling blocks in the future.</P><P>Under a proposed law, all intergovernmental agreements will be subject to prior scrutiny by the commission. The draft bill was passed by European Parliament earlier this month and now must be approved by EU governments.</P><P>Vestager said today that the proposed legislation &quot;shows that effective competition in Central and Eastern European gas markets of course cannot be achieved by the enforcement of EU competition rules alone.&quot;</P><P>It was a frank acknowledgement on the part of the commission that EU antitrust law can only go so far. In its current form, the legislation can tackle contractual barriers and complaints that <mark>Gazprom</mark> charged excessive prices. But with government agreements, some hurdles still trip up antitrust enforcers.</P><P>That's why the commission needs to scrutinize intergovernmental deals, so companies can't argue that &quot;the state made me do it&quot; and get away with abusing their market dominance.</P><SECTION class=""share-links""><DIV class=""title"">Share this </DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>",0.0,2.0,Negative

hidden subsidies, but TMC public records offer a credible estimate.  In 2006, the <A href=""http://www.toyota.com"" class=""style6"">Toyota website</A> reported a company investment of $780.2 million in the TMMTX plant which was valued at $1.23 billion on their books —<EM>this corporate disclosure indicates that public funds and assets transferred to TMC account for close to 40 percent of the total capital investment in the Texas auto plant!</EM></P><P>Since the tax abatements are ongoing and renewable, the ultimate long range cost of the TMMTX deal to the community is inestimable.</P><P>Officials of the state of Texas justify the giveaway of public monies to corporations by citing the number of new jobs and general economic stimulus created by the businesses that receive the funds (<A href=""http://www.governor.state.tx.us"" class=""style6"">www.governor.state.tx.us</A>).  However, to understand the overall impact of globalization projects like TMMTX it is necessary to examine the assembly plant as a link in an international production chain and assess the wider impact of the chain on working people, their communities, and the global environment.</P><P><STRONG>TMMTX Operations: A Link in a Global Production Chain</STRONG></P><P>The TMMTX assembly plant is the focal point of a complex production chain that extends thousands of miles and has links to mines and manufacturing plants in the Far East, Mexico, and the southern U.S.  It also has technological links to locations in Japan and the U.S. Midwest to access product engineering, production control, etc.  The assembly plant is also the hub of an extensive transcontinental and export transportation network.</P><P>The strategic geographic location of TMMTX provides the company direct access to the low-cost south Texas labor market for assembly workers while insuring just-in-time delivery of cut-rate parts manufactured in the Far East and Mexico and subassemblies from other southern U.S. plants and providing convenient access to the U.S. auto market.</P><P>The production end of the chain concretely illustrates the driving force of globalization — to maximize profits by lowering labor costs.  The relative cost of labor is the primary determinant in the location of every link in the chain.  As many manufacturing operations as possible are completed in offshore labor markets, while the final assembly of the vehicles is conducted using some of the cheapest labor available in the U.S.  Furthermore, the extensive use of automation technology in the TMMTX plant keeps the use of local labor to a minimum.</P><P>Promoters of globalization tout the Tundra production chain as a paradigm of efficiency and a compelling argument for this latest manifestation of mega-capitalism.  However, the efficiency of global manufacturing, like any other capitalist enterprise, is measured by a single criterion — the revenue it produces for stockholders.  Any analysis which takes the overall impact of globalization into account leads to a far different conclusion.</P><P>The impact of globalization on the corporation itself is a good starting point for such an investigation.</P><P><STRONG>Impact I: The Corporation </STRONG></P><P>TMC advertises its production operations as the most efficient in the auto industry and describes its system as “lean manufacturing.”  Lean manufacturing is defined as “the production of the maximum number of sellable products or services at the lowest operational cost.”  The system stresses teamwork, flexibility, and constant evaluation in order to maximize “throughput,” the rate at which the system generates revenue through sales.  According to the corporation, the success of Toyota, including TMMTX, is the direct result of lean manufacturing.</P><P><EM>The case study of TMMTX exposes the myth of lean manufacturing.  Looking beyond the corporate rhetoric at the actual establishment and operation of TMMTX indicates that the extensive exploitation of cheap labor, both on- and offshore, and the substantial reduction of operational costs through state and local subsidies and tax abatements boost company revenues far more than the manufacturing practices in the plant, no matter how efficient they actually might be.</EM></P><P>There is no doubt that globalization has benefited TMC at TMMTX and its other subsidiaries — the corporation reported profits of more than $15 billion worldwide in 2007 and anticipates continuing growth and increasing profits.  The phenomenal “throughput” and profits of Toyota, however, must be measured against the impact of globalization on working people, their communities, and the environment.</P><P><STRONG>Impact II: Labor</STRONG></P><P>The success of globalization has clearly been at the expense of working people in North America and around the world.  The imperative of globalization to exploit cheap labor markets has created conditions that are undermining labor on two distinct levels: first, by creating competition for work <EM>between</EM> the workers of different regional labor markets; and second, by stratifying workers <EM>within</EM> regional labor markets.</P><P>The case study of TMMTX demonstrates the partition of labor on both levels.</P><P>Chart 1 reports auto industry production wages in the United States and Mexico and depicts the globalized context in which TMMTX operates.</P><P>The regional disparity of wages depicted in chart 1 is stark.  Midwestern U.S. assembly workers currently receive the top wages in the industry at an average of $26/hour.  The sliding globalized pay scale is step — the average pay of southern U.S. assembly workers is $13.25/hour, slightly over half (51 percent) of the wages of workers in the Midwest.  Mexican auto assemblers are at the bottom of the tiered labor market, making an average of $3.25/hour, a paltry 13 percent of the wages of their counterparts in the Midwest and less than 25 percent of assembly wages in the southern U.S.</P><P>Chart 1 also shows that the average wages of parts workers is about one half that of assembly workers in both countries.  Mexican parts workers, making an average $1.75/hour, receive the lowest wages in the globalized North American industry, a mere 16 percent of the wages of parts workers in the Midwest ($11/hour).</P><P>The absence of a category for southern U.S. parts manufacturing in chart 1 is accounted for by the fact that southern U.S. plants, including TMMTX, rely primarily on Mexican factories for the bulk of their parts (see map 1).  The proximity of this source of cheap auto parts is, in fact, a chief consideration in the location of new assembly plants.</P><P><EM>Chart 1 documents the primary drive behind the globalization of the North American auto industry and its southward migration — the relentless pursuit of cheap wages.</EM></P><P>Relocation of manufacturing plants (and threats of relocation), the backbone of capital’s strategy against labor in North America for the last 60 years, has now been fully realized through various globalization schemes and agreements like the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which offers multinational corporations virtually unrestricted access to national and regional labor markets.</P><P>While pitting the workers of different regions against each other has been a boon to automakers, overall it has been an unmitigated disaster for labor.  The impact of the globalization of the North American auto industry on labor in the Midwest has been devastating and includes the following consequences:</P><UL><LI><EM>The decimation of the United Auto Workers (UAW), formerly one on the strongest unions in North America.</EM></LI><LI><EM>Declining auto industry employment in the Midwest</EM><EM>and Canada</EM>. </LI><LI><EM>Continuing reduction of wages, benefits, and working conditions in the Midwest under the threat of further offshoring</EM>. </LI><LI><EM>Deteriorating economic welfare and security for all workers in the Midwest</EM>.</LI></UL><P>Though the impact of globalization on the traditional manufacturing regions is well documented (see “Globalization Now: The North American Auto Industry Goes South” at http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/vogel161007.html), successful confrontation with the system also requires recognition of the divisive impact of globalization <EM>within</EM> regional labor markets.</P><P>On the regional level, multinational corporations maintain control of labor markets primarily through the payment of carefully calculated <EM>surwages </EM>(wages significantly higher than average local wages but well below wages established by collective bargaining) that allow companies to manage regional wage rates and subvert attempts to unionize individual plants and entire regions.</P><P>Again, the case study of TMMTX supplies a concrete example of how this aspect of globalization works.</P><P>Chart 2 illustrates the TMMTX surwage in 2006.</P><P>Chart 2 compares the surwage paid by TMMTX to both the union assembly wage (for comparison) and the prevailing manufacturing wage paid in the San Antonio metropolitan area.   In 2006, the starting hourly wage of a TMMTX assembly line worker was $15.25/hour, a full 25 percent greater than the average local manufacturing wage ($11.55/hour).  These regional wage levels produced annual incomes of $31,720 versus $24,024/year.</P><P>The effects of the surwages on living standards in depressed labor markets are dramatic.  The fact that the poverty threshold for a family of four in the U.S. was $20,614 in 2006 puts the San Antonio wage profile in chart 2 into perspective.  $7,700/year at the bottom end of the income scale is very significant.  With the additional earnings, a working family could afford better food and healthcare.  It can also make the difference between living in a house versus an apartment, or of driving a decent car instead of a junker.</P><P>The divisive psychological effects of surwages on workers in the same plant or community are also significant.  Employees receiving surwages know that that they are in a privileged position and are put on the defensive, while those who work for less are resentful.  The partition of the working community through the strategy of paying surwages is very effective — union organizing appears as an unjustifiable risk for one side and seems futile for the other.  The abject failure of union initiatives at TMMTX (as well as other plants in the southern auto plant corridor on both sides of the border) testifies to the efficacy of the surwage strategy.</P><P>The surwage strategy has been so successful for Toyota that it is now an essential element of corporate policy.  In a five-year planning document that was leaked to the public in early 2007, the president of TEMA reiterated the company’s surwage policy and emphasized its importance for the future profitability and growth of Toyota in North America.  </P><P>Two major aspects of the impact of globalization on labor, both concretely illustrated by the TMMTX case study, can be summarized at this point:</P><UL><LI><EM>The relentless pursuit of cheap labor, which has produced mass economic displacement and <mark>devastation</mark> for working people and their communities, is the driving force behind globalization </EM>(illustrated in chart 1).  <EM>This trend </EM>(documented in map 1) <EM>clearly could not have been initiated and cannot be sustained without the collaboration of the state</EM> (shown in table 1)<EM>.</EM></LI><LI><EM>Multinational corporations maintain control of wages in regional labor markets through the payment of surwages that subvert unionization and help maintain low regional labor costs</EM> (profiled in chart 2)<EM>.  This control of regional wages, also aided and abetted by the state through anti-labor legislation, etc., is a key factor in the survival and expansion of globalization.</EM></LI></UL><P>Beyond the direct effects on workers highlighted above are the broader impacts of globalization on host communities.  Again, TMMTX provides clear examples.</P><P><STRONG>Impact III: The Community</STRONG></P><P>The economic impact of TMMTX on the community of south San Antonio parallels the impact on labor — while select individuals and groups clearly benefit from the presence of the plant in the area, the community at large is losing.  The impact on the community is most clearly seen in the area of public education.</P><P>The loss of local community educational funds is a direct consequence of the tax abatements and diversion of public funds that were included in the incentive package granted to Toyota in 2003 (see table 1).  Even before the TMMTX plant went online, the influx of new employees and their families into the community imposed increased demands on the local school district.  A financial crisis emerged less than a year after the opening of the plant.</P><P>In 2007, the Southwest Independent School District (SWISD) which depends on local taxes for most of its operating funds challenged the $700 million dollar tax valuation on the $1.2 billion Toyota plant claiming a significant loss of revenue.  On the same day that SWISD filed their challenge with the Bexar County Appraisal District (BAD) Toyota lawyers appeared before the BAD panel and also challenged the $700 million valuation, arguing that it should be <EM>lowered</EM> (to $300 million according to reports in the <EM>San Antonio Express-News</EM>).</P><P>The matter was settled when Toyota threatened to take BAD to court.  The settlement testifies to the power of multinational corporations to influence local governments: BAD reduced the valuation of the TMMTX plant $73 million to $627 million.  About the same time the state of Texas granted Toyota still another tax break for installing <mark>pollution</mark> control equipment that reduced the valuation by another $52 million to $575 million.</P><P>Because of the revaluation and tax abatements included in the original incentive package, SWISD received only $2.86 million in school taxes from Toyota for 2007.  That figure will be reduced by over two-thirds in 2008 and subsequent years because the 2007 tax bill included a one-time $2 million payment that was part of the original tax agreement.</P><P>In the long run, the children and families of the SWISD will receive little, if any, social benefit from TMMTX being located in their community.  The tax abatements granted to TMMTX and the company’s refusal to do its share to support local education stands in stark contrast to the millions of dollars of public funds that the corporation received from all levels of government to train TMMTX workers before the plant opened (see table 1).</P><P>The presence of TMMTX in south San Antonio has had similar impact on the entire spectrum of the social infrastructure of the community from healthcare to housing.  However, a comprehensive accounting of community impact is beyond the scope of this study.</P><P>An overview of the environmental impact of the Toyota Tundra production chain rounds out the picture of the overall consequences of globalization.</P><P><STRONG>Impact IV: The Environment</STRONG></P><P>The case study of TMMTX also illustrates how globalization contributes significantly to mounting environmental damage.  While TMMTX has been recognized (and further subsidized) by the state of Texas for being an environmentally responsible manufacturing plant, map 2 reveals that most of the Tundra production chain operates beyond the jurisdiction of any effective environmental protection agency, and, on the global level, Toyota worldwide operations contribute significantly to two environmentally ruinous trends.</P><P>First, globalization allows the externalization of industrial <mark>pollution</mark> by locating dirty manufacturing processes in countries with no environmental restrictions or lax enforcement of existing laws.  Thus, while the Toyota assembly plant qualifies for tax breaks from the state of Texas for the installation of the latest <mark>pollution</mark> control equipment, it is utilizing parts and materials produced offshore under unregulated conditions.  Auto batteries manufactured in Mexico and steel products mined and fabricated in the Far East are but two examples.</P><P>The second trend of environmental damage exacerbated by globalization is shipping industry <mark>pollution</mark>, a largely hidden but burgeoning source of dangerous atmospheric contamination.  The tonnage of cargo transported by water has tripled since 1970, and, presently, ships carry more than 90 percent of the world’s commodities.  According to the International Council on Clean Transportation, ships release more sulfur dioxide, a sooty pollutant associated with acid rain, into the air than all of the world’s cars, trucks, and busses combined, and the American Chemical Society estimates that air <mark>pollution</mark> from the shipping industry is causing 60,000 cardiopulmonary and lung-cancer deaths annually.  The EPA predicts that, at the current rate of growth of the shipping industry, oceangoing ships will generate 53 percent of the particulates, 46 percent of the nitrous oxides, and more that 94 percent of the sulfur oxides emitted by all forms of transportation in the U.S. by 2030.</P><P>It is manifestly obvious that TMC’s extensive international production chains (and all global production chains) add to the expanding shipping industry <mark>pollution</mark> that is contributing to global environmental damage and <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P align=""center"">__________</P><P><STRONG>Globalization:  The Nexus of the Megatrends </STRONG></P><P>The case study of TMMTX presents detailed concrete examples of how globalization schemes work and highlights the connections between the three megatrends of the modern world: ever expanding global production chains compound the ongoing catastrophic damage to the global environment and contribute to regional and global inequality, conditions that inevitably intensify both domestic and international political conflict.</P><P>The case study of TMMTX also exposes the essential political nature of the problem of globalization.  Examining the establishment and operation of TMMTX shows that globalization is not a product of mystical “free market” forces but the end result of active collaboration between multinational corporations and the state.</P><P>The political implications of the study of globalization are clear — globalization will have to be confronted and dismantled the same way that it was enabled — through organized and relentless ideological and political action at all levels of government from the local to the international. </P><P>Confronting globalization is a daunting task but cannot be avoided.  This challenge, the primary political contest of the 21th century, can only be

A hairline crack was discovered last week, which forced <mark>Ineos</mark> to reduce pressure in the pipeline. But the company announced Monday that it would carry out a controlled shut down after it appeared the crack had widened.</P><P>“It is a supply concern not only because the pipeline transports a significant portion of North Sea crude oil output, but also because it may take weeks before the issue is resolved,” Abhishek Kumar, Senior Energy Analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics, told <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-gains-on-forties-pipeline-shutdown-new-york-blast-idUSKBN1E501P"">Reuters</A>.</P><P>A shutdown for that length of time and of that magnitude of capacity would be a problem for any pipeline system, but a closure of this particular pipeline has global implications.</P><P>The Forties system is the main carrier of the oil that underpins the Brent crude oil benchmark, a fact reflected in the nearly 2 percent spike in Brent prices on Monday, rising above $64.50 per barrel and breaking a new two-year high.</P><P>The outage could disrupt North Sea oil supply – North Sea operators could be forced to throttle back production because of the bottleneck. According to <A href=""https://www.ft.com/content/6dfed9fb-b855-37b8-a30a-a5b6016e8523"">the FT</A>, the Forties system carries nearly 40 percent of the UK’s North Sea oil production, and it connects 85 offshore oil fields to the mainland. The BBC <A href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-42308437"">reported</A> that more than 80 oil platforms would need to shut down because of the disruption at the Forties system. <SPAN style=""color: #800000;""><STRONG class=""related""><A href=""https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/OilCoin-Worlds-First-Compliant-Cryptocurrency.html"">Related: OilCoin: The World’s First Compliant Cryptocurrency</A></STRONG></SPAN></P><P>As of Monday, some reports of announced shut downs <A href=""https://twitter.com/OilSheppard/status/940284844126466048"">started to trickle in</A>.</P><P>The outage has echoes of the spill at the <A href=""https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/WTI-Prices-Surge-On-Keystone-Spill.html"">Keystone pipeline</A> from just a few weeks ago, a crucial artery that carries nearly 600,000 bpd from Canada to the U.S. The shutdown of the pipeline caused WTI prices to surge and pushed WTI futures into a state of backwardation, in which near-term prices trade at a premium to longer-dated futures. It was the first time in three years that the WTI futures curve was downward sloping, which is a sign of tightness in the market.</P><P>But the ramifications for the outage at the Forties could be even more significant, given the much greater influence of the Brent benchmark on global prices. Assuming the 450,000-bpd pipeline remains shut for three weeks, a rough calculation would mean that up to 10 million barrels could be disrupted. That is important because OECD crude inventories stood only 140 million barrels above the five-year average, according to the latest data from the IEA for September.</P><P>The UK will need to purchase crude from elsewhere to make up for the shortfall. That could tighten the oil market in the Atlantic Basin, an area that already was feeling more pressure as the global market continued towards rebalancing. The market for Brent will be pretty jittery for the next few weeks, and an unexpected outage from Nigeria, for example, could really send things through the roof.</P><P>The outage will also widen the Brent-WTI disparity again, which had narrowed a bit after several weeks of hovering at multi-year highs. As of midday trading on Monday, Brent jumped to a nearly $7-per-barrel premium over WTI, a differential that is up nearly $1/barrel from last week. <SPAN style=""color: #800000;""><STRONG class=""related""><A href=""https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/International/Will-Libya-Be-First-To-Ditch-The-OPEC-Production-Deal.html"">Related: Will Libya Be First To Ditch The OPEC Production Deal?</A></STRONG></SPAN></P><P> </P><P>(Click to enlarge)</P><P>A wider price disparity, in turn, will lead to even sharper demand for U.S. crude, which becomes more attractive to buyers as Brent gets more expensive. As a knock-on effect from the outage of the Forties system, the U.S. could see higher oil exports in the next few weeks, which will help drain inventories at a faster clip.</P><P>In short, the crack in the Forties pipeline will have ripple effects throughout the oil market, and it will be felt across the globe until it is repaired.</P><P>By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.com</P><P><STRONG>More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:</STRONG></P></DIV></PICTURE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1.0,1.0,Negative

But this fails to elucidate the dilemma that Cook actually faces. He is indeed focusing on the bottom line by taking the actions that he does on these very issues. It's just that he can't actually stand up and <A href=""http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/tim-cook-soundly-rejects-politics-of-the-ncppr-suggests-group-sell-apples-s"">say that</A>.</P><P>As <A href=""http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/tim-cook-soundly-rejects-politics-of-the-ncppr-suggests-group-sell-apples-s"">reported</A> in The Mac Observer:
</P><BLOCKQUOTE>[Cook] didn't stop there, however, as he looked directly at the NCPPR representative and said, &quot;If you want me to do things only for ROI reasons, you should get out of this stock.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE><P>It was a clear rejection of the climate change denial, anything-for-the-sake-of-profits politics espoused by the NCPPR. It was also an unequivocal message that Apple would continue to invest in sustainable energy and related areas.</P><P>The other shareholders clearly agreed that such issues should continue to motivate Apple's actions: 97 percent of them voted against the original proposal that the company should not take regard of these matters.
And yes, sure, I sign up to Milton Friedman's idea that a company should be viewed as having one purpose and one purpose only, which is to enrich its shareholders. With a couple of obvious caveats, legality for example, playing their part. However, and here's the dilemma, it's not actually obvious that Apple's activities in green and climate change matters do not in fact add to the bottom line.</P><P>Let's think through the things that it actually does. First, its commitment to the use of renewable energy. Whether solar and Bloom Boxes at the data centre in North Carolina, or in their other offices, there's no indication that this costs more than other energy sources. Sure, green power isn't economically viable in most places (although in some locations and uses it is) but it's not actually the consumer of the power that ends up paying that extra cost. Subsidy systems vary but almost all of them have either the taxpayer or <EM>all</EM> power consumers paying the extra costs. Things like feed in tariffs and guaranteed prices for renewable electricity mean that all power consumers on the grid are paying the higher costs of that type of power, not just the people who are saying that they're using green power. So while society as a whole might be paying some extra amount for Apple to be using renewables it's not in fact Apple that is.</P><P>Given my background in the minerals trade I'm also interested in Apple's work on conflict minerals. Yes, the company just announced that its tantalum supplies (used to make capacitors) are now free of material sourced from slaves and child workers in the DR Congo. But it's worth noting that it's done this the cheap and sensible way, through the industry smelter initiative, not the expensive and stupid way proposed by the Enough Project and Global Witness and written into Dodd Frank. A few millions (and it won't have been more than that) to gain the marketing and bragging rights to being conflict free could very well add, not detract, from the bottom line.</P><P>There are, however, other areas where Apple clearly doesn't take the environmentally righteous path. For example, all iPads and iPhones are flown from the manufacturing plants to the distribution warehouses. The reason is that the interest on stock is higher than the air freight costs. So, it's actually cheaper, costs less overall, to fly than ship them by sea. And CO2 emissions be damned where the bottom line is concerned.</P><P>Similarly, the teardown companies regularly castigate Apple for building shiny shiny that it almost impossible to upgrade, repair or even recycle. One example is the practice of gluing batteries into place meaning that once you've gone through the battery's lifespan of recharges you've got to junk the entire device. Very sustainable that is: but also highly profitable for the company, which gets to sell you a new one.</P><P>A closer examination thus seems to show us that Apple does indulge peoples' green fantasies when it doesn't cost them much if any money and entirely ignores such greenwashing when it might indeed affect that profit line.</P><P>And that, really, is Cook's dilemma. He knows this, he's a sharp enough cookie, but he cannot actually stand up and say so. The golden glow that the company gets when Greenpeace lauds its commitment to renewables is worth money in the bank. For there's a large enough portion of us mug punters who will decide how to spend our money based upon such considerations. But Cook cannot actually say that Apple only does the easy stuff that doesn't cost anything for this will  shatter that carefully created illusion that they're not a rapaciously capitalist company focused purely on that bottom line.</P><P>Therefore, when Cook is asked by some activist why he's wasting money on greenery and not running the company purely for profit Cook cannot tell him the truth. That the company is being run for profit as it only does that amount of greenery that improves the profit margin and it most certainly doesn't do anything that actually costs.

Similarly the petrochemicals sector requires competitively priced feedstocks.</P><P class=""Para"">1.2 Since the 1970’s North Sea oil and gas has provided the petrochemical industry with advantaged ethane and liquefied petroleum gases (propane and butane) feedstocks that have seen a successful petrochemical manufacturing industry grow based on a competitive olefins (ethylene and propylene) market. </P><P class=""Para"">1.3 This has been able to support downstream derivative manufacturing even though such products may be disadvantaged by distribution costs. UK derivatives today are exposed to global competition from low cost regions such as United States and Middle East E. The UK derivative portfolio (polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene vinyl chloride (PVC), ethanol, ethyl acetate (ETAC) and vinyl acetate monomer (VAM) in particular) cannot compete with low cost product unless the upstream feeds are competitive. Therefore, if feed costs into UK olefins manufacturing were to level with the rest of Europe, these derivatives would be outcompeted not only by their US and ME competitors, but also lose out against mainland European competitors who would then have similar costs but more differentiated derivatives and lower freight costs to serve the market.</P><P class=""Para"">1.4 Production forecasts for these advantaged petrochemical feedstocks from the North Sea show a marked decline at the end of this decade. Without a replacement advantaged feedstock the inevitable decline in UK olefins manufacturing industry, and therefore the associated downstream derivatives, is likely to follow.</P><P class=""Para"">1.5 For many years the UK has had access to locally sourced supplies of natural gas which have provided consumers with competitively priced energy supplies. As conventional reserves have declined, however, UK import dependency has increased with ever-greater volumes of gas being sourced from Norway and through LNG. As a result UK natural gas prices have become increasingly uncompetitive on a global scale.</P><P class=""Para"">1.6 The Government recognises that natural gas will play a vital part in the UK’s energy mix in the medium term (for both power generation and heat) ahead of the wider development of new nuclear and renewables.</P><P class=""Para"">1.7 In sharp contrast to the UK, the USA has seen energy and feedstock prices fall, import facilities converted for exportation and a rapid growth in petrochemicals manufacture all due to the extraction of shale gas. Furthermore, with gas prices falling below coal prices, the United States has seen overall CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions fall significantly as power generation switches to natural gas where possible.</P><P class=""Para"">1.8 It is clear that the UK potentially has very significant reserves of shale gas based on the results of surveys to date. It is likely that the UK’s shale deposits could contain higher weight hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s—essential feedstocks for the petrochemicals industry. Shale Gas deposits can contain these higher molecular-weight hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s (in addition to natural gas) that would re-invigorate the UK olefins and derivatives petrochemicals market. </P><P class=""Para"">1.9 <mark>INEOS</mark> believe it is this step change in advantaged feedstock for the petrochemicals market in the UK that is required and we will actively pursue both the import of such materials (in the short term) and the availability of UK supplies (in the long term) to maintain our UK manufacturing base</P><P class=""Para"">1.10 UK shale reserves have the potential to provide the UK with a secure, indigenous and highly competitive source of energy and hydro<mark>carbon</mark> feedstocks—in essence providing a replacement for declining output from conventional North Sea reserves. Rather than requiring support and subsidy (like renewables), or requiring energy to be bought externally, UK shale would provide a vital source of income to UK plc.</P><P class=""Para"">1.11 The UK energy intensive and petrochemicals sectors require certainty that energy and feedstocks will be secure and competitive in the medium term. Without that certainty then it is likely that these sectors will decline and reducing the manufacturing capacity. However if shale develops positively then the prospects for manufacturing to build and grow on the current significant UK supply infrastructure are good.</P><P class=""Para"">1.12 The UK has a proven track record of technological development in oil and gas production and manufacturing. Recent reports show that shale gas is no riskier than current fuel extraction technologies and can be managed safely.</P><P class=""Para"">1.13 It is vital that UK government supports and encourages the responsible development of shale gas.</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading"">2. <SPAN class=""smallcaps"">The Importance of Natural Gas and Hydro<mark>carbon</mark> Feedstocks</SPAN></H2><P class=""Para"">2.1 For many years natural gas has been a key part of the UK’s primary fuel mix. Large indigenous reserves in the North Sea have provided the UK with a competitive source of energy for power generation.</P><P class=""Para"">2.2 In addition to natural gas, the North Sea provides other hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s such as ethane and propane which are vital feedstocks for the petrochemicals and plastics industry. Availability of these feedstocks has resulted in the UK having had a successful petrochemicals sector.</P><P class=""Para"">2.3 However forecasts of these fundamental advantaged feedstocks show a steep decline at the turn of the decade. It is imperative that alternatives are found to sustain UK manufacturing and exports in these sectors.</P><P class=""Para"">2.4 The so called “dash for gas” saw a transformation of the power generation industry with the widespread displacement of coal resulting in a significant fall in UK <mark>carbon</mark> emissions.</P><P class=""Para"">2.5 UK government policy is to further de<mark>carbon</mark>ise the UK economy—and much of this will have to be achieved through the de<mark>carbon</mark>isation of the power generation sector. </P><P class=""Para"">2.6 In the medium term the UK Government recognises that natural gas will continue to play a vital role in power generation, both as a back-up for interruptible renewables and ahead of the deployment of a new generation of nuclear stations in UK (excluding Scotland) and Scottish Governments off shore wind and wave generation.</P><P class=""Para"">2.7 As a critical “bridging fuel” it is essential that natural gas prices remain competitive in the UK Gas prices determine wholesale electricity prices and critically important for the energy intensive sector.</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading"">3. <SPAN class=""smallcaps"">UK and the US—Contrasting Recent History of Natural Gas</SPAN></H2><P class=""Para"">3.1 Following the discovery of natural gas in the North Sea, the UK for many years enjoyed the benefits of plentiful gas supplies. This resulted in gas prices which were relatively competitive. The construction of the UK to Belgium interconnector also enabled large volumes of gas to be sold and exported to the wider European market.</P><P class=""Para"">3.2 During the mid 2010’s UK indigenous production was seen to decline quite rapidly as field depletion exceeded new discoveries. As a result the UK has moved to becoming a net gas importer. This has resulted in prices being on average higher and exposed to external global factors.</P><P class=""Para"">3.3 In particular the UK is now increasingly dependent upon imports of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). While there is no recognised global market for LNG (as there is for oil for example) it is very clear that the price and availability of LNG is affected by the global supply and demand balance and other risk factors. For example following the global financial collapse of 2008, LNG availability kept UK prices relatively low and competitive whereas after the Fukushima nuclear incident, increased demand for LNG has seen a significantly tightening of the LNG market and prices increasing.</P><P class=""Para"">3.4 This tightening of the LNG supply/demand balance has caused UK prices to rise significantly. (Price evolution is shown in Addendum 1).</P><P class=""Para"">3.5 Natural gas prices have now risen above the equivalent cost of coal for the generation of power. This has resulted in power generators increasing power generation on coal stations and reducing generation on gas stations. With coal stations emitting more <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide per unit of power generated, this has resulted in UK emissions increasing (we estimate that UK CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions increased by around 25 million tonnes in 2011 alone).</P><P class=""Para"">3.6 The gas price is critical in determining the price of wholesale electricity. Increasing wholesale gas prices have caused wholesale electricity prices to increase. With the UK generation mix being more dependent on gas than most of other European markets, this has resulted in UK wholesale prices rising to highly uncompetitive levels. When tax policy is taken into account the situation in the UK is even worse. (Electricity price comparisons are shown in Addendum 2).</P><P class=""Para"">3.7 In the United States the situation is nearly the complete reverse. In the late 2010s the US expected that it would need to import large quantities of LNG and as a result a number of import terminals were built.</P><P class=""Para"">3.8 At the same time, advances were made in the recovery of shale gas. Development was so rapid that by the time terminals were constructed, US shale gas production had grown enough that imports were simply not required and the new terminals remained very largely unused.</P><P class=""Para"">3.9 The growth of shale gas also pushed prices down very significantly—far more than many had predicted. The contrast is now stark with the US enjoying natural gas prices which are around 30% of the levels we see in the UK. </P><P class=""Para"">3.10 In addition to the extraction of natural gas (methane), large quantities of larger hydro<mark>carbon</mark> molecules are being extracted (ethane and propane). This advantaged feedstock has helped to drive a resurgence in US olefin production and the downstream olefin-derivative industries. The next few years will see the US bring on line olefin production based on shale gas, and will see the US challenge the Middle East for the title of low-cost producer of olefins and therefore olefin-derivatives.</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading"">4. <SPAN class=""smallcaps"">Impact of Shale in the US</SPAN></H2><P class=""Para"">4.1 The growth of shale gas in the US has had profound impacts.</P><P class=""Para"">4.2 The increased availability of chemical feedstocks has seen investment increase significantly in ethane crackers announced. For example on 1 June 2012 ICIS Heren reported that “US-based ExxonMobil Chemical’s announcement of a new 1.5m tonne/year cracker in Texas by 2016 brings the tally of new US ethylene capacity announcements to 33% of existing capacity”<I>. </I></P><P class=""Para"">4.3 US natural gas prices have fallen dramatically and are now around the lowest in the world—certainly of the transparent liquidly traded markets. </P><P class=""Para"">4.4 Rather than being a net importer, the US is now expected to be a net gas exporter, with a number of major liquefaction projects announced (in part using the terminals that were constructed to import gas). Thus, rather than exporting money to buy gas, the US will have a large new revenue stream.</P><P class=""Para"">4.5 Lower gas prices have resulted in a lowering of electricity prices, giving a massive competitive advantage to the US electro-intensive industries </P><P class=""Para"">4.6 Natural gas is now more competitive than coal for power generation in the US—so gas has displaced coal in the power generation sector. As a result the US has seen a significant reduction in CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions.</P><P class=""Para"">4.7 There are a number of other reports that show the impact of shale gas is having on the US manufacturing sector which is now clearly growing. Selections of these are quoted in Addendum 4.</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading"">5. <SPAN class=""smallcaps"">Shale Gas Potential in the UK</SPAN></H2><P class=""Para"">5.1 Shale gas in the UK has the ability to be transformational in delivering secure and competitive energy and feedstock supplies which are vital for the energy intensive and petrochemicals sectors. </P><P class=""Para"">5.2 It is apparent, albeit on limited surveys that the UK has significant and world class shale deposits. The Bowland shale for example is reported to be five times the thickness of the Marcellus shale in the US.</P><P class=""Para"">5.3 Technically, there are reports from respected bodies that shale extraction can be achieved with no greater risk than current extractive technologies. Indeed the UK has well established arrangements in a wide variety of industries for responsibly managing environmental and other risks. The US has demonstrated the technology which should be readily transferable. Indeed, shale gas extraction has been undertaken in Germany for many years without technical or environmental issues.</P><P class=""Para"">5.4 Furthermore, the UK has a very strong track record when it comes to putting new infrastructure in place. The development of a massive oil and gas production and transmission infrastructure was achieved in a relatively short period in arguably a much more challenging environment. There is no reason to suggest that given the right <mark>climate</mark> that this could not be replicated for shale gas production.</P><P class=""Para"">5.5 The UK should be looking to achieve “first mover” advantage. With an established gas and petrochemicals infrastructure already in place we only require a competitive source of supply to replace dwindling indigenous North Sea reserves to sustain our remaining energy intensive and petrochemicals sectors. </P><P class=""Para"">5.6 The benefits to industry are only part of the story with many wider spin-off benefits, which seem certain to enhance the prospects of the UK manufacturing and wider economy.</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading"">6 <SPAN class=""smallcaps"">Conclusions</SPAN></H2><P class=""Para"">6.1 UK olefins manufacturing in the UK is sustained by advantaged feedstock pricing from North Sea gases (ethane, propane and butane) that provides support to the associated UK olefins derivatives manufacturing base (that are disadvantaged by greater transportation and freight costs to the inland European market). If feed costs into UK olefins manufacturing were to level with the rest of Europe, these derivatives would be outcompeted not only by their US and ME competitors, but also lose out against mainland European competitors who would then have similar costs but more differentiated derivatives and lower freight costs to serve the market. New sources of advantaged feedstock are required to maintain a UK olefins and derivatives manufacturing base.</P><P class=""Para"">6.2  UK energy prices are already uncompetitive. The UK’s energy tax and policy framework indicate that the competiveness gap is only set to increase.</P><P class=""Para"">6.3 For energy intensive manufacturers, such as olefins and derivatives producers, energy is a major component of productions costs: accessing competitively priced energy is simply business critical.</P><P class=""Para"">6.4 Shale gas offers an opportunity that must not be rejected if the UK is to remain a competitive location for energy intensive industries.</P><P class=""Para"">6.5 <mark>INEOS</mark> strongly supports the responsible development of shale gas in the UK. We consider it vital to the long-term success of our manufacturing operations in the UK.</P><P class=""Para"">6.6 We encourage UK Government to support the development of shale gas. Unlike renewables and new nuclear, this support will not need to be financial. Rather the need will be in areas such as licensing and planning. Indeed, UK plc will reap massive financial benefit from a successful shale gas industry.</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading"">7 <SPAN class=""smallcaps"">Responses to Questions</SPAN></H2><P class=""Para"">In response to the questions raised by the Committee we have provided comments below (where we feel it is appropriate to comment).</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading""><I>What are the estimates for the amount of shale gas in place in the UK, Europe, and the rest of the world, and what proportion is recoverable? </I></H2><P class=""Para"">We are not experts in this area and only have access to information that has been made publically available.</P><P class=""Para"">In the UK it is apparent that information on reserves is evolving as test drilling is required in order to gather concrete information on shale quality. It is apparent that views are changing rapidly but generally new information is leading to ever more optimistic forecasts.</P><P class=""Para"">The proportion of recoverable reserves is also uncertain. However, assuming conservatively that just 10% of reserves are recoverable then we estimate that the Bowland Shale has the capacity to produce 30% of the volume of gas that has been extracted from UK conventional fields since 1970. In view of this we think it is reasonable to say that extracting shale gas would be comparable to rediscovering the North Sea. </P><P class=""Para"">Globally, new information is published on a near daily basis indicating that massive shale deposits lie across the planet. China, for example has the largest reserves, and with a gas market of similar size to the UK, reserves to demand ratios are around 250 years.</P><P class=""Para"">Germany also has significant reserves and with shale extraction having been undertaken for many years, we anticipate that shale development will see further growth.</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading""><I>Why are the estimates for shale gas so changeable? </I></H2><P class=""Para"">We are not experts but exploration to date is limited. As exploration continues it is apparent that shale deposits are large, tend to surpass expectations and are globally diverse.</P><P class=""Para"">It is clear that other countries are likely to pursue shale development (as the US has done) and we see it as essential that the UK, with a strong track record on gas production and an existing good infrastructure that we seize early mover advantage.</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading""><I>What are the prospects for offshore shale gas in the UK Continental Shelf? </I></H2><P class=""Para"">We have no particular view on the relative merits of off-shore versus on-shore shale gas extraction. However, in either case we think it essential that UK Government support the development of the industry particularly through the granting of exploration and development licences.</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading""><I>Should the UK consider setting up a wealth fund with the tax revenue from shale gas? </I></H2><P class=""Para"">We have no strong view on the merits of setting up specifically a wealth fund. However, it is apparent that the UK economy will boosted significantly if we continue to produce (and potentially export) indigenous gas rather than import supplies from other parts of the globe at higher and uncompetitive prices.</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading""><I>What have been the effects of shale gas on the LNG industry? </I></H2><P class=""Para"">As already discussed, the US will become a gas exporter of natural gas. Others will follow. Better that the UK is an early mover.</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading""><I>Could shale gas lead to the emergence of a single, global gas market? </I></H2><P class=""Para"">Potentially shale could improve the prospects of a global gas market developing. However, if we do not embrace indigenous shale gas extraction we will remain a large importer forced to accept prices and exposed to geo-political risk.</P><P class=""Para"">Further, local gas production has the very clear potential to grow local industry through production and providing competitive energy and feedstock supplies for energy intensive and petrochemical sectors.</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading""><I>What are the effects on investment in lower-<mark>carbon</mark> energy technologies? </I></H2><P class=""Para"">The development of shale gas should be seen as providing the bridge to a lower <mark>carbon</mark> economy. UK <mark>carbon</mark> emissions were reduced massively in the period known as “the dash for gas”. We have already noted that with gas prices currently higher than coal, <mark>carbon</mark> emissions in 2011 were higher than they would otherwise have been.</P><P class=""Para"">Further, it is clear that the deployment of significant levels of low <mark>carbon</mark> generation infrastructure remains many years away. Renewables will inevitably require back-up generation and any new nuclear seems very unlikely before 2020. Gas will be required to provide the bridge in the short to medium term—and shale gas can provide this without the need for expensive economic support mechanisms. </P><P class=""Para"">In the long term, whether gas will affect the deployment of new nuclear and renewables will have to be determined by policy and economic views. For example, will cheap gas combined with <mark>Carbon</mark> Capture and Storage provide a more economic, secure and acceptable source of power generation?</P><P class=""Para"">Predicting the future is without question uncertain. However, shale gas can offer another route to secure, competitive and lower <mark>carbon</mark> energy—and it should not be ruled out of the energy mix at this stage</P><H2 class=""writtenHeading""><I>What is the potential impact on <mark>climate change</mark> objectives of greater use of shale gas?</I></H2><P class=""Para"">Again the US offers a view of potential benefits. We note two examples.</P><P class=""Para"">First, shale gas has lowered prices such that natural gas is now the preferred fuel for power generation. As a result US <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions have fallen massively. Increased use of shale gas in the UK or ROW has the ability to reduce coal burn provided it is cheaper than coal. </P><P class=""Para"">Secondly, gas is already being used as an alternative to liquid hydro<mark>carbon</mark> fuels, offering reductions in emissions.</P><P class=""Para"">Thus, greater use of shale gas can provide a route to lower <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by displacing use of fuels with higher <mark>carbon</mark> intensity.</P><P class=""Para"">Of course shale gas is not <mark>carbon</mark> free. While <mark>Carbon</mark> Capture and Storage is still to be proven on a commercial scale, it would be an obvious partner to shale gas in providing a zero <mark>carbon</mark> but secure energy supply in the longer term.</P><P class=""ParaFull-Out""> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",0.0,1.0,

On one hand, strict regulation is forcing automotive companies to rethink their manufacturing processes to comply with the new rules. On the other hand, a growing penetration of electric vehicles with a more environmentally conscious supply chain, puts additional pressure on the conventional car industry. Therefore, a key management concern is how to reduce <mark>CO2</mark> emissions and become more <mark>sustainable</mark> across all of the company’s processes. Supply chain processes are key in this strategy since traditional supply chain emissions can be greater than those from direct operations.</P><P><mark>BMW</mark> is the example of a company that is redefining its business model in reaction to the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>. In 2016, <mark>BMW</mark> was named the world’s most <mark>sustainable</mark> automotive company by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index<A href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"">[1]</A>. The company aims to reduce at least 50% of its <mark>CO2</mark> emissions by 2020<A href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"">[2]</A>. In order to do so, <mark>BMW</mark> is focusing on four key areas of its business supply chain.</P><P><STRONG><EM>Development of a <mark>sustainable</mark> strategy and organization in supply chain</EM></STRONG><EM> </EM></P><P><mark>BMW</mark>’s 2020 vision includes sustainability as a key area of development. <EM>The <mark>BMW</mark> Group is the most successful and s<U>ustainable</U> premium provider of individual mobility<A href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3""><STRONG>[3]</STRONG></A>.</EM> To achieve its vision, the company has created a Sustainability Board that is in charge of executing the sustainability strategy and cascading it to the rest of the organization. Specifically, in supply chain, the company has set its 2020 goal to <EM>Develop</EM><EM>a <mark>sustainable</mark> resource efficient supply chain<A href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4""><STRONG>[4]</STRONG></A></EM>.  To execute its goal the company has established a decentralized sustainability team in the supply chain area with key short term and medium-term goals.</P><P><STRONG><EM>Increased supply chain transparency</EM></STRONG></P><P>By 2020 The <mark>BMW</mark> Group plans to increase supply chain transparency through the <EM>Supplier Sustainability Standards, </EM>which establishes the minimum requirements a supplier needs to meet to work with <mark>BMW</mark>. In order to ensure compliance, the company has created an industry wide sustainability questionnaire in which it analyzes the supplier overall commitment with sustainability. The questionnaire is a key resource for decision making in the tendering process.</P><P>In addition, <mark>BMW</mark> encourages its suppliers to report their <mark>CO2</mark> emission targets. In 2016, 69% of <mark>BMW</mark>’s suppliers publicly reported their emissions<A href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"">[5]</A>. With these metrics, <mark>BMW</mark> can benchmark and push suppliers to achieve specific sustainability goals. <mark>BMW</mark>’s plan for 2020 is the requirement that all suppliers report their sustainability metrics. By doing this the company is indirectly generating competition among suppliers to become more <mark>sustainable</mark>.</P><P><STRONG><EM>Training suppliers</EM></STRONG></P><P>In order to help suppliers achieve sustainability standards, <mark>BMW</mark> has created a training program for suppliers. During 2016, more than 150 purchasers<A href=""#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"">[6]</A> participated in <mark>BMW</mark>’s trainings.  Moreover, <mark>BMW</mark> identified key suppliers with high <mark>CO2</mark> emissions and designed specific trainings for those suppliers. In addition to these training programs, <mark>BMW</mark> started a sustainability awareness program in which they participate in industry wide events with key talks on sustainability. By 2020, the company expects to increase the number of supplier trainings and expand its awareness programs to Latin America and USA.</P><P><STRONG><EM>Reduction in the consumption of key supply chain resources</EM></STRONG></P><P>In order to excel in its production processes, <mark>BMW</mark> has set a goal for the supply chain to<EM>: reduce its resource consumption (energy, water, waste, solvents) per vehicle produced by 45% by 2020<A href=""#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7""><STRONG>[7]</STRONG></A>. </EM>The role of the supply chain team to achieve this objective is to find more efficient sources of energy and to identify opportunities of vertical integration to reduce energy consumption. For instance, 63% of the company energy purchases in 2016 came from <mark>sustainable</mark> energy sources that at the same time are low <mark>CO2</mark> emissions.</P><P><STRONG><EM>Post 2020 goals</EM></STRONG></P><P>Post 2020 the company has different specific areas of action to become more <mark>sustainable</mark>: Become a leader in the electric car market, implement vertical integration of suppliers to reduce <mark>CO2</mark> emissions and monitor supplier sustainability metrics through digital platforms.<A href=""#_ftn8"" name=""_ftnref8"">[8</A></P><P><STRONG><EM>Additional suggested actions</EM></STRONG></P><P>I would recommend that <mark>BMW</mark> act across two dimensions to in response to <mark>climate change</mark> and the increased pressure on its supply chain. First, <mark>BMW</mark> should try to develop pilots for purchasing non-conventional materials for car manufacturing. For instance, develop prototypes to replace aluminum and cobalt (which are high emission sourcing processes), by more green products e.g. recycled products. As a second area of action, I believe <mark>BMW</mark> should take a more drastic approach towards suppliers that don’t comply with sustainability metrics. Specifically stop sourcing from those providers or define penalties in long term contracts if the sustainability goals are not achieved.<EM> </EM></P><P><STRONG><EM>Additional important questions:</EM></STRONG></P><P>1-What additional incentives should governments implement to shift car manufacturers’ current business models towards sustainability?</P><P>2-If the electric car is not the most cost-effective solution for car manufacturers to address <mark>climate change</mark>, what other disruptive technologies are worth exploring?</P><P>(786 words)</P><P><A href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"">[1]</A> <mark>BMW</mark> press release (Munich 8 September 2016): <mark>BMW</mark> Group once again sector leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.

Deemed as one of the biggest contributors to increased greenhouse gases, the auto industry has garnered much negative attention in regards to <mark>climate change</mark>, and Volkswagen (VW) is a prime example of an automaker rushing to reinvent themselves and stay ahead of regulations, while keeping their brand image intact.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Design of the Car</STRONG></P><P>Emissions regulations are becoming stricter by the year, especially with hard to ignore global manifestations of <mark>climate change</mark>. In addition to restrictions on fuel emissions from active machines, there are now additional restrictions on such emissions when machines are off and resting. Consequently, car manufacturers have had to redesign their cars to produce better fuel efficiency as well as improved fuel storage tanks. In their 2014 Sustainability Report, Volkswagen reported that 57 cars in their portfolio already met the 2020 EU new-fleet car emissions target of 95g CO­­<SUB>2 </SUB>/km. Furthermore, each new car VW designs promises to be 10-15% more fuel efficient than its predecessor.</P><P>Lastly, VW cars are now designed so that 85-95% of the car is recyclable; however, how the company retrieves old cars for recyclable material and how much they have used recycled material in their new cars has not been disclosed by the company.</P><P> </P><P><STRONG>Design of the Plant and Production Process</STRONG></P><P>Volkswagen reports that over the years their manufacturing process has become much more efficient and consequently, has decreased emissions from production every year. In 2014, Volkswagen reported their worldwide manufacturing processes saw an average of 23.2% reduction in CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions, 18.5% reduction in energy consumption, and a 21.7% reduction in waste for disposal. These results were achieved mainly by switching to renewable energy to power the plants, innovating processes such as painting cars to rely less on water, and recycling water and waste products in the production process. In addition, VW has attained ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 certification at many of their sites and is continuing to improve uncertified sites with the goal of achieving these certifications.</P><P><STRONG> </STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Cannibalization of their main product?</STRONG></P><P>While the fossil fuel driven car is VW’s main product, increased consumer awareness of <mark>climate change</mark> coupled with stricter regulations are forcing the company to invent eco-friendly products that may one day entirely replace what has been the bread and butter of VW:</P><OL><LI>VW is producing hybrid cars that can use both oil and electricity as fuel, and have CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions as low as 35 g/km, approximately one third of that of traditional vehicles.</LI><LI>Some Volkswagen brands such as Audi are moving towards alternative energy as fuel. The company has developed a method of producing “e-gas” which offers the same power as fossil fuels, but is generated using wind power, CO<SUB>2</SUB>, and water. Volkswagen admits that there is still lack of infrastructure around e-gas – only available at some gas stations – which has hindered customer adoption of this technology.</LI><LI>VW has been investing in car-sharing and building buses. In a time when there is increased incentivization for people to reduce emissions by using common transport, VW runs the risk of decreasing their car sales.</LI></OL><P> </P><P><STRONG>Other Considerations</STRONG></P><P>When judging the success of any sustainability endeavor, it is important to ask what is the net effect of the company’s operations on the environment and which metrics are being used measure it. For example, VW could simply use aluminum to make their cars lighter, which would in turn produce increased mileage. However, the extraction of aluminum is itself a highly energy intensive process, and so could outweigh the environmental benefits of reducing fuel consumption in cars. Additionally, although the company seemed to be performing well with regards to sustainability when measured against CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions regulations, they were 40 times over the limit for NOx emissions, and were found to be falsifying NOx emissions data, leading to the “emissiongate” scandal of 2015. This illustrates that although companies are being forced to comply to stricter environmental regulations, they are likely to feel pressured to scam their way out of such regulations or to find ways to address parts of the problem while exacerbating others.</P><P> </P><P>Finally, improving sustainability is not a simple, one-way equation. Just as companies, governments, and consumers are responsible for driving <mark>climate change</mark> to its current state, all parties must similarly be involved in undoing centuries of negligence. Companies like Volkswagen, who arguably have a more direct impact on <mark>climate change</mark>, must lead the way in creating innovative methods to reduce and even sequester CO<SUB>2</SUB>, because it is only a matter of time before both government regulations and consumer demands force change upon them.</P><P> </P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,2.0,Strongly Positive

First, Cargill’s agriculture commodity trading and processing business is largely dependent on agricultural raw materials, thus during droughts or other significant natural events, Cargill may face supply shortages.<A href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"">[3]</A> Similarly, its’ meat business has suffered significantly because droughts and increased demand for corn in cattle production regions have led farmers to decrease their herd sizes; that, coupled with the increase demand for beef, has caused prices to rise.<A href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"">[4]</A> These supply shortages lead to extreme price volatility, which forces the company to frequently mitigate risks across 7-plus commodities, which can be challenging and expensive.</P><P>While <mark>climate change</mark> puts Cargill’s supply chain at risk, the company is taking several steps in the short and medium term to position itself for sustained success. One of the most effective steps Cargill has taken is acquiring businesses like Joe White Maltings in Australia and Turyag, a Turkish fats and oils producer, to help increase the global footprint of its supply chain. Cargill is also diversifying its business by shifting toward industries that have the most promising growth and less risk tied to <mark>climate change</mark>. For instance, the company looked at projected growth for cocoa ingredients world-wide and noticed that the Asian Pacific region was the major force behind absolute volume growth. As a result, it has spent US$100 million on a new Indonesian plant, along with several other acquisitions, to improve the company’s position in serving growing demand.<SUP>3  </SUP>Cargill is also funding inventions and buying patents to explore ways to improve cell function in plants during exposure to  environmental stress.<A href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"">[5]</A> Lastly, Cargill partnered with the World Wildlife Fund, the Center for American Progress, Mars and others to use technology and “stress test the global food system in a simulation called Food Chain Reaction.” The simulation helped prove that, if corporations work together to make the world’s agriculture systems more resilient, it is possible to feed the growing population. Cargill has committed to continue to do its part in the medium to longer term by advocating for open trade, integrating sustainability measures into its operations and supply chains and applying <mark>innovation</mark> to strengthen the tools farmers need to make the most of their land. <A href=""#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"">[6]</A></P><P>There are still several additional steps Cargill can take to combat the issues it is facing because of <mark>climate change</mark>. For instance, the company should focus more of its resources on lobbying for more mandatory <mark>sustainable</mark> growth practices world-wide; this will benefit not only the food and agricultural industry but also the citizens of the world. Similarly, the company should lobby both to GAAP and IFRS for international tax-credits for the development of additional innovative breakthroughs; this will encourage companies to fund research and create patents just like Cargill did to improve the cells of plants’ ability to survive under significant  environmental stress. Additionally, the company should invest more aggressively to expand its operations into emerging markets; this will help mitigate the risk of limited supply in a given region while also contributing to more top-line growth.</P><P>After conducting this research, one of the biggest open questions I have is as consolidation in the food and agriculture industry continues to happen, what are the unintended consequences that may worsen the issues <mark>climate change</mark> has had on supply chains? If an oligopoly were to form, what laws could governments put in place to ensure that food is still affordable? Separately, are there more aggressive laws or generous incentives governments can implement to ensure more <mark>sustainable</mark> farming and distribution practices?</P><P>Word count: 788</P><P> </P><P> </P><P><A href=""#_ftnref1"" name=""_ftn1"">[1]</A> United Nations Environment Programme, “GEO-5 for Business: Impacts of a Channing Environment on the Corporate Sector” (PDF File), downloaded from <A href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/world/geo-5-business-impacts-changing-environment-corporate-sector"">https://reliefweb.int/report/world/geo-5-business-impacts-changing-environment-corporate-sector</A>, accessed November 4, 2017.</P><P><A href=""#_ftnref2"" name=""_ftn2"">[2]</A> Engel, Hauke et al., “How companies can adapt to <mark>climate change</mark>,” McKinsey &amp; Company Sustainability &amp; Resource Productivity, July 2015, <A href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability-and-resource-productivity/our-insights/how-companies-can-adapt-to-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability-and-resource-productivity/our-insights/how-companies-can-adapt-to-<mark>climate</mark>-change</A>, accessed November 4, 2017.</P><P><A href=""#_ftnref3"" name=""_ftn3"">[3]</A> Source: <mark>Cargill Inc</mark>.

In a series of articles over the coming months, we will explore the question of how digitalization can be done “on purpose” — that is, how we can ensure that digitalization will be a force for good, a force to transform economies so that they foster greater equity, environmental integrity, and shared global prosperity. </P><P>This article sets out to define the terms <EM>digitization, digitalization</EM>, and <EM>digital transformation</EM> so that they can serve as a framework for understanding how the digital revolution can also become a revolution for <mark>sustainable</mark> development. It represents a first step in helping leaders purposefully guide their organizations toward a better digital future.</P><H3>The Digitalization Blitzkrieg</H3><P>The progressive digitalization of industries is causing anxiety in C-suites around the world. Wave after wave of digitalization — publishing, music, film, banking — has disrupted multibillion-dollar industries. It is now upending retail, as companies like <mark>Amazon.com Inc.</mark> leave a trail of zombie shopping malls across the heartland. On the horizon is the disruption of sectors like energy, hotels, and transportation. Manufacturing is not far behind. </P><P>It’s no wonder that most leaders are struggling merely to come to grips with the implications of digitalization, let alone forming a clear strategy about how to deal with it. But if we can rise above the fog of digital war, a larger horizon can be seen. From our elevated view we can ask larger questions about what businesses and society want from digitalization. Questions like: “Can we pursue digitalization with a higher purpose in mind?” and “Can we steer digitalization to be a force for good, a force to transform economies so that they foster greater equity, environmental integrity, and shared global prosperity?”</P><P>Right now, two principal forces are driving digitalization. One is digital technology itself and its associated services and gadgets. Another is the invisible hand of the market responding to the evolving wants of consumers. </P><P>While these have historically been two powerful forces for progress, there are inherent limitations in their ability to steer society. First, laissez-faire markets have inequality built into them. This is because they respond preferentially to the wants of those with fat wallets. The needs of the world’s poor are poorly translated into market signals. Markets are also imperfect in that they fail to take into account externalities like environmental <mark>pollution</mark>, which degrades the planet. These limitations, if not attended to, almost guarantee that digitalization will not become the force for societal good that it has the potential to be.</P><H3>Purposeful Digital Transformation</H3><P>The world’s leaders — commercial, nonprofit, and governmental — need to pursue digitalization on purpose, purposefully leading the world toward a <A href=""https://sloanreview.mit.edu/tag/digital-leadership/""> better digital future</A>. Doing so requires a bigger perspective and greater responsibility for decisions made around digital technologies. It requires proactively scanning the emerging landscape for both social and environmental risks while simultaneously looking for opportunities to use digital technologies to resolve global challenges. This is digital transformation on purpose.</P><P>Grounded decision-making depends on having a framework for understanding the consequences of choices, so it would be helpful to have a framework for understanding how digitalization proceeds. We offer one below that defines the terms <EM>digitization, digitalization</EM>, and <EM>digital transformation</EM>. There is no consensus on the meaning of these terms and their definition often depends on who is using them: <A href=""https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/dont-confuse-digital-with-digitization/"">technologists</A>, <A href=""https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/digital-transformation-is-a-misnomer/"">consultants</A>, <A href=""https://www.i-scoop.eu/digitization-digitalization-digital-transformation-disruption/"">etc</A>. Our goal in defining the terms here is to create a framework that can help managers and policy makers think about using digital technology for the purpose of tackling the world’s sustainability problems. The definitions are presented in “A Framework for Understanding Digitalization.”</P><DIV class=""callout-highlight""><ASIDE class=""l-content-wrap""><ARTICLE><H4>A Framework for Understanding Digitalization</H4></ARTICLE></ASIDE></DIV><P>At a basic level is <EM>digitization</EM>, which is the initial conversion of products and services into a digital format, along with the concomitant inventions that result from digitization. This has happened first with sectors like publishing, music, and finance, mostly because their products were really just information to begin with — it’s just that the information had historically been captured in a physical analog format like vinyl records and accounting ledgers. </P><P>While digitization of this type of information is relatively easy, it has been slower with more tangible, physical products. New technologies, however, are changing this. Manufacturing will be upended by imaging technology that can scan 3-D objects and turn them into data files that can be freely shared over the internet. Improving sensor technology will allow for the capture of digital data about objects in real time, forcing continuous evolution of the <A href=""http://www.infosys.digital/do-more/tech-trends/trillion-sensor"">internet of things</A>. Combine these technologies with 3-D printers that can locally render the digital files into desired objects and you open the floodgates for the disruption of nearly every manufacturing sector. </P><P>The next phase is the <EM>digitalization</EM> of industries in which innovators and entrepreneurs develop new business models and business processes that can take advantage of the newly digitized products. It was the process of digitalization that allowed Steve Jobs to become the world’s largest music retailer. Apple didn’t invent the digitization of the music industry, but it did invent the digital business model that upended it. </P><P>Digitalization is usually disruptive for incumbents because it renders their existing business models and processes obsolete. The proud legacy assets of market giants quickly go from a source of competitive advantage to the proverbial albatross around the neck. This is why executives’ hair is graying as digitalization progresses across industries.</P><DIV class=""email-signup-form""><FORM><H1><P>Research Updates from </P></H1><P class=""email-signup-text"">Get semi-monthly updates on how global companies are managing in a changing world.</P><BUTTON type=""button"" name=""submit"">Sign up</BUTTON><P class=""email-signup-error"">Please enter a valid email address</P><P class=""email-signup-success"">Thank you for signing up</P><P class=""email-signup-link""><A href=""/privacy-policy/"">Privacy Policy</A></P></FORM></DIV><P>Digitalization will not be limited to the commercial sector, however. It is also coming to the public sector and will alter the role of governments and how they engage with their constituencies. Digital technologies do not, in general, recognize political boundaries but instead connect citizens of many countries into a single network. The question of who is a constituent in this environment will change. For example, citizens in many countries are affected by the election of a U.S. president, but only Americans (in theory, if not always in practice) have a say in the choice.  Similarly, Amazon’s decisions about where to <A href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/09/29/what-would-boston-look-like-amazon-job-came-here/eIlKY4quXqaZ0XcbqOeMbJ/story.html"">locate facilities</A> can have a huge impact on a locality’s economic development, but only senior executives have a say in deciding. </P><P>Questions of global inclusion, equity, prosperity, and environmental integrity will likely shift us <A href=""https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-accords-rely-on-the-power-of-markets"">away from traditional thinking about “government” to a broader understanding of “governance” </A>that will blur the roles of local communities, governments, and corporations.</P><P>The final phase in this framework is <EM>digital transformation</EM>, which occurs when new digital business models and processes restructure economies. Societies also evolve as people integrate the technologies into their lives and habits. <A href=""https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/achieving-digital-maturity/"">Digital transformation </A> is a systems-level transition that alters behaviors on a large scale. </P><P>Consider mating behavior. The telephone and the automobile, for example, revolutionized dating, taking young couples out from under the watchful eye of their parents at the church picnic to far more private parking lots and “cruising” spots across suburbia. Smartphone apps have more recently upended dating, replacing flowers and chocolates with Tinder swiping and hookups, even <A href=""https://realbotix.systems/"">obviating the need for another human</A> for sex. Digital technologies are poised to continue transforming everything from <A href=""https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/04/google-pixel-buds-translation-change-the-world/"">communication</A> to <A href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/human-capital/us-cons-digital-workplace-and-culture.pdf"">work</A> — even the <A href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609203/crispr-20-is-here-and-its-way-more-precise"">human genome</A>.</P><P>Of course, technology-facilitated transformations restructure society in both positive and negative ways. And humanity has usually adapted in a reactive — not proactive — way to these changes. This is often because technologies can proliferate much faster than our ability to understand their impacts. The automobile had been ubiquitous for decades before we understood the downsides of “car culture,” like smog, sprawl, and <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>Undoubtedly, there are unforeseen and unintended consequences looming from digital transformation. The stakes for getting this right, or wrong, are huge. <A href=""https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/video-the-impact-of-machine-learning-on-work-is-bigger-than-you-think/"">Technological unemployment</A> risks deepening inequality, but also offers new opportunities for leisure and artistic expression. Bioengineering advances offer hope for a healthier future, but also risks eugenics. Broad-based digital infrastructure connects the world, but also introduces new systemic <A href=""https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/safeguard-your-organizations-iot-initiatives/"">threats and vulnerabilities</A>. Digitalization on purpose demands that we not let the transformation of society be driven solely through the animal spirits of imperfect market forces, but also through the visible hand of society’s better angels.</P><H3>Being Purposeful About Transformation</H3><P>Each step in the above process offers opportunities to ask how digital technology can be used to tackle the world’s sustainability challenges. In fact, there are examples of this already happening. </P><P>Silicon Valley’s Tesla Inc., for example, was explicitly founded to “accelerate the advent of <mark>sustainable</mark> transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible.” An integral part of <A href=""https://www.tesla.com/blog/mission-tesla"">this mission</A> is the use of digital technology to transform transportation by connecting Tesla automobiles into shared fleets of self-driving vehicles operating on a distributed, renewable energy grid. <A href=""https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/mastercard-pins-down-the-cash-economy/"">Mastercard Inc.</A> is similarly using its digital network to help governments like South Africa tackle corruption and foster financial inclusion by converting social benefit programs from cash to safer digital payments. <A href=""https://www.cleanweb.co/about/"">The Cleanweb Initiative </A> is an organization of businesses, developers, and investors working to ensure information technologies become “a tool to improve global sustainability, economic prosperity, and human well-being.” </P><P>Opportunities like these will abound as the digital future unfolds. Our subsequent articles will follow the ensuing social transformation to provide real-time insight into how leaders can ensure their inevitable decisions serve our common digital future.</P><ASIDE class=""article-ad ad-300 ad-loop ad-300x250""><H6>advertisement</H6></ASIDE><DIV id=""article-authors"" class=""l-ref-block article-authors--inside ""><ASIDE><H5>About the Authors</H5><P>Gregory Unruh is the Arison Group Endowed Professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, and the <CITE>MIT Sloan Management Review</CITE>’s guest editor for the Sustainability Big Ideas Initiative.

Not as hard as many might think. </P></DIV><ASIDE class=""article-ad ad-300 ad-loop ad-300x250""><H6>advertisement</H6></ASIDE><P>Investors and the rest of the world are watching to see how companies will respond to the final recommendations of the <A href=""https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/"">Task Force on <mark>Climate</mark>-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)</A> commissioned by Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England and chair of the G20’s Financial Stability Board. Simply put, the TCFD is asking companies to report on their response to the risks and opportunities created by <mark>climate change</mark>. The TCFD emphasizes that these disclosures can be done in existing reporting formats (such as 10-Ks). </P><H3>The Motivation for Implementing the TCFD Recommendations</H3><P>Despite the voluntary nature of the TCFD recommendations, companies have several reasons to start implementing them. First is investor pressure: Investors need this information and are mobilizing to ensure companies take the recommendations seriously. For example, ShareAction, a U.K.-based NGO, and Boston Common Asset Management LLC have <A href=""https://shareaction.org/in-the-news/boston-common-and-shareaction-working-on-transatlantic-bank-engagement-on-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">organized a campaign</A> (representing $1 trillion in assets under management) to implement these recommendations at 60 of the world’s largest banks. It is likely that many more shareholders will be clamoring for a response at upcoming 2018 annual general meetings. </P><P>Second, investors may be less inclined to invest in companies that do not implement the recommendations. </P><P>Third is self-interest: Companies that comply with the recommendations will have better strategies for adapting to <mark>climate change</mark> and will be better able to explain these to the investment community. </P><P>Fourth, the recommendations will likely lead to regulation; laggards will find themselves playing catch-up, perhaps under time pressure and great expense if they’ve done nothing to lay the groundwork for following the TCFD’s recommendations. The stakes are high for investors, companies, and the world.</P><H3>The Practicality of Implementing TCFD Recommendations</H3><P>How hard will it be for companies to implement the TCFD’s recommendations? Consider an industry that is among the most severely challenged by <mark>climate change</mark>: oil and gas. We examined the disclosures from 2016 of 15 the largest oil and gas companies by market cap listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE): Anadarko, BP, Chevron, CNOOC, ConocoPhillips, Eni, EOG Resources, ExxonMobil, Occidental, Petrobras, <mark>PetroChina</mark>, Shell, Sinopec, Statoil, and Total. We reviewed each company’s 2016 SEC Form 10-K (used by U.S. domiciled listed companies) or Form 20-F (used by companies based outside the United States that have listed equity shares on U.S. exchanges) and their sustainability reports. </P><P>This makes for a good test. How much more disclosure is being recommended by the TCFD than already exists today? The short answer is that while there is work to be done, oil and gas companies won’t be starting with a blank sheet of paper. There are even a few that have already made good progress in adhering to the TCFD’s recommendations. While we don’t want to underemphasize some of the challenges, identified below, we also want to make it clear that the TCFD is not making recommendations that would be impossible to meet.</P><P>The TCFD report has four broad recommendations with the suggestion that companies provide these disclosures in their annual financial filings:</P><UL><LI><STRONG>Governance.</STRONG> Disclose the organization’s governance around <mark>climate</mark>-related risks and opportunities.</LI><LI><STRONG>Strategy.</STRONG> Disclose the actual and potential impacts of <mark>climate</mark>-related risks and opportunities on the organization’s businesses, strategy, and financial planning where such information is material.</LI><LI><STRONG>Risk Management.</STRONG> Disclose how the organization identifies, assesses, and manages <mark>climate</mark>-related risks. </LI><LI><STRONG>Metrics and Targets.</STRONG> Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant <mark>climate</mark>-related risks and opportunities where such information is material.</LI></UL><P>We explored three questions in our analysis:</P><OL type=""1""><LI>To what extent were oil and gas companies already following the TCFD recommendations using existing guidance from the <A href=""https://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2010/33-9106.pdf"">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</A>, <A href=""https://www.globalreporting.org/standards/"">Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and </A><A href=""https://www.sasb.org/"">Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)</A>?</LI><LI>If most (all) companies show a large gap in complying with the TCFD recommendations, would closing this gap result in increased legal liabilities from disclosure? </LI><LI>What needs to be done to facilitate adoption of the TCFD recommendations?</LI></OL><P>Three companies stood out. Eni, ExxonMobil, and Statoil provided the most robust disclosures. The disclosures made by the other companies were more limited and, in some cases, perfunctory. Eni, to some degree, addressed each of the four high-level disclosure recommendations. While it was the only company to do so, this shows that meeting the TCFD’s recommendations can be done. The disclosures of these three companies taken together provide a good starting road map for all oil and gas companies. </P><P>Strategy disclosures in both SEC filings and sustainability reports were generally well done. With a few exceptions, companies provided information that indicated a focus on their long-term strategy even where <mark>climate</mark> risk was not specifically mentioned. Discussion of forecasts for energy usage 20 or 30 years into the future often accompanied detailed information related to development of biofuels, <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage, natural gas fields, and investments in wind, solar, and fuel cells. However, few companies disclosed information about scenario analysis, including a “2-degree or lower” scenario — one in which companies are mandated to work toward maintaining the rise in global temperature to no more than 2ºC above pre-industrial temperatures.</P><P>Disclosures were weaker for Governance, Risk Management, and Metrics and Targets. The deficiencies were related to the 11 specific disclosure recommendations: failure to describe board oversight and management’s role in assessing <mark>climate</mark> risks; processes to manage and mitigate <mark>climate</mark>-related risks; and metrics to assess <mark>climate</mark> risks. For example, companies described board composition and expertise, but only one provided details about board committee meetings to address <mark>climate</mark> risk. Companies discussed <mark>climate</mark>-related risks in the “Risk Factors” section of their SEC filing, but these disclosures lacked detail. With respect to Metrics and Targets, many of the companies disclosed their greenhouse gas emissions in terms of performance and future goals, but very few discussed how the targets related to business model and strategy.</P><P>Both Eni and Statoil disclosed the sustainability targets for CEO incentive compensation. Eni also disclosed that its Sustainability and Scenarios Committee discussed energy scenarios and renewable energies at six of its 10 meetings. Statoil described a board and executive <mark>climate</mark> risk assessment process, though not at the recommended level of detail. Eni, Statoil, and Exxon provided performance information and targets for greenhouse gas emissions, <mark>carbon</mark> intensity, and efforts to reduce flaring and methane emissions. </P><P>This analysis provides evidence that the TCFD objectives can be met within existing financial filings. </P><DIV class=""email-signup-form""><FORM><H1><P>Research Updates from </P></H1><P class=""email-signup-text"">Get semi-monthly updates on how global companies are managing in a changing world.</P><BUTTON type=""button"" name=""submit"">Sign up</BUTTON><P class=""email-signup-error"">Please enter a valid email address</P><P class=""email-signup-success"">Thank you for signing up</P><P class=""email-signup-link""><A href=""/privacy-policy/"">Privacy Policy</A></P></FORM></DIV><H3>The Legality of Implementing TCFD Recommendations</H3><P>In general, we found more information relevant to the TCFD’s recommendations in voluntary sustainability reports than in official financial filings. Thus, companies are already disclosing information they are not required to. Why don’t more companies report <mark>climate</mark> risk information in their official filings? One possible reason, litigation risk, is a red herring. As <A href=""https://www.environmental-finance.com/content/news/dont-use-legal-risk-as-an-excuse-not-to-report-under-tcfd-says-picot.html"">explained by Russell Picot</A>, a special adviser to the TCFD, “…companies and lawyers have expressed concerns that scenario analysis could be interpreted as a forecast, and if proved inaccurate could lead to being sued by investors.” Picot explained that the TCFD is not asking for a “financial forecast,” only for companies to explain how their businesses might be affected under different scenarios. </P><P>Two companies in our study appear to share Picot’s views on scenario analysis and legal risk. Eni described how the company assessed recoverability of the carrying value of assets using the <A href=""https://www.iea.org/publications/scenariosandprojections/"">International Energy Agency (IEA) 450 Scenario</A> (a 2-degree scenario) in the Risk Factors section of its Form 20-F. Statoil’s Form 20-F described the sensitivity analysis of the company’s project portfolio using the IEA 450 Scenario, but not in great detail. </P><P>Similarly, in the Management Discussion and Analysis section of ExxonMobil’s Form 10-K, the company disclosed information about their processes to evaluate impairment of assets or project viability under a wide range of fact patterns, including changes in business <mark>climate</mark>, laws, and regulations. Even though ExxonMobil did not specifically address 2-degree scenarios, the fact that both Eni and ExxonMobil disclosed information about circumstances that might affect the value of assets and viability of projects in their SEC filings suggests that scenario analysis of asset impairment due to <mark>climate change</mark> is a first step that companies can take toward embedding the TCFD recommendations into financial filings.</P><P>General counsels at many companies may be tempted to reject Picot’s point of view and advise their companies to follow the recommendations of the TCFD in their voluntary — and largely unaudited — sustainability report. Our view is that the TCFD’s recommendations will have their full impact when the bulk of the information is included in an official financial filing. Information here gets greater scrutiny, is subject to better internal controls and procedures, in reality poses no legal risk, and is more credible to investors. </P><H3>Advice on Implementing TCFD Recommendations</H3><P>Below is a simple, three-step process for oil and gas companies, and companies in general, to meet the spirit of the TCFD’s recommendations.</P><P>First, the board of directors should direct executive management to adopt the recommendations of the TCFD. This can be done as part of a “<A href=""https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-board-that-embraced-stakeholders-beyond-shareholders/"">Statement of Significant Audiences and Materiality</A>.” The board should evaluate and take a position on <mark>climate</mark> risk by stating whether society as a whole is a significant audience and how it will evaluate the company’s short-, medium-, and long-term efforts to mitigate risks and leverage opportunities.</P><P>Second, executive management should develop a plan for how it can meet the TCFD’s recommendations, starting with the four categories and then drilling down to the more specific recommendations in each one. In doing so, they can learn from what has been done by Eni, ExxonMobil, Statoil, and eventually others. Recognizing the liability concerns, in the early stages the focus should be on what goes into the sustainability report.</P><P>Third, executive management should develop a plan for how it can shift the emphasis of its TCFD-related reporting from the sustainability report to its official and mandated financial filing. This will improve the quality of the information, as well as making clear how these disclosures are related to present and future financial performance. </P><P>Do companies have to do this? Not yet and not now. Will regulators require it? Probably not soon in most jurisdictions. But will investors be putting pressure on companies to do so? Yes, they will and they already are. This pressure will only increase as evidence mounts that how a company deals with <mark>climate change</mark> will determine its ability to deliver value for its investors — and the world at large.</P><P><EM>An adapted version of this article appears in the Spring 2018 print edition.</EM></P><ASIDE class=""article-ad ad-300 ad-loop ad-300x250""><H6>advertisement</H6></ASIDE><DIV id=""article-authors"" class=""l-ref-block article-authors--inside ""><ASIDE><H5>About the Authors</H5><P><A href=""https://twitter.com/rgeccles"">Bob Eccles</A> is a visiting professor of management practice at the Saïd Business School at Oxford University and board member of the Mistra Center for <mark>Sustainable</mark> Markets and the Stockholm School of Economics.

Organizations of all types are launching green campaigns—from the city of London’s Congestion Charge on automobiles, to <A href=""http://walmartstores.com/Sustainability/7986.aspx"" title=""Wal-Mart Stores Inc."">Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</A>’s push to sell organic <A href=""http://www.ssireview.org/topics/category/food"">foods</A>, to the University of Texas’s construction of <A href=""http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CategoryID=19"" title=""LEED green buildings"">LEED green buildings</A>. Consumers too are getting behind the idea of being greener. In almost every opinion poll, consumers say that they are very concerned about <mark>climate change</mark>. They worry about rising seas, declining air quality, shrinking animal habitats, lengthening droughts, and newly brewing diseases. And they connect the dots back to their own purchases, finds a 2007 McKinsey &amp; Company global survey of 7,751 consumers in eight major economies.<SUP>1</SUP>Our results show that a full 87 percent of these consumers are concerned about the <A href=""http://www.ssireview.org/topics/category/environment"">environmental </A>and social impacts of the products they buy.</P><P>But when it comes to actually buying green goods, words and deeds often part ways. Only 33 percent of consumers in our survey say they are ready to buy green products or have already done so. And, according to a 2007 <I>Chain Store Age</I> survey of 822 U.S. consumers, only 25 percent say they have bought a green product other than organic food or <A href=""http://www.ssireview.org/topics/category/energy"">energy </A>efficient lighting. By and large, consumers tend to ignore other Earth-friendly products such as carpets made from recycled fiber and energy-saving computers.</P><P>Even the green goods that have caught on have tiny market shares. Organic foods—which consumers buy more for their own health than for the environment’s—accounted for less than 3 percent of all food sales in 2006, according to the <I>Nutrition Business Journal</I>. In 2006, green laundry detergents and household cleaners made up less than 2 percent of sales in their categories. And despite their trendiness, <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_cars"" title=""hybrid cars"">hybrid cars</A> made up little more than 2 percent of the U.S. auto market in 2007, according to a report by J.D. Power and Associates.</P><P>As a result, consumers in the United States and other developed countries have done little to lighten their <mark>carbon</mark> footprints. Some of this lag between talking and walking could reflect consumers’ insincerity, laziness, posturing, or other unsavory traits. But much more of it is because businesses have not educated consumers about the benefits of green products and have failed to create green products that meet consumers’ needs.</P><P>Consumers want to act green, but they expect businesses to lead the way. According to our global survey, 61 percent of consumers say that corporations should take the lead in tackling the issue of <mark>climate change</mark>. To do this, businesses need to develop more and better Earth-friendly products. Some already are, but they are not doing a good job of marketing them, finds a <mark>Climate</mark> Group study, which discovered that two-thirds of American and British consumers cannot name a green brand. Similarly, the 2007 National Technology Readiness Survey of 1,025 U.S. adults found that more than two thirds of participants say they prefer to do business with environmentally <A href=""http://www.ssireview.org/topics/category/socially_responsible_business"">responsible companies</A>, but almost half say it is difficult to find green goods and services.</P><P>Corporations can reap multiple benefits by going green. They can reduce their energy consumption, lessen their risks, meet competitive threats, enhance their brands, and increase their revenues. Consider the success of <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_fluorescent_lamp"" title=""compact fluorescent lightbulbs"">compact fluorescent lightbulbs</A> (CFLs), for example. In 2005, sales of CFLs accounted for less than 5 percent of the total lightbulb market. But only two years later, in 2007—the year that the public woke up to the looming threat of <mark>climate change</mark>—CFLs captured an estimated 20 percent of the lightbulb market, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Companies that sell CFLs, like General Electric Co. (GE), have increased their revenues, enhanced their brands, and strengthened their competitive positions in the market.</P><P>To realize the true potential of the green market, businesses must help consumers change their behaviors. And that requires removing the hurdles between would-be green consumers’ intentions and actions. Based on McKinsey’s work with businesses and other organizations around the world, we have identified five of these hurdles. We also recommend five steps that businesses and other organizations should take to dismantle all of the barriers that prevent consumers from buying green.</P><P><B>WHY ECO’S A NO-GO</B></P><P>Our 2007 study of 7,751 consumers around the world identifies barriers to buying green at every stage of the purchase. First, consumers have to be aware that a product exists before they buy it. Yet many don’t even know about the green alternatives in many product categories. Next, consumers must believe that a product will get the job done. But many believe that green products are of lower quality than their more traditional “browner” counterparts. Consumers must then decide whether a product lives up to its green reputation. Yet many are skeptical about environmental claims, partly because they distrust corporations and the media. Finally, consumers must decide whether a product is worth the cost and effort needed to purchase it. But consumers often believe that the prices of green goods are too high, and have a hard time finding them anyway.</P><P>To increase the sales of environmentally sensible products, companies must remove these five barriers—namely, lack of awareness, negative perceptions, distrust, high prices, and low availability. In other words, they must increase consumers’ awareness of green products, improve consumers’ perceptions of eco-products’ quality, strengthen consumers’ trust, lower the prices of green products, and increase these products’ availability.</P><P>The importance of each barrier varies by product, industry, and geography. For instance, more than 90 percent of consumers who participated in the McKinsey global survey know about CFLs, so lack of awareness is not a barrier to their purchasing them. But many customers think CFLs are too expensive and of dubious quality. In other words, high price and negative perceptions impede these consumers’ progress toward a greener purchase. In contrast, only half of the participants in this study know about <mark>carbon</mark> credits, which are a way that an individual or business can lower its <mark>carbon</mark> footprint. Companies that sell these credits invest the money in renewable energy, reforestation, and other activities that reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, offsetting the emissions of the individual or business that purchased the <mark>carbon</mark> credit.</P><P>Across regions, moreover, consumers have different concerns about price and quality within the same product category. In the retail sector, for example, 14 percent of U.S. consumers say they are willing to pay a premium for green products, compared to 26 percent in Brazil, according to the McKinsey global survey. In the petroleum sector, 7 percent of French consumers are willing to pay a premium, compared to 26 percent in India.</P><P>Although the barriers between green thoughts and acts vary by product, industry, and region, the need to remove all barriers does not. In other words, companies have to move customers through the entire purchasing process—from being aware of eco-friendly products, to considering their pros and cons, to paying for the products. Understanding these barriers is the first step to growing green consumers.</P><P><B>FIVE BARRIERS TO GREENING</B></P><P><B>Lack of Awareness</B> Our study and others (such as London-based Account Ability’s report “What Assures Consumers on <mark>Climate Change</mark>?”) show that consumers know about <mark>climate change</mark>, understand that reducing their own greenhouse gas emissions will help fight <mark>climate change</mark>, and want to join that effort. But these studies also show that consumers do not quite understand how to act on their greener impulses. More than one-third of consumers we surveyed say they would like to take action against <mark>climate change</mark> but do not know what to do.</P><P>For example, the top three ways for consumers to reduce their own emissions of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (a greenhouse gas) are to drive a more fuel-efficient car, improve their home’s insulation, and reduce their consumption of beef. Yet the consumers in our study thought that using energy-efficient appliances and recycling were among the top three emission-cutting acts. (They correctly identified driving a more efficient car as one of the top three.) And although eating less beef is among the top three best acts of greenness, the fewest consumers knew how eco-friendly this behavior is.</P><P>Consumers are equally confused about buying green products—and with good reason. Many attempts to label green products are meaningless at best and bewildering at worst. For example, a current labeling program indicates how much <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide an item’s production, packaging, and shipment emitted—that is, its “<A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/<mark>Carbon</mark>_footprint"" title=""<mark>carbon</mark> footprint""><mark>carbon</mark> footprint</A>.” But calculating <mark>carbon</mark> footprints requires some very fancy math and results in numbers that few people intuitively understand. “What does it mean to say a bag of chips contains 75 grams of <mark>carbon</mark>?” asked Steve Howard, CEO of the <mark>Climate</mark> Group, in a March 6, 2008, <I>BusinessWeek</I> article. “I have a PhD in environmental physics and it does not mean a thing to me.”</P><P><B>Negative Perceptions</B> Even when consumers can correctly identify environmentally sound products, the green label sometimes proves to be the kiss of death. Some green products—such as <mark>Toyota Motor Corp.</mark>’s <A href=""http://www.toyota.com/prius-hybrid/"" title=""Prius automobile"">Prius automobile</A>—have become status symbols, but many environmentally friendly products suffer an image problem. According to the 2007 GfK Roper Green Gauge study of more than 2,000 Americans, fully 61 percent believe that green goods perform worse than conventional items. Indeed, early green products often trailed behind their conventional competition. Early hybrid cars, for example, had less power than non-hybrid cars. CFL light bulbs also had to overcome problems: Early versions were slow to light up, had weak light when they did illuminate, and didn’t fit properly into most normal light fixtures.</P><P><B>Distrust</B> Consumers doubt not only the quality of green products, but also their very greenness, according to the GfK Roper survey. Although they trust the environmental claims of scientists and environmental groups, they tend not to believe the claims of government, media, and business—and justifiably. A 2007 study by TerraChoice Environmental Marketing Inc. (<A href=""http://www.terrachoice.com/files/6_sins.pdf"" title=""“The Six Sins of Greenwashing”"">“The Six Sins of Greenwashing”</A>) examined 1,753 environmental product claims and found that all but one were misleading or just plain false. In the misleading category: Some companies tout product features that are actually mandated by law. For example, TerraChoice found insecticides, lubricants, oven cleaner gels, cleaners, and disinfectants all labeled as CFC-free. But no products sold today in the United States have CFCs, because the federal government banned the ozone-eating propellants almost three decades ago. Other companies mislead consumers by highlighting one positive product feature while not mentioning their other negative qualities. For instance, paper or lumber products tout their recycled content or <mark>sustainable</mark> harvesting without noting the impact of their manufacturing processes on air and water emissions or global warming. And in the just plain false category: A dishwasher detergent boasted on its 100 percent plastic container that it used 100 percent recycled paper.</P><P><B>High Prices</B> Consumers who get past the sometimes checkered history of eco-friendly products often encounter a fourth barrier: their frequently higher prices. Indeed, price is the largest barrier to buying green products, found the U.K. Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs in its 2007 survey of 3,600 U.K. consumers. Close to half of this survey’s participants want a two-year return on the premium price they pay for a product. Yet 70 percent of green appliances, including energy-efficient televisions, washers, and dryers, take longer to recoup their purchasers’ money. Solar power is another example where, according to our analysis of data from the California Energy Commission, a combination of recent technological advances, government subsidies, and good weather have helped reduce the payback period to less than 10 years in California, making residential photovoltaic usage a practical reality for some consumers but still an expensive luxury for others. Because consumers perceive the benefits of green goods to be small and long term, they often view the often higher costs of these products to be too high.</P><P><B>Low Availability</B> Having decided to buy Earth-friendly items, many consumers encounter a final hurdle: They can’t find them. Biofuel enthusiasts, for example, must often drive out of their way to fill up on their chosen fuel. Many energy-conscious homeowners have no other choice than to buy dirty power because their local utilities simply do not offer clean energy. And many contractors do not know where to purchase green building materials. The reason consumers cannot find these products is that businesses are not stocking them. In 2007, we did an informal survey of 23 grocery retailers in Chicago and the San Francisco Bay Area. We found that fewer than half offered green products besides organic food and CFLs. Among the minority that did proffer eco-friendly nonfood items, only about 10 percent stocked more than one product.</P><P><B>BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS</B></P><P>Knowing what stops consumers from buying green products is only half the battle. The other half is knowing how to break down these barriers. Below are five steps for removing the hurdles between green thoughts and green acts. Companies first need to figure out which customers are likely to want which products. They must then examine how people in these different market segments make their purchasing decisions. No matter which barriers prove most important for a given market segment or product, however, businesses must address barriers in all areas before consumers will change their behaviors.</P><P><B>Educate Consumers</B> Because consumers are largely unaware of green alternatives, businesses first need to think of themselves as educators, not salespeople. And they must expand their lesson plans beyond their own products to the larger issues of <mark>pollution</mark>, <mark>climate change</mark>, overfishing, and other environmental problems. And nonprofits and government agencies also need to take up the cause of green education.</P><P>Consider the success of <A href=""http://www.energystar.gov/"" title=""Energy Star"">Energy Star</A>. This program, a joint effort launched by the EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy in 1992, educates consumers about how energy-efficient products can reduce energy use, save money, and protect the environment. Every product that meets government energy-efficiency standards can carry the Energy Star label, which has gained widespread consumer recognition and trust. Because federal regulations mandated energy labels on certain appliances, almost half of the air conditioners sold in the United States in 2005 carried the Energy Star label. In addition, in 2005, close to 30 percent of all U.S. homes had energy-efficient refrigerators and washing machines, according to the Vermont Department of Public Service.</P><P>To cite another example: Procter &amp; Gamble Co.’s (P&amp;G) “<A href=""http://www.packagingnews.co.uk/news/737170/Procter---Gamble-unveils-<mark>sustainable</mark>-living-label/"" title=""Future Friendly"">Future Friendly</A>” campaign teaches consumers how they can have a positive impact on the environment by making their homes more energy efficient, using less water, and reducing the amount of household waste. Specific tips include washing clothes in cold water and drying them in the air rather than in a dryer. P&amp;G benefits because it refreshes its brand, enhances its reputation, and protects its market share from new environmentally friendly competitors.</P><P><B>Build Better Products</B> For consumers to improve their opinions of green products, companies must create ones that are equal to, or better than, conventional alternatives. Consumers still value performance, reliability, and durability much more than a product’s ecological soundness. Indeed, to overcome their image problem, green products must often outperform their traditional counterparts.</P><P>GE managed to do this with the CFLs. The first CFLs cost a lot more, and were harder to find than conventional bulbs. Now, they pay for themselves in five months, and are readily available. Wal-Mart has committed to sell 100 million CFLs in 2008 and displays them prominently on its shelves. CFLs piggybacked on Energy Star’s success with the “Change a Light, Change the World” campaign. This effort increased awareness of CFLs and resulted in 500,000 pledges to replace a traditional light bulb with an Energy Star CFL.</P><P>Toyota likewise had to tackle early perceptions that the Prius had less power than non-hybrid cars. Toyota did this by redesigning the Prius to meet performance and style preferences of consumers. The carmaker increased the horsepower and conducted a campaign promoting the vehicle as “quick, roomy, and economical.”</P><P><B>Be Honest</B> In recent years, consumers have caught companies red-handed at “greenwashing”—that is, claiming that their products are far more environmentally friendly than they actually are. To rebuild public trust, companies must inform the public about their true environmental impact, as well as about their attempts to reduce that impact. Many will need to identify and address specific historical concerns about their products or operations. Only then will consumers believe the company’s Earth-sparing claims.</P><P>In 2005, GE launched “<A href=""http://www.grist.org/news/muck/2005/05/10/little-ge/"" title=""Ecomagination"">Ecomagination</A>,” an initiative with the broad objective of meeting environmental challenges such as the need for clean water, renewable energy, and reduced emissions. Ecomagination covered GE’s efforts to enhance its investment in <mark>sustainable</mark> technologies and increase its revenues from <mark>sustainable</mark> products such as lower-emission aircraft engines, efficient lighting, wind turbines, and water purification technology. As part of the Ecomagination campaign, GE also undertook efforts to make its own operations more environmentally <mark>sustainable</mark>. One of the results of the program is that GE kept its greenhouse gas emissions flat in 2005, even as revenues rose.<SUP>2</SUP></P><P>Telling consumers they should act green when the company itself is making little effort to improve its own operations is asking for a backlash. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), a U.K. watchdog, received a fourfold increase in complaints about environmental claims in advertisements in 2007.<SUP>3</SUP> One offender, according to ASA, was the low-price airline Ryanair Ltd., which promoted itself as the industry leader in environmental efficiency. In 2007, however, the airline received significant negative press when CEO Michael O’Leary confessed that his claim that the airline had cut emissions of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide by half over the past five years was an “error.”<SUP>4</SUP></P><P><B>Offer More</B> To increase sales of green products, companies must make sure that consumers understand the returns—both financial and environmental—on their investment. When consumers find it easy to track their savings from using a product, they are more willing to try new green products—especially those that cost more. They also feel more confident about their eco-friendly purchases when they understand how the products help the environment.</P><P>Many companies participate in Energy Star’s voluntary EnergyGuide labeling program. Labels placed on products in retail stores communicate the products’ annual energy use (in watts and dollars) and compares it to similar products. Presented in a simple and clear manner, the information helps consumers choose products that not only are energy efficient but also save them money. The Prius’s value goes well beyond functionality.</P><P>The Prius caught consumers’ imaginations because it had a unique and contemporary style that signaled the owners’ commitment to the environment. Its dashboard communicates fuel consumption and energy efficiency, thereby broadcasting the car’s environmental benefits. By contrast, Honda Motor Co.’s Accord hybrid, which looked more conventional and did not toot its own environmental horn, languished (and was eventually dropped in 2008). In 2006, Prius held 76 percent of the hybrid market; the Accord hybrid, which functioned just as well as the Prius, held just 12 percent.</P><P><B>Bring Products to the People</B> Companies cannot sell their products if consumers cannot find them. It sounds obvious, but many of today’s green products are not widely available. Even finding out how to get them is difficult.</P><P>Wal-Mart and GE have helped make CFLs a successful consumer product by making it easy for consumers to buy them. Wal-Mart put the bulbs in the most coveted place—at eye level on the top two or three shelves. An educational display from GE complements the attractive shelf placement. Toyota communicates its intent to make the Prius widely available by running ads that say: “We’ve significantly increased production on the hard-to-find, easy-to-drive Toyota Prius.” According to <I>AutoInsight</I>, Toyota has increased production of the Prius since 1999 by an average of 50 percent a year.</P><P><B>THE GREEN IMPERATIVE</B></P><P>Businesses alone cannot lead consumers from intention to action. In many instances, the government and the civil sector need to be heavily involved to achieve long-lasting changes in consumer behavior. Nevertheless, businesses should play a leading role in the green movement in order to shape their market opportunities and manage potential regulation of their industries.</P><P>Green products and services are only a niche market today, but they are poised for strong growth. Already, 33 percent of consumers say they are willing to pay a premium for green products, and another 54 percent care about the environment and want to help tackle <mark>climate change</mark>. Entering the green market can also improve companies’ reputations, thereby increasing the value of their brands. Some 70 percent to 80 percent of public companies’ valuation in American and Western European stock markets depends on expectations of the company’s cash flow beyond the next three years. Companies’ reputations strongly shape those expectations, and corporate citizenship is the top driver of reputation, according to the Reputation Institute’s 2007 global survey.</P><P>In addition, firms that have a strong position in the green market can stay ahead of regulation and protect their market share from competitors. More than 80 percent of 2,192 executives surveyed by <I>The McKinsey Quarterly</I> about <mark>climate change</mark> expect some form of <mark>climate change</mark> regulation within the next five years in countries where their companies operate.<SUP>5</SUP>European countries already have limits on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions through the 
<A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol"" title=""Kyoto Protocol"">Kyoto Protocol</A>, and a number of U.S. states have established similar systems. More than 600 mayors from around the world have committed their cities to comply with the Kyoto Protocol.</P><P>The most proactive companies will lead regulation, and may even push for stricter regulations that will put their less environmentally savvy competitors at a disadvantage. Newcomers, in turn, can steal market share from existing companies by appealing to the growing legions of green consumers. 
<A href=""http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/"" title=""Whole Foods Market Inc."">Whole Foods Market Inc.</A>, with its double-digit sales growth in the essentially flat supermarket industry, is a powerful example of a new entrant that is not only winning market share with a green and ethical offering, but also taking share in the premium segment of the market.</P><P>Companies may rightly ask whether cultivating green consumers is worth all the trouble. We believe that it is not only worth the trouble, but also imperative for success. Once businesses remove the obstacles between consumers’ desire to buy green and the actual follow-through of those sentiments, green products could experience explosive sales growth. What’s more, building a reputation as an Earth-friendly corporation can do much more than generate increased revenues from green products. The better a company’s reputation, the more talented the employees it can attract, the more loyalty it can inspire in its customers, and the more it can charge for its products.</P><P><I>This article has benefited from the thoughtful and ongoing insights of our fellow McKinsey &amp; Company colleagues, especially Nadeem Sheikh and Jessica Weisz.</I></P><P>Notes</P><OL><LI> The survey was conducted in Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Glencore optimistically asserted that the deal would close in the first half of 2018–which is already half over.  Given all of this uncertainty about CEFC, this looks incredibly unrealistic, but Glencore has not provided any more guidance. Go figure!</P><P>The price  CEFC agreed to was never disclosed in full, but was allegedly enough to allow Glencore (and the Russian banks backing it) and Intessa Saopaolo to emerge whole.   Glencore did let on that the price was at a 16 percent premium to the 30 day volume weighted average of the <mark>Rosneft</mark> price, presumably meaning the 30 day period (business days? Calendar days?) prior on 8 September, 2017.  In August-early September, 2017, <mark>Rosneft</mark> traded in the $5-$5.25 range, which puts the price in the $5.80-$6.00 ballpark.  That comports with a $9 billion total price for 14.16 percent of <mark>Rosneft</mark>’s 10,598,177,817 shares, which works out to about $6/share.  The price yesterday was $5.41, so it is clear that CEFC’s position is well under water.

These manufacturing systems have enabled impressive economic growth and raised the global standard of living. But as the land, water, and fossil fuel resources those systems rely on become more scarce, biology is offering new ways to engineer solutions.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Synthetic biology redesigns existing organisms for specific purposes to produce safe products that are more efficient, reliable, and predictable. Engineered microorganisms can make many of the same ingredients used in traditional industrialization processes with less energy and waste and without relying on petroleum derivatives. Synthetic biology’s breakthroughs will speed the development of biologically engineered solutions to global problems related to health, materials, energy, and environment. Its approach is multidisciplinary, bringing together biologists, engineers, software developers, chemists, and bioinformatics specialists to understand how genes work together and combine to produce useful applications. Synbio tools make the programming of biology more predictable, more like software.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">This article examines the exciting new tools being developed to solve issues I’ve spent my career tackling. It will give a historic perspective on the use of synbio to produce advanced biofuels and chemicals; look at new bio-based materials, platforms, and food; and examine what is catching investors’ interest now in industrial biotechnology and agriculture.</SPAN></P><H3>Synthetic Biology for Advanced Biofuels</H3><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">My experience with synbio (before it was called that) began at the start of the advanced biofuels industry around 2005. We were trying to get enzymes to cheaply break down cellulose and hemicellulose and to develop microorganisms to process C5 and C6 sugars for the development of advanced biofuels.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">By 2007 government exuberance was pushing technologies and companies too fast. The DOE backed the funding of </SPAN><A href=""http://www.bioenergywiki.net/DOE_Selects_Six_Cellulosic_Ethanol_Plants_for_Up_to_$385_Million_in_Federal_Funding""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">six commercial-scale projects for $385M</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> when the biology was barely off the lab bench and no one had drafted engineering plans. Venture capitalists got excited and put too much money into very early stage companies. This is what VCs do – but in this case they expected the companies to scale and commercialize as quickly as software.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">The companies scaled their technology too quickly, skipping important developmental steps. We realized that after investors put $200M into a company, the company then needed an additional $200M to build its first plant. Then, as if high capital costs and scale-up risk were not harmful enough, when the bottom fell out of the energy market during the recession, it took much of the nascent synbio biofuel industry with it. This was followed by new energy sources and tanking oil prices. Competing with $140/barrel oil was one thing, but $50 was impossible.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Then along came the blend wall and the stalling of the </SPAN><A href=""http://www2.epa.gov/renewable-fuel-standard-program""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Renewable Fuels Standard.</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> The problem here was not in biology – it was a systemic failure that no one saw coming soon enough. Many companies went bankrupt and investors closed their doors.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Today, advanced biofuels technology sits mostly with large, deep-pocketed companies. They have had some successes in building large advanced biofuels plants: Abengoa, DuPont, Poet, Beta Renewables, GranBio. Big, patient companies with other revenue streams can hold and improve the technology until such time as we have policies to support <mark>innovation</mark>. Energy markets are not free markets and don’t properly reward or support <mark>innovation</mark>. Advanced biofuel investors need policy made and maintained by a diverse set of governments. We hope to see such policy agreements come </SPAN><A href=""http://unfccc.int/meetings/paris_nov_2015/meeting/8926.php""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">out of Paris this week.</SPAN></A></P><H3>Pivot to Chemicals</H3><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Challenged by cheap oil, investor fatigue, and technical hurdles, many biofuel companies pivoted to produce alternative chemical products through fermentation. We looked for products with lower costs, lower volume, and higher value, that used biomass and bioprocesses to replace petroleum as the important building block in a number of end products including plastics, lubricants, waxes, and cosmetics.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bio-based platform chemicals are now being produced at small scale mostly above the cost of the petroleum-based products they are trying to replace. These chemicals will be at price parity when we get to large-scale production. During product development and certification, products must be tested and approved throughout the supply chain by chemical producers, product manufacturers, brand owners, retailers, and end consumers. Each stakeholder in the supply chain needs to believe the product shows equal to superior performance. Powerful end users like Coca-Cola with their 20% bio-based bottle are a huge help in pulling product through the chain. They are often willing to pay premium price at the start and can adapt their packaging lines. Each new application of a new or drop-in chemical requires testing and approval that takes time and can’t be rushed by impatient investors. </SPAN></P><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many companies like Amyris and Solazyme are developing ingredients that go into other products, such as flavors and fragrances. As in most biochemical production, the microorganism is removed after fermentation, and at a molecular level, the product is identical to the non-fermented product it is made to replace.</SPAN></P><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Three companies (Solazyme, Amyris, BioAmber) have gone public and are having to deal with being in the public markets.

We now have a transformative skill set that allows for quick design, not discovery of new products in a predictable fashion. Biology is becoming more software driven using cloud resources, robots, machine learning, and automation. Development can be done in silico. Costs for doing work continue to go down – for example, the costs and time requirement for gene editing are falling rapidly. Zinc-finger nucleases are costly and can take up to a cost about </SPAN><A href=""http://www.biocompare.com/Editorial-Articles/144186-Genome-Editing-with-CRISPRs-TALENs-and-ZFNs/""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">$3,000 per gene and take up to a year. </SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now, using CRISPR/Cas9, the cost is </SPAN><A href=""http://www.biocompare.com/Editorial-Articles/144186-Genome-Editing-with-CRISPRs-TALENs-and-ZFNs/""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">below $500 per gene</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> for a more accurate process that takes only a week. A genome can now be sequenced for well </SPAN><A href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-01-15/illuminas-new-low-cost-genome-machine-will-change-health-care-forever""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">under $10,000 and going lower.</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> These new technologies allow product companies to stay smaller longer without burning as much cash.</SPAN><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">These tools are opening up new company and product possibilities. Three areas of interest (outside of pharma) are platform technology companies, industrial biotech, and agriculture.</SPAN></P><H3>Platform technologies</H3><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">I got a front row seat to the early stages of a platform technology company as a pre-Series A board member of Zymergen. These fast-emerging companies are developing technology to support and enable product companies. In the previous generation of biofuel/biochemical companies, R&amp;D had to staff their own microbiologists, buy their own robots, and develop their own bioinformatics systems. They had to engineer and optimize their own microorganisms to make desired products.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now product companies can get superior microbes engineered to order. With more than $100M raised among them this year, Zymergen, Ginkgo Bioworks, Synthace, and Biosyntia are relying on a mix of robotic automation, machine learning, novel software, and high-throughput screening to rapidly develop and optimize new strains to produce industrial chemicals and other bio-based products.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Tool-based companies have caught the eye of investors this year: </SPAN></P><UL><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Zymergen – brings scale and efficiency to the process of strain optimization.

Raised $344M + $160M IPO ($35/share)</SPAN></LI></UL><H3>Industrial Biotechnology</H3><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many startups are focusing on smaller scale, higher value products that do not compete with petroleum or low-margin commodities. These products require less cap-ex and have lower feedstock exposure due to smaller volumes. New products are more likely to help incumbents, not try to replace them. Here are a few examples of these new companies, their products, and money raised to date:</SPAN></P><UL><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bolt Threads – high-performance fashion fibers.

Demand for animal protein is increasing in the developing world, devouring resources and creating waste. The total <mark>carbon</mark> footprint of beef is 4 pounds of greenhouse gases </SPAN><A href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/one-hamburger-environment-resources-2015-2""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">per quarter pound of meat,</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> including all the greenhouse gases released during its production.  Although taste and consumer acceptance are going to be challenges, animal protein substitutes are a great way to reduce the <mark>carbon</mark> footprint. Some companies are developing plant-based products, while others are fermentation-based:</SPAN></P><UL><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Beyond Meat – animal protein from plant protein.

Many startups are focused on the post-animal bio-economy. Groups are developing organisms to make different kinds of meat, egg and milk proteins, shark fin, and gelatin. These companies have a ways to go and their exits are far from certain. But the new products and technologies will have a positive impact on the environment.    </SPAN></P><H3>Agriculture</H3><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’ve worked for decades to commercialize advanced biotechnology tools for the development of genetically modified crops using </SPAN><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Agrobacterium</SPAN></I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> and similar methods. The new focus is on technologies considered non-transgenic in plants, biocontrol products, and plant nutrition to reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and toxic inputs, use less land and water, combat pests, and increase soil fertility.</SPAN></P><P><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Feedstock for 2</SPAN></I><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">nd</SPAN></I><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> gen fuels/chemicals and power</SPAN></I></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">As we continue to expand from hydro<mark>carbon</mark>-based products to carbohydrates, we will need better plant sugars using less water, less land, and fewer inputs. As soon as there is a market pull for $20/ton biomass, there will be companies to provide it, likely using new non-GMO tools to produce better crops faster.</SPAN></P><H3>Gene editing, breeding tools</H3><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">The big six ag companies – <mark>BASF</mark>, Bayer CropScience, Dupont, Dow Chemical Company, Monsanto, and Syngenta – have invested millions of dollars in internal R&amp;D for the commercialization of genetically modified crops. They are unlikely to invest equivalent resources in building new gene editing tools to produce improved non-GMO crops. A number of companies are developing platform technologies to make gene editing faster, quicker, and better. Large seed companies will likely license, partner, and acquire these companies. Two in the forefront are Caribou, with CRISPR technology (raised $14.46M), and Cibus, using gene-editing tools to produce herbicide-resistant crops with other traits and crops on the horizon. To date three US companies are selling crop products that were engineered using gene editing techniques: Cibus – herbicide-resistant canola; Okanagan Specialty Fruits (acquired by Intrexon) – Arctic apples that resist turning brown when sliced or bruised; J. R. Simplot Company – Innate potatoes that resist bruising and produce less potentially</SPAN><A href=""http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/cancer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">cancer</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">-causing chemical when fried.  Consumer acceptance of the apples and potatoes remains to be seen.</SPAN></P><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Regulation of gene editing techniques in crops is still ambiguous, causing some investors to be cautious. The European Commission is debating regulations of the latest techniques, and they may classify plants as GMOs even if they lack foreign DNA. In the United States, modifying plants with </SPAN><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Agrobacterium</SPAN></I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> requires regulation by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, but plants modified by gene editing (ZFN, TALEN, and CRISPR/Cas based methods) are not currently regulated. In July, the White House launched a multiyear initiative to review federal regulations on agricultural biotechnology so the rules could change. </SPAN></P><P style=""text-align: left;""><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Microbial Solutions: Inoculants, biocontrol, stimulants</SPAN></I></P><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the beginning of my career, I worked on commercialization of natural biocontrol products produced from sources such as the Neem tree and naturally occurring fungi. We just couldn’t make them financially viable. Now scientists can develop new products to improve crop health by discovering, developing, and altering what naturally occurs in the microbiome of plants and soils. Microbial products are made from microbes that work alone or complement traditional methods of plant production and protection. Products can protect crops from pests and disease, combat resistance, and enhance plant productivity and fertility. Inoculant and biocontrol products can be applied on broad acre crops such as corn and soy, and on fruits and vegetables to help plants take up nutrients and defend against pests, disease, and weeds. </SPAN><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Novozymes and Monsanto have formed the BioAg Alliance to catalyze the development of new microbial solutions to address this market. In November, Syngenta and DSM announced a </SPAN><A href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-06/syngenta-ties-with-dsm-in-race-for-bacteria-based-crop-products""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">collaboration </SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">that will focus on creating bio-controls, bio-pesticides, and bio-stimulants. A number of smaller companies are developing technologies as well:</SPAN></P><UL><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> AgBiome – researching plant-associated microbiome to discover new biological and trait genes. Raised $34.5M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Symbiota – improve plant health and growth by promoting a healthy microbiome. Raised $7.5M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Agrimetis – natural product-derived compounds to protect crops from weeds, fungal diseases, and insect pests. Raised $7.3M</SPAN></LI></UL><H3>Exits</H3><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">A number of IPOs and acquisitions occurred in the first group of biofuels and biochemical companies with varying degrees of shareholder benefit. I was at Codexis, the first of the group to go public, when we IPOed. Codexis and other early IPO companies have remade themselves a number of times and their value is mostly unrecognized in the public markets. Amyris, Solazyme, Codexis, Gevo, and Metabolix are all trading below $3 a share. REG and Bioamber are trading around $8. Without knowing the financial details, it is unlikely the acquisitions of LS9, OPX, Cobalt, and Verenium were major windfalls for investors. Investment and attitudes will shift for this sector as we develop a price scheme for <mark>carbon</mark> to drive the use of non-petroleum-based products and advanced biofuels.</SPAN><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">With all of the seed round and Series A money going into platform, ag, and early-stage biomaterials companies, there is a concern about valuations getting too high and successful routes to exit. Middle-stage capital is missing in this space; medium-size companies have trouble making it to revenues. Raising C or D rounds has been tough. As happens with new asset classes and sectors, most investment firms tracking the industry have yet to build a substantial track record and a route to exit. Private equity firms have played a relatively limited role in the agriculture technology and biomaterials space so far. One of the main reasons is that few of them have been focused on the sector due mostly to the early stage of the companies.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Two examples of acquisitions include Bayer’s $425M acquisition of AgraQuest, the biologicals company, in June 2012 from Otter Capital and Generation Investment Management. In November 2012, <mark>BASF</mark> acquired Becker Underwood, a biological seed treatment, from Norwest Equity Partners for $1.02B. A few IPOs have occurred in the ag space including Marrone Bio <mark>Innovation</mark>s, the biopesticide company, and Arcadia Biosciences, the agriculture traits producer. Marrone is currently trading 80% below its IPO price and Arcadia is 65% below IPO price. Both deals were downsized on low demand and priced below initial share price target range.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Strategic investors like the Big 6 in ag have played a role in building excitement around the sector and its exit potential. Investors outside the industry – giants like Microsoft and Google – could soon become participants and buyers in ag and biomaterials/products. They will make for interesting competitors for incumbents. </SPAN></P><H3>Going Forward</H3><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">We are in the golden age of biology. With the development of exciting new tools, we can engineer plants and microorganisms to make better, cheaper, and unique products. Many of the solutions I have worked on over my career were not financially viable at the time. We now are able to iterate faster and get to market and revenues more quickly with lower costs. It’s why I never say, “I’ve tried that, it didn’t work.” We just didn’t have the right tools yet. We may never get all segments of the population to say the words “<mark>climate change</mark>,” but society is looking for technologies that make us more resilient and adaptable. This change will help lead us to a price scheme on <mark>carbon</mark>, stimulating investment back into advanced biofuels and chemicals. We will adopt new bio-based materials that reduce the demand for protein sources like beef and eggs for a world with more people and fewer resources. Technologies that allow us to produce more food, fuel, and fiber with fewer inputs will make it to market and create shareholder, consumer, and environmental returns.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">In Paris this week the top global leaders announced the launch of “</SPAN><A href=""http://mission-<mark>innovation</mark>.net/""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mission <mark>Innovation</mark></SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">,” a 20-country initiative to accelerate public and private global clean energy <mark>innovation</mark> to address global <mark>climate change</mark>, provide affordable clean energy to consumers, and create additional commercial opportunities in clean energy.

Also to note is that today’s markets are not too pretty in terms of gains. Everything is in the red, including Stellar (XLM) that should be basking in the news that <mark>IBM</mark> will issue a token on its blockchain to help offset <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>The current market analysis puts XLM at the value of $0.323 and down 12.24% in 24 hours. The rest of the market is also in the red. Bitcoin (BTC) is at the low $8,000 levels and currently trading at $8,248. Ethereum (ETH) is down below $700 and currently trading at $690.

But his leaky language left plenty of space for promises to fall through. Tillerson said repeatedly that he would push for the U.S. to retain a “seat at the table.” Yet he noted President-elect Trump’s commitment to “America first,” and said that funding for international <mark>climate</mark> agreements would be reviewed from the “bottom-up.”</P><P>Asked by committee chair Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., to succinctly state his “personal position” on <mark>climate change</mark>, Tillerson replied, “The increase in the greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere are having an effect. Our ability to predict that effect is very limited.”</P><P>When Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., asked him to acknowledge the scientific finding that <mark>climate change</mark> <A href=""https://www.nap.edu/catalog/21852/attribution-of-extreme-weather-events-in-the-context-of-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">increases</A> the odds that certain types of extreme weather events will occur. Tillerson replied, “There’s some literature out there that suggests that; there’s other literature that says it’s inconclusive.”</P><P>Such obtuse answers are a hallmark of the contemporary denial movement and reveal a suspicious lack of enthusiasm about heeding what the most definitive studies say. Tillerson is right that we can’t predict exactly how deeply <mark>climate change</mark> will unravel us, but the range of possibilities laid out in innumerable studies warn against a wait-and-see attitude.</P><P>Despite Exxon Mobil’s <A href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tillerson-exxon-<mark>climate</mark>-donations_us_5873a3f4e4b043ad97e48f52?y87ukyqivbre2vs4i"">promise</A> under Tillerson to stop donating to some organizations that promote <mark>climate</mark> denial, the practice has continued. The company donated a <A href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tillerson-exxon-<mark>climate</mark>-donations_us_5873a3f4e4b043ad97e48f52?y87ukyqivbre2vs4i"">reported</A> $6.5 million to such groups from 2008 to 2015.</P><P>And while Tillerson in 2009 came out in <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/28/business/energy-environment/rex-tillerson-secretary-of-state-exxon.html"">support</A> of a <mark>carbon</mark> tax, a policy that could reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, he made that announcement at a moment when it conflicted with a major push for a bill that, had it passed, would have enshrined a totally different <mark>carbon</mark> reduction approach, called cap-and-trade.</P><P>The simple truth is that as Tillerson was shifting his corporation’s rhetoric away from <mark>climate</mark> doubt, he was also pushing forward a program of oil and gas extraction that, if it continues apace, would prevent nations from achieving the Paris agreement temperature goal.</P><P><U>The issue that</U> senators focused on the most by far on Wednesday was Tillerson’s close relationship with Russia and his efforts with Exxon to convince the U.S. to end sanctions against the country, which stalled oil and gas deals reportedly worth billions.</P><P>But lost in that story has been the nature of the project Exxon Mobil had planned. In September 2014, Exxon and the Russian state oil company <mark>Rosneft</mark> <A href=""http://barentsobserver.com/en/energy/2014/09/discovers-kara-sea-oil-week-sanctions-hit-29-09"">discovered</A> oil in the Russian Arctic Kara Sea only a week before U.S. sanctions went into effect against Russia for its annexation of Crimea.</P><P><A href=""http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en/current-issues/arctic/presence/our-arctic-presence"">According to Exxon</A>, the Kara Sea licenses occupy an area “equivalent to all the leases in the Gulf of Mexico combined.” Arctic oil extraction is a long-term project — getting to the point where the oil is making it to market can take decades of work and an incredible investment of resources that, to be worthwhile, requires high crude prices. Because of this, a <A href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v517/n7533/abs/nature14016.html"">study</A> published in Nature in 2015 stated that to achieve the 3.6 degrees emission scenario, no Arctic oil should be extracted. In fact, last May the oil company Total declared that it would not pursue Arctic exploration, <A href=""http://www.total.com/sites/default/files/atoms/files/integrating_<mark>climate</mark>_into_our_strategy_eng.pdf"">because</A> “the [3.6 degree] scenario highlights the fact that a part of the world’s fossil fuel resources cannot be developed.”</P><P>Meanwhile, Obama has banned drilling in large portions of the U.S. Arctic because of extreme conditions that make drilling difficult and cleaning up a spill even harder. Tillerson, for his part, <A href=""https://theintercept.com/2015/05/11/dear-oil-industry-energy-secretary-seeks-arctic-advice-petrol-profiteers/"">pushed</A> the U.S. government to embrace Arctic drilling. In 2015 he led an Arctic research group for the National Petroleum Council, an Energy Department advisory committee whose members mostly work for the industry, that published a report encouraging the Obama administration to expand Arctic opportunities in the U.S.</P><P>In an interview about that report with the Associated Press, Tillerson described a vision of long-term reliance on fossil fuels. “There will come a time when all the resources that are supplying the world’s economies today are going to go in decline. [Arctic oil reserves] will be what’s needed next. If we start today it’ll take 20, 30, 40 years for those to come on,” he <A href=""http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/exxon-ceo-talks-arctic-oil-drilling-risks-lessons"">said</A>. “It’s back to that insatiable appetite that the world has for energy. Oil demand is going to continue to grow.”</P><P><U>Tillerson’s understanding</U> of <mark>climate</mark> science and his stance on the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement could have major consequences for the planet. As secretary of state, he would become the agreement’s steward, playing a key role in determining how quickly countries de<mark>carbon</mark>ize their economies and in holding the U.S. to its emissions pledges.</P><P>Failure to meet the Paris goal would likely have dire consequences for global populations. But the possibility of success is already spelling trouble for Exxon Mobil, because an agreement to burn fewer fossil fuels inevitably reduces the value of the vast oil and gas reserves currently held by the major oil companies.</P><P>In fact,the SEC in August began <A href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-investigating-exxon-on-valuing-of-assets-accounting-practices-1474393593"">investigating</A> whether the company was overvaluing the reserves that it plans to sell in the future. Similar probes have been launched by Attorneys General Eric Schneiderman of New York and Maura Healey of Massachussetts. A key aspect of those investigations is the question of whether Exxon Mobil deceived shareholders by failing to disclose its own decades of research, exposed by <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/content/Exxon-The-Road-Not-Taken"">Inside <mark>Climate</mark> News</A> and the <A href=""http://graphics.latimes.com/exxon-arctic/"">Los Angeles Times</A>, indicating <mark>climate change</mark> regulations could eventually prevent its product from going to market.</P><P>“Tillerson spent his career at a company whose current business model hinges on the failure of international efforts to address <mark>climate change</mark>, so that is really core to his entire working career and the DNA that he would bring to the role of secretary of state,” said Kathy Mulvey, corporate accountability campaigns director for Union of Concerned Scientists.</P><P>As secretary of state, Tillerson would be able to launch technology sharing programs like the <A href=""https://theintercept.com/2016/05/23/hillary-clinton-fracking/"">Global Shale Initiative</A>, launched under Hillary Clinton’s State Department, which involved teaching other countries to frack. He could help start electrification programs in energy-poor nations, like the State Department’s Power Africa program — although perhaps not with the current emphasis on renewables that has <A href=""http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/Energy-Voices/2014/0808/Why-Obama-is-spending-billions-on-clean-energy-to-Power-Africa"">angered</A> the coal industry. And in his tricky diplomatic negotiations he’d be able to use energy as a bargaining chip.</P><P>“You have a situation internationally where the big part of the <mark>climate</mark> problem that’s not being faced is the expansion of the fossil fuel industry. That is the part that Tillerson won’t touch,” Kretzmann said. “If you had a classic, full-on <mark>climate</mark> denier, the world would be that much more clear that they had to take leadership on their own. … People are going to say, ‘Well, we can talk to him on <mark>climate</mark>.’ And that’s going to be a problem.”</P><P>In fact, Tillerson repeatedly urged approval of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have shipped tar sands oil out of the Kearl project, one of three Canadian oil sands projects that currently <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/29092016/exxon-mobil-change-change-investigation-oil-sands-tar-sands-alberta-canada-sec"">comprise</A> more than a third of Exxon’s liquid reserves.

	Buying time</H3><P>Kivalina has been at its current location since its school was built in the early 1900s. In 2000, the community settled on a nearby—and potentially safer—site for relocation, dubbed Kiniktuuraq. However, investigations by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determined that Kiniktuuraq could also fall victim to <mark>climate change</mark> impacts over time. Thus, the search for a new home for Kivalina residents continues.</P><P>In the meantime, the community has undertaken measures to buy them some time. Several beach protection measures have been tested over the past decade, but all have failed. In fact, one particularly costly effort failed in a large storm just days after its completion, worsening rather than improving erosion. After visiting the damage in Kivalina, the late U.S. Senator Ted Stevens helped sponsor legislation to authorize erosion control projects in several affected communities. Through this program, the Army Corps completed a rock revetment in 2010. Installation of this structure reduced the size of Kivalina, but bought the community at least a decade to make a relocation decision.</P><DIV class=""embed embed-left""><ARTICLE role=""article"" class=""node node--image node--promoted node--feature node--image--feature""><DIV class=""node__content""><DIV class=""field field--name-field-image-description field--type-text-long field--label-hidden""><DIV class=""field__items""><DIV class=""field__item even""><P>Kivalina before (left) and after (right) installation of a rock revetment in 2010—the revetment can be seen as the light-colored strip of rocks to the side of the village in the photo at right. A new rock revetment wall has a projected lifespan of 15 to 20 years.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV><H3>
	Turning waste into energy</H3><P>Since Kivalina is limited in size by the encroaching sea and the revetment, housing has become scarce, leading to overcrowding and poor sanitation—an immediate threat to health. Household sewage is hauled in “honeybuckets” to four disposal bunkers located throughout the community. Currently, residents transport their solid waste to a landfill located just over a mile from town. This poses a contamination threat to fisheries during storms, particularly in the Kivalina lagoon east of the city. Additionally, the dump site lacks a perimeter fence and draws wild animals, including bears.</P><P>To revamp the village sanitation system, a biochar sanitation system is being designed to turn human and solid waste into <mark>sustainable</mark> energy. The <mark>Climate</mark> Foundation—winner of a Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation's &quot;Reinvent the Toilet Challenge&quot; grant—will work with Kivalina leaders and Re-Locate, a group of social artists formed to help with Kivalina's relocation efforts, to apply its success at developing innovative waste management technology around the world to benefit Kivalina and other Arctic communities. The nearby Red Dog Mine, which employs some Kivalina residents, is providing funding for the project's reactor, demonstrating how public-private partnerships can help both parties thrive.</P><H3>
	Working together to study permanent relocation solutions</H3><P>Each year, estimated relocation costs increase, with some estimates for moving the approximately 400 residents ranging from $100 to $400 million—up to a million dollars per person.</P><P>In recent years, the Native Village of Kivalina has engaged diverse federal, state, regional, and local partners in quarterly planning meetings and has involved community members in all relocation efforts. Some preliminary studies have been completed—a lagoon causeway study, a reconnaissance study, and an aerial mapping project—but state budget constraints have slowed others.</P><P>There is no means to leave the island on foot or by vehicle during a storm, and transport by boat or plane in storm conditions would be dangerous. Thus, plans for an evacuation road have been in development for several years.</P><DIV class=""embed embed-left""><ARTICLE role=""article"" class=""node node--image node--promoted node--feature node--image--feature""><DIV class=""node__content""><DIV class=""field field--name-field-image-description field--type-text-long field--label-hidden""><DIV class=""field__items""><DIV class=""field__item even""><P>The airstrip in Kivalina cannot be used for evacuation: severe storms make it too dangerous, and erosion continues to threaten its existence. An alternative evacuation and relocation road is being studied. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV><P>In January 2012, the village of Kivalina voted to seek permission to build a new school seven miles inland, on a hill called Kisimigiiqtuq, which appears to have stable soils and greater safety from ocean storms. Once further suitability studies on this or another site have been completed and been approved, the Northwest Arctic Borough School District can use funding received from the State of Alaska to build a new school. On July 1, 2015, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina joined councils to discuss changing the evacuation road project to a relocation project to support this development. Through its Department of Community and Regional Affairs, the State of Alaska currently assists the community with a relocation coordinator to further interagency efforts to finalize this or another relocation solution.</P><H3>
	Global support for permanent solutions</H3><P>The residents of Kivalina have also engaged non-profit organizations and the international community in their plight, and have sought new sources for future funding of their relocation effort. For instance, the group Re-Locate received a $500,000 ArtPlace grant to fund a village-based planning hub for Kivalina, which will be housed in the village's community center. Planned projects included a living archive, large-scale models and drawings of Kivalina’s traditional territory, sanitation technology demonstration projects, and artists in residence.</P><DIV class=""embed embed-left""><ARTICLE role=""article"" class=""node node--image node--promoted node--feature node--image--feature""><DIV class=""node__content""><DIV class=""field field--name-field-image-description field--type-text-long field--label-hidden""><DIV class=""field__items""><DIV class=""field__item even""><P>Kivalina's homes and critical infrastructure remain at constant risk of increasing erosion, with relocation as the only long-term option.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV><P>Kivalina IRA President Millie Hawley says that this is a process that “belongs to the people of Kivalina.

It is a great privilege and responsibility to manage the assets clients have entrusted to us, most of which are invested for long-term goals such as retirement. As a fiduciary, BlackRock <A href=""/corporate/about-us/investment-stewardship"" title=""Learn how we protect our clients' assets for the long term."">engages with companies</A><SPAN> </SPAN>to drive the <mark>sustainable</mark>, long-term growth that our clients need to meet their goals.</P><P>In 2017, equities enjoyed an extraordinary run – with record highs across a wide range of sectors – and yet popular frustration and apprehension about the future simultaneously reached new heights. We are seeing a paradox of high returns and high anxiety. Since the financial crisis, those with capital have reaped enormous benefits. At the same time, many individuals across the world are facing a combination of low rates, low wage growth, and inadequate retirement systems. Many don’t have the financial capacity, the resources, or the tools to save effectively; those who are invested are too often over-allocated to cash. For millions, the prospect of a secure retirement is slipping further and further away – especially among workers with less education, whose job security is increasingly tenuous. I believe these trends are a major source of the anxiety and polarization that we see across the world today.</P><P>We also see many governments failing to prepare for the future, on issues ranging from retirement and infrastructure to automation and worker retraining. As a result, society increasingly is turning to the private sector and asking that companies respond to broader societal challenges. Indeed, the public expectations of your company have never been greater. Society is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose. To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society. Companies must benefit all of their stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, and the communities in which they operate.</P><P>Without a sense of purpose, no company, either public or private, can achieve its full potential. It will ultimately lose the license to operate from key stakeholders. It will succumb to short-term pressures to distribute earnings, and, in the process, sacrifice investments in employee development, <mark>innovation</mark>, and capital expenditures that are necessary for long-term growth. It will remain exposed to activist campaigns that articulate a clearer goal, even if that goal serves only the shortest and narrowest of objectives. And ultimately, that company will provide subpar returns to the investors who depend on it to finance their retirement, home purchases, or higher education.</P><H2>A new model forcorporate governance</H2><P>Globally, investors’ increasing use of index funds is driving a transformation in BlackRock’s fiduciary responsibility and the wider landscape of corporate governance. In the $1.7 trillion in active funds we manage, BlackRock can choose to sell the securities of a company if we are doubtful about its strategic direction or long-term growth. In managing our index funds, however, BlackRock cannot express its disapproval by selling the company’s securities as long as that company remains in the relevant index. As a result, our responsibility to engage and vote is more important than ever. In this sense, index investors are the ultimate long-term investors – providing patient capital for companies to grow and prosper.</P><P>Just as the responsibilities your company faces have grown, so too have the responsibilities of asset managers. We must be active, engaged agents on behalf of the clients invested with BlackRock, who are the true owners of your company. This responsibility goes beyond casting proxy votes at annual meetings – it means investing the time and resources necessary to foster long-term value.</P><P>The time has come for a new model of shareholder engagement – one that strengthens and deepens communication between shareholders and the companies that they own. <A href=""/corporate/literature/press-release/2017-ldf-ceo-letter.pdf"" target=""_blank"" title=""Read Larry Fink’s 2017 corporate governance letter to CEOs."">I have written before</A><SPAN> </SPAN>that companies have been too focused on quarterly results; similarly, shareholder engagement has been too focused on annual meetings and proxy votes. If engagement is to be meaningful and productive – if we collectively are going to focus on benefitting shareholders instead of wasting time and money in proxy fights – then engagement needs to be a year-round conversation about improving long-term value.</P><P>BlackRock recognizes and embraces our responsibility to help drive this change. Over the past several years, we have undertaken a concentrated effort to evolve our approach, led by<SPAN> </SPAN><A href=""https://www.blackrock.com/investing/biographies/michelle-edkins"" target=""_blank"" title=""Read Michelle Edkins's full biography."">Michelle Edkins</A>, our global head of investment stewardship. Since 2011, Michelle has helped transform our practice from one predominantly focused on proxy voting towards an approach based on engagement with companies.</P><P>The growth of indexing demands that we now take this function to a new level. Reflecting the growing importance of investment stewardship, I have asked<SPAN> </SPAN><A href=""/corporate/about-us/leadership/barbara-novick"" title=""Read Barbara Novick's full biography."">Barbara Novick</A>, Vice Chairman and a co-founder of BlackRock, to oversee the firm’s efforts. Michelle will continue to lead the global investment stewardship group day-to-day. We also intend to double the size of the investment stewardship team over the next three years. The growth of our team will help foster even more effective engagement with your company by building a framework for deeper, more frequent, and more productive conversations.</P><H2>Your strategy, your board, andyour purpose</H2><P>In order to make engagement with shareholders as productive as possible, companies must be able to describe their strategy for long-term growth. I want to reiterate our request, outlined in past letters, that you publicly articulate your company’s strategic framework for long-term value creation and explicitly affirm that it has been reviewed by your board of directors. This demonstrates to investors that your board is engaged with the strategic direction of the company. When we meet with directors, we also expect them to describe the Board process for overseeing your strategy.</P><P>The statement of long-term strategy is essential to understanding a company’s actions and policies, its preparation for potential challenges, and the context of its shorter-term decisions. Your company’s strategy must articulate a path to achieve financial performance. To sustain that performance, however, you must also understand the societal impact of your business as well as the ways that broad, structural trends – from slow wage growth to rising automation to <mark>climate change</mark> – affect your potential for growth.</P><P>These strategy statements are not meant to be set in stone – rather, they should continue to evolve along with the business environment and explicitly recognize possible areas of investor dissatisfaction. Of course, we recognize that the market is far more comfortable with 10Qs and colored proxy cards than complex strategy discussions. But a central reason for the rise of activism – and wasteful proxy fights – is that companies have not been explicit enough about their long-term strategies.</P><P>In the United States, for example, companies should explain to investors how the significant changes to tax law fit into their long-term strategy. What will you do with increased after-tax cash flow, and how will you use it to create long-term value? This is a particularly critical moment for companies to explain their long-term plans to investors. Tax changes will embolden those activists with a short-term focus to demand answers on the use of increased cash flows, and companies who have not already developed and explained their plans will find it difficult to defend against these campaigns. The U.S. tax bill is only one such example – regardless of a company’s jurisdiction, it is your responsibility to explain to shareholders how major legislative or regulatory changes will impact not just next year’s balance sheet, but also your long-term strategy for growth.</P><P>Where activists do offer valuable ideas – which is more often than some detractors suggest – we encourage companies to begin discussions early, to engage with shareholders like BlackRock, and to bring other critical stakeholders to the table. But when a company waits until a proxy proposal to engage or fails to express its long-term strategy in a compelling manner, we believe the opportunity for meaningful dialogue has often already been missed.</P><P>The board’s engagement in developing your long-term strategy is essential because an engaged board and a long-term approach are valuable indicators of a company’s ability to create long-term value for shareholders. Just as we seek deeper conversation between companies and shareholders, we also ask that directors assume deeper involvement with a firm’s long-term strategy. Boards meet only periodically, but their responsibility is continuous. Directors whose knowledge is derived only from sporadic meetings are not fulfilling their duty to shareholders. Likewise, executives who view boards as a nuisance only undermine themselves and the company’s prospects for long-term growth.</P><P>We also will continue to emphasize the importance of a diverse board. Boards with a diverse mix of genders, ethnicities, career experiences, and ways of thinking have, as a result, a more diverse and aware mindset. They are less likely to succumb to groupthink or miss new threats to a company’s business model. And they are better able to identify opportunities that promote long-term growth.</P><P>Furthermore, the board is essential to helping a company articulate and pursue its purpose, as well as respond to the questions that are increasingly important to its investors, its consumers, and the communities in which it operates. In the current environment, these stakeholders are demanding that companies exercise leadership on a broader range of issues. And they are right to: a company’s ability to manage environmental, social, and governance matters demonstrates the leadership and good governance that is so essential to <mark>sustainable</mark> growth, which is why we are increasingly integrating these issues into our investment process.</P><P>Companies must ask themselves: What role do we play in the community? How are we managing our impact on the environment? Are we working to create a diverse workforce? Are we adapting to technological change? Are we providing the retraining and opportunities that our employees and our business will need to adjust to an increasingly automated world? Are we using behavioral finance and other tools to prepare workers for retirement, so that they invest in a way that will help them achieve their goals?</P><P>As we enter 2018, BlackRock is eager to participate in discussions about long-term value creation and work to build a better framework for serving all your stakeholders. Today, our clients – who are your company’s owners – are asking you to demonstrate the leadership and clarity that will drive not only their own investment returns, but also the prosperity and security of their fellow citizens. We look forward to engaging with you on these issues.</P><P>Sincerely,</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""ls-cmp-wrap"" id=""w1484203195100""><DIV class=""iw_component"" id=""c1484203195100""><DIV data-componentname=""Bio"" class=""vi16""><DIV class=""bio""><DIV class=""wrapper-980 ""><DIV class=""item

It also seeks to develop shale gas resources in Britain and hopes to drill test wells this year.</P><P>Building new gas-fired power plants to fill a gap caused by a three-year delay in Hinkley Point C could save the U.K. 3.2 billion pounds through 2030, according to <A itemscope=""itemscope"" itemprop=""StoryLink"" href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/621400/Detailed_value_for_money_assessment.pdf"" title=""Click to view webpage."" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">analysis</A> by BEIS that assumes low gas prices.

It expects a price on greenhouse gas emissions to “add greater weight to the costs of gas in the 2030s, 2040s and beyond.”</P><P>The government has been supportive of natural gas and should continue to encourage production and consumption of the fuel, according to Crotty.

On Tuesday, China confirmed that it’s building what will become the biggest market for the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions that stem from burning fossil fuels. The program will force utilities to pay for at least some permits to release <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, encouraging them to invest in equipment that will use fuel more efficiently and reduce <mark>pollution</mark>.</P><H3>1. How significant is China’s <mark>carbon</mark> market?</H3><P>China’s participation in <mark>carbon</mark> trading would boost the portion of emissions covered by pricing worldwide to almost 25 percent. It creates a financial incentive for power companies in China to cut emissions and favor cleaner power generation. <mark>Pollution</mark> is still rising three decades after almost 200 nations led by the U.S. endorsed the United Nations Framework Convention on <mark>climate change</mark>, a treaty to limit fossil-fuel emissions. <mark>Carbon</mark> markets, along with cheaper renewable energy, have started to slow that growth.</P><H3>2. What is the <mark>carbon</mark> market supposed to do in China?</H3><P>The market is supposed to help clean the air and reward companies and executives for switching to cleaner systems. It provides a carrot because companies that can cut emissions quickly can sell spare allowances for profit. On the stick side, companies that fail to comply may be fined or have to pay for more permits to pollute.</P><H3>3. Will this impact <mark>carbon</mark> trading in Europe or the U.S.?</H3><P>Not yet, but it might. China’s push for its own market may embolden authorities in Europe and the parts of the U.S. where <mark>carbon</mark> markets operate to strengthen theirs. More than a decade after <mark>carbon</mark> trading started in Europe, prices remain at less than half of the 20 euros-a-ton level that industry analysts say is needed to spur real change. Having China involved blunts concern that industries will move away from places where <mark>carbon</mark> trading flourishes, since one of the big potential destinations for factories to relocate would now be covered.</P><H3>4. Is China becoming more ambitious on <mark>carbon</mark> trading?</H3><P>China is moving more carefully in erecting its market. A year ago, authorities were considering a nationwide system that would cover 7,000 companies. The program confirmed on Dec. 19 includes only 1,700 companies in the utility industry, and it isn’t clear whether it will extend across the whole of China or just to nine provinces, said Sophie Lu, a researcher at Bloomberg New Energy Finance in Beijing.</P><H3>5. What’s still being worked out?</H3><P>The government has yet to say when trading will start. Traders also will want to know how many of the emissions permits will be handed out for free and how any auctions of allowances will work, whether there will be fines for non-compliance and what the timetable is for bringing more companies under the system. Further out, it will be interesting to see if China moves to link its market with trading in Europe and the Americas.</P><H3>The Reference Shelf</H3><UL><LI><A itemscope=""itemscope"" itemprop=""StoryLink"" href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/view/quicktake/<mark>carbon</mark>-markets-2-0"" title=""<mark>Carbon</mark> Pricing Spreads Along With Debate About Payoff: QuickTake"" target=""_blank"">QuickTake explainer </A>on the spread of <mark>carbon</mark> pricing and the debate about its effectiveness. </LI><LI>The World Bank’s </LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></MAIN></BODY></HTML>",2.0,0.0,

The Barack Obama administration’s CAFE standards require each automaker’s fleet to average 54.5 miles a gallon by 2025. (Carmakers can lower their targets by earning — or buying from their competitors — credits for adopting EPA-approved technologies such as energy-conserving air conditioning or making electric cars.) Environmentalists, and states like California that love them, are up in arms.</P><P>But the administration has a point — if not the courage to do better. CAFE standards are an absurdly indirect way to regulate emissions. And Ford’s decision demonstrates why.</P><P>Consider another energy-sucking invention that Americans love even more than their cars: mobile phones. In an <A href=""https://www.tomsguide.com/us/smartphones-best-battery-life,review-2857.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">independent trial</A> conducted by consumer site Tom’s Guide, the Apple iPhone 8’s battery held its charge for 11 hours, 16 minutes, making it the longest-lasting in the Apple lineup. By contrast, the Asus ZenFone 3 Zoom topped the list at 16 hours, 46 minutes. The iPhone X, which Tom’s Guide has rated the “best phone overall,” scored a <A href=""https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-smartphones,review-2223.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">mere 10 hours, 49 minutes.</A></P><P>Different phones aimed at different consumers offer different features. Different companies pursue different strategies. They make different trade-offs between performance, battery life and cost. A company can offer a full line of phones or specialize. It can sell feature phones with batteries that last for days or souped-up smartphones with fancy screens that gobble power. None of this is controversial. There is no federal law mandating that every company’s lineup of phones average an 18-hour battery life by 2025. That would be ridiculous. Why should Apple change its iPhone designs or sell feature phones just to hit an arbitrary average?</P><P>But that’s exactly what happens with automobiles.</P><P><A href=""https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/corporate-average-fuel-economy"" itemprop=""StoryLink"" itemscope=""itemscope"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">CAFE regulations</A> implicitly assume that every carmaker offers a full assortment of vehicles. Higher average requirements distort corporate strategies and encourage companies that are good at making trucks to make compact cars as well, even if their customers don’t want them. This artificially induced competition, often at giveaway prices, hurts manufacturers that are good at making small cars. The credit system ameliorates this effect by allowing small-car specialists to sell their credits to competitors who produce larger vehicles, but only in a roundabout way.</P><P>In the real world, on real streets, emissions depend not on car dealers’ full offerings but on individual vehicles and the people who drive them. One drawback of CAFE standards is that they apply only to new cars, a tiny fraction of those on the road. So they take a long time to reduce actual emissions. The rest of us happily go on driving our out-of-date vehicles, using just as much gasoline as ever.</P><P>That gets to the second behavioral problem: Better gas mileage encourages people to drive more. CAFE targets are not, in fact, emissions standards. They were established as a response to the oil shocks of the 1970s, not to global warming. They were designed to conserve fuel. In a new, CAFE-approved gas-sipping car, you can go farther for the same amount of money.</P><P>The rules survive because the costs are hidden in corporate income statements rather than being made explicit at the gas pump. CAFE standards tell drivers that emissions are someone else’s problem. But that’s also why they fall short. They give the real decision makers — drivers — no reason to change their behavior.</P><P>It makes perfect sense for Ford to make trucks rather than cars, just as it does for <mark>Toyota Motor Corp.</mark> to make hybrids. Whether the target is cars or smartphones, however, it makes no sense to dictate a company’s product offering in order to pretend to fight <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><DIV class=""trashline"">(<SPAN itemprop=""description"">Several readers have pointed out that this article, published April 27, uses an outdated description of CAFE standards.

While the Forties pipeline had great significance in BP’s history, our business here is now centred around our major offshore interests west of Shetland and in the Central North Sea. </P><P>“The pipeline has long been an important feedstock supplier to <mark>INEOS</mark> at Grangemouth. We believe that through also owning FPS, <mark>INEOS</mark> will be able to realise greater integration benefits and help secure a competitive long-term future for this important piece of UK oil and gas infrastructure.”</P><P>Built, owned and operated by BP, the Forties pipeline was opened in 1975 to transport oil from the Forties field, the UK’s first major offshore oil field. Today FPS carries liquids production from some 85 fields in the Central and Northern North Sea and several Norwegian fields on behalf of around 40 companies. The system has a capacity of 575,000 barrels of oil a day. BP sold its interests in the Forties field to Apache in 2003 and sold the Grangemouth refinery and chemical plants to <mark>INEOS</mark> in 2005.</P><P><mark>INEOS</mark> chairman and chief executive officer Jim Ratcliffe commented: “The North Sea continues to present new opportunities for <mark>INEOS</mark>. The Forties Pipeline System is a UK strategic asset and was originally designed to work together to feed the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical facilities. We have a strong track record of acquiring non-core assets improving their efficiency and reliability, securing long term employment and investment. I am delighted that we can now bring this integrated system back under single ownership in <mark>INEOS</mark>.”</P><P>Mark Thomas, BP North Sea Regional President said: “This allows us to further focus our North Sea business around our core offshore assets - bringing new fields into production, redeveloping and renewing existing producing facilities and acquiring and exploring new acreage and interests through licence rounds and farm-ins. </P><P>“As with our recent agreement with EnQuest, we believe this is a good example of having the ‘right assets’ in the ‘right hands’, offering new opportunities for the assets and benefitting the UKCS, in the spirit of the government’s aim of maximising economic recovery of the UK’s oil and gas resources.” </P><P>FPS is expected to transition to <mark>INEOS</mark> as a fully operational entity with those staff who operate and support the various elements of the business expected to transfer with the business. Their contractual terms and conditions are protected under UK Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations (TUPE). </P><P>Around 300 BP staff are currently associated with operating and supporting the FPS business at Kinneil, Falkirk, Dalmeny, Aberdeen and offshore. BP will now begin consultation with in-scope staff for both the unionised and non-unionised populations.</P><P>Subject to the receipt of regulatory and other third party approvals, BP aims to complete the sale and transfer of operatorship during 2017.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV data-component-name=""richtext"" data-component-container=""true"" class=""nv-richtext-component nv-component section""><DIV class=""nv-richtext""><H3>Notes to editors</H3><UL><LI>The FPS system primarily comprises a 169 kilometre (105 mile), 36” pipeline from the unmanned offshore Forties Unity platform to the onshore terminal at Cruden Bay.

The former are a combination of light and radar instruments mounted on the top of vehicles that use imaging in a 360-degree environment from a radar and light beams to measure the speed and distance of surrounding objects. Along with sensors placed along the front, sides, and back of vehicles, these instruments provide information that keeps fast-moving cars and trucks in their own lane, avoids other vehicles, applies brakes and steering when needed, and does so instantly so as to avoid accidents.</P><P>Because these cameras and sensors compile a huge amount of information and needs to process it instantly in order to avoid the vehicle in the next lane, autonomous vehicles require high performance computing, advanced algorithms, and deep learning systems to adapt to new scenarios. This means that software is the key, not the physical car or truck itself.</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""right-pullquote""><P>This means that software is the key, not the physical car or truck itself.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Advanced software enables cars to learn from the experiences of other vehicles on the road and adjust their guidance systems as weather, driving, or road conditions shift. Onboard systems can learn from other vehicles on the road through machine-to-machine communications.</P><P>Autonomous vehicles are likely to spread in niche markets before they become popular in the broader consumer market. The initial cost of automated cars will be high, due to the addition of cameras, sensors, lasers, and artificial intelligence systems, therefore precluding adoption by the typical consumer. Rather, businesses and niche areas are positioned to be the early adopters. The most likely adopters include those with an interest in ride-sharing cars, buses, taxis, trucks, delivery vehicles, transport vehicles for senior citizens and the disabled, and industrial applications.</P><P>Ride-sharing companies are very interested in autonomous vehicles. They see advantages in terms of customer service and labor productivity. All of the major ride-sharing companies are exploring driverless cars. The surge of car sharing and taxi services such as Uber and Lyft in the United States, Daimler’s Mytaxi and Hailo services in Europe, and Didi Chuxing in China demonstrate the viability of this transportation option.</P><P>Delivery vehicles and “platoon” trucks traveling together represent another area likely to see quick adoption of autonomous vehicles. Purchases through online platforms and e-commerce sites are rising rapidly, and this has been a boon to home delivery firms. People want to order things electronically and get them delivered within hours.</P><H2>Benefits of autonomous vehicles</H2><P>Highway deaths are a major problem around the world. In the United States, an estimated 35,000 people die in auto accidents each year. Worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, 1.24 million people die annually due to highway accidents.<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">3</SUP> It is estimated that traffic fatalities cost $260 billion each year and that accident injuries account for another $365 billion. This represents a total of $625 billion annually from highway fatalities and injuries.<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">4</SUP></P><P>According to a RAND study, “39 percent of the crash fatalities in 2011 involved alcohol use by one of the drivers.”<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">5</SUP> This is an area where autonomous vehicles almost certainly will produce major gains in terms of lives saved and injuries avoided. Around 94 percent of U.S. vehicular accidents involve human error, and therefore are potentially avoidable.<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">6</SUP></P><P>Traffic congestion is a problem in virtually every large metropolitan area. In the United States, for example, drivers spend an average of 40 hours stuck in traffic, at an annual cost of $121 billion.<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">7</SUP> Research by Donald Shoup has found that up to 30 percent of the traffic in metropolitan areas is due to drivers circling business districts in order to find a near-by parking space.<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">8</SUP> That represents a major source of traffic congestion, air <mark>pollution</mark>, and environmental degradation. Cars are thought to be responsible for “approximately 30% of the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (<mark>CO2</mark>) emissions behind <mark>climate change</mark>.”<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">9</SUP></P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""pullquote""><P>Autonomous vehicles can save on fuel and provide benefits for the environment as a whole.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Automobiles are major contributors to poor quality air. According to a RAND study, “AV [autonomous vehicle] technology can improve fuel economy, improving it by 4-10 percent by accelerating and decelerating more smoothly than a human driver.”<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">10</SUP> Since smog in industrial areas is linked to the number of vehicles, having more autonomous cars is likely to reduce air <mark>pollution</mark>. A 2016 research study estimated that “<mark>pollution</mark> levels inside cars at red lights or in traffic jams are up to 40 percent higher than when traffic is moving.”<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">11</SUP></P><H2>Needed actions</H2><P>The biggest U.S. challenge is overcoming the fragmentation of 50 state governments and implementing uniform guidelines across geographic boundaries. Public officials should address questions such as who will regulate autonomous vehicle technology and how will it be regulated and issues such as legal liability, privacy, and data collection.</P><H3><EM>Provide guidelines for the states</EM></H3><P>Right now, there are few agreed-upon technical standards and a hodgepodge of regulation at the state government levels.<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">12</SUP> Industry officials have to deal with 50 sets of state rules that can differ dramatically. According to Chris Urmson, formerly of Google, “in the past two years, 23 states have introduced 53 pieces of legislation that affect self-driving cars – all of which include different approaches and concepts. Five states have passed such legislation, and – although all were intended to assist the development of the technology in the state – none of those laws feature common definitions, licensing structures or sets of expectations for what manufacturers should be doing.”<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">13</SUP> All of this complicates the task of car developers who need a more unified approach. Companies can’t design cars for Texas that won’t operate in Illinois, Florida, or New York.</P><FIGURE id=""id=&quot;attachment_334852&quot; "" class=""wp-caption aligncenter size-article-inline""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">Cars travel north towards Los Angeles on interstate highway 5 in San Diego, California February 10, 2016. Picture taken February 10. To match Insight AUTOS-AUTONOMOUS/INFRASTRUCTURE REUTERS/Mike Blake – RTSCYIN</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>California, in particular, has passed legislation that is overly restrictive. It sets back fully autonomous vehicles by requiring a driver in the front seat and prevents companies from removing human-operated steering wheels and brakes. That restriction potentially negates some of the benefits of driverless cars while also creating a barrier to <mark>innovation</mark> in the automotive industry.</P><P>In an effort to simplify the regulatory apparatus, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is expected to release new rules designed to promote <mark>innovation</mark> while protecting consumer safety. Among the likely features are the provision of guidelines for uniform regulations in the states, providing exemptions to outmoded safety regulations, operational guidance for new features, and new tools for encouraging autonomous vehicles.</P><P>But in a setback for manufacturers, the national government is insisting that fully autonomous vehicles retain a steering wheel and brakes, and that there be a licensed driver in the car. Some designers argue that having those override features opens the door to drunk drivers and creates a dangerous sense of complacency for drivers.</P><H3><EM>Address legal liability</EM></H3><P>Consumers cite lower insurance costs as one of the things they like about autonomous vehicles. Almost one-third gave that reason, followed by increased safety and switches to self-driving model as reasons they would buy a partially autonomous vehicle.</P><P>It is not clear, though, how insurance companies will handle liability claims in the new world of transportation. Is the accident the fault of the driver, the writer of the software code that controls automated features, or the car manufacturer who made the hardware? It will take some law suits to resolve attributions of responsibility. Insurance firms will take a while to develop actuarial tables based on accident records so they know what premiums to charge drivers.</P><P>A RAND study recommends “no fault” insurance for autonomous vehicles. Its rationale is that driverless cars are less prone to human errors and therefore they represent a fundamental change in legal liability.<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">14</SUP> Driverless cars essentially shift more of the responsibility from drivers to manufacturers and software designers.</P><P>For the latter, product liability law is a promising way to think about legal responsibility. Manufacturers are responsible for defective conditions so their liability would hinge on whether there was a reasonable expectation than their products would operate as expected and not pose undue risks to passengers.</P><H3><EM>Improve data protection and security</EM></H3><P>Data collected through vehicles enable new business models. For example, in the insurance industry, “a connected vehicle allows an insurance company to really look at you individually in terms of your actual driving and your real risk and real time situational awareness, so they can innovate a lot of products and a lot of pricing strategies aimed at trying to keep you out of harm’s way, and almost pivot from selling insurance to selling assurance.”<SUP class=""endnote-pointer"">15</SUP></P><DIV class=""inline-widget alignleft""><H3>Related Books</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1.0,0.0,Neutral

      city of Davos and <mark>ABB</mark> have teamed up in a long-term partnership to 
      provide e-infrastructure for public and private transportation.
    </P><P>
      Davos residents and WEF guests can experience the pioneering TOSA bus 
      for themselves. The award-winning TOSA bus, developed by <mark>ABB</mark> in 
      Switzerland, is already in use in Geneva and will soon be implemented in 
      the French city of Nantes. It can recharge its battery in just 20 
      seconds as passengers board and disembark. In Davos, it will operate on 
      the busy Line 1, running from the tourist center to the hospital. This 
      is the first time TOSA technology is being used in an Alpine region. The 
      idea is to run the system under extreme winter weather conditions; <mark>ABB</mark> 
      and its project partners expect to gain valuable insights from this 
      pilot project.
    </P><P>
      In addition, electric cars transporting attendees around Davos will be 
      able to recharge their batteries at eight newly installed <mark>ABB</mark> 
      fast-charging stations.
    </P><P>
      Collectively, the TOSA e-bus and the charging stations provide a 
      powerful, real-world demonstration of state-of-the-art <mark>sustainable</mark> 
      transportation technologies, which are seeing increased deployment 
      throughout the world as e-mobility becomes the driving force for 
      bringing energy efficiency with low environmental impact to cars, buses, 
      trains, ships and cable cars.
    </P><P>
      “The shift to electric vehicles is no longer a question of if, but 
      rather of when and how quickly,” said <mark>ABB</mark> CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer. “EVs 
      are becoming increasingly attractive to motorists. As well as being 
      ecologically responsible, they're becoming less expensive to buy and 
      maintain.”
    </P><P>
      <mark>ABB</mark> is the technology leader in the fast-charging products and systems 
      that are transforming transportation in globally <mark>sustainable</mark> ways. 
      <mark>Sustainable</mark> transportation is playing a crucial role in the fight 
      against <mark>climate change</mark>, as e-mobility begins to replace 
      fossil-fuel-powered vehicles spewing greenhouse gases contributing to 
      global warming.
    </P><P><B>Fast-charging at the World Economic Forum meeting</B></P><P>
      For e-cars, <mark>ABB</mark> is already the global leader in fast charging, with more 
      than 6,000 stations installed in more than 50 countries. At Davos, world 
      leaders will get to see the eight recently installed <mark>ABB</mark> Terra 53 
      charging stations in action. The <mark>ABB</mark> Terra 53 is the best-selling 50 kW 
      DC charging station in Europe and North America, supporting the CCS, 
      CHAdeMO and simultaneous 43 kW AC charging standards.
    </P><P>
      For public transport, the all-electric TOSA e-bus at Davos is at the 
      cutting edge of <mark>sustainable</mark> transportation <mark>innovation</mark>. Indeed, TOSA 
      received the prestigious Watt d’Or 2018 in the energy efficient mobility 
      category from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy. The TOSA technology 
      was jointly developed in Switzerland by <mark>ABB</mark> in partnership with 
      Transport Publics Genevois (tpg), the Office de Promotion of Industries 
      et des Technologies (OPI), the Services Industriels de Genève (SIG), and 
      bus manufacturer Carrosserie HESS.
    </P><P>
      The same TOSA technology in use at Davos has been powering buses on 
      Geneva's bus line 23 airport route. They use overhead contacts that 
      connect at selected stops along their routes to replenish their 
      batteries in as little as 20 seconds, recharging as passengers board and 
      exit. The environmentally friendly system in Geneva could ultimately cut 
      <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions by 1,000 tons annually.
    </P><P>
      But <mark>ABB</mark>’s <mark>sustainable</mark> transportation solutions aren't limited to 
      conventional cars and buses.
    </P><P>
      <mark>ABB</mark> supplies the railway sector with innovative and energy-efficient 
      technologies like traction transformer and converter made primarily in 
      Switzerland. One example is the Rhaetian Railway that shuttles between 
      Landquart and Davos.
    </P><P>
      In the racing world, through its recently announced partnership with the 
      Formula E electric-car racing organization, <mark>ABB</mark> will help to refine the 
      design and functionality of electric vehicles and infrastructure as well 
      as associated digital platforms.
    </P><P>
      <mark>ABB</mark> is also enabling e-mobility in ocean-going tankers, freighters and 
      passenger ships. There, <mark>ABB</mark>’s <A target=""_blank"" href=""http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fnew.<mark>abb</mark>.com%2Fmarine%2Fsystems-and-solutions%2Felectric-propulsion%2Fazipod&amp;esheet=51746724&amp;newsitemid=20180122006126&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Azipod&amp;index=1&amp;md5=91ef11b58ad0e903731583e9b679b482"" rel=""nofollow"">Azipod</A> 
      propulsion systems power vessels with steerable, high-efficiency 
      electric-drive propellers, which make ships significantly more 
      maneuverable and can reduce their need for on-board fossil fuels by 40 
      percent or more.
    </P><P>
      <mark>ABB</mark> is also taking e-mobility to new heights in cable cars. <mark>ABB</mark> motors 
      power the steepest funicular cable railway in the world, which opened in 
      the Swiss Alpine village of Stoos in December 2017. The <mark>ABB</mark> motors, 
      which deliver a total output of 2.3 megawatts, enable the cable railway 
      to carry up to 1,500 people per hour in each direction over its 1.7 
      kilometer route. <mark>ABB</mark> has also provided state-of-the-art motors and 
      drives for a newly opened, record-setting gondola system carrying 580 
      passengers an hour to the Zugspitze — Germany's highest peak.
    </P><P><B><mark>ABB</mark></B> (<mark>ABB</mark>N: SIX Swiss Ex) is a pioneering technology leader in 
      electrification products, robotics and motion, industrial automation and 
      power grids, serving customers in utilities, industry and transport &amp;

Munich Re reported that it was the third-costliest year on record behind 2011 and 2005. Many of the most costly events occurred in the United States, including the <mark>devastation</mark> caused by Superstorm Sandy and the widespread, prolonged drought in the Midwest. Companies and their stakeholders—governments, employees, communities and customers—are increasingly concerned about the costs associated with more frequent and intense floods, droughts, hurricanes and wildfires. Many companies are taking steps to begin to enhance their resilience to these growing risks. However, companies traditionally have planned based on past weather events, and few have attempted to integrate the increasing risks associated with the changing <mark>climate</mark> into their planning and operations. Initial efforts to do so suggest that barriers and uncertainties often stand in the way, preventing companies from achieving resilience against the rising risks of <mark>climate change</mark> impacts.</P><P>This report, <EM>Weathering the Storm</EM>, provides an in-depth look at the ways multinational companies are beginning to assess and address the risks of extreme weather and other <mark>climate change</mark> impacts. The companies examined play strategic roles in the global economy in a wide range of sectors including banking and financial services, consumer goods, healthcare, information communications, manufacturing, and materials. The report is based on two complementary lines of research:</P><UL><LI>A comprehensive review of the perspectives and activities of companies listed in the Standard and Poor’s (S&amp;P) Global 100 Index, based on their reporting to the <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project and in their corporate sustainability reports and annual financial filings; and</LI><LI>In-depth case studies of the practices and experiences of six companies in diverse sectors: American Water, Bayer, The Hartford Group, National Grid, Rio Tinto and Weyerhaeuser.</LI></UL><P>Together, these sources provide a detailed snapshot of the state of resilience planning among a cross-section of global companies: how they perceive and talk publicly about their <mark>climate</mark>-related risks, the steps they are taking or planning to take, and the barriers that stand in their way. The research in this report also establishes a baseline that can be used to monitor risk management activities related to <mark>climate</mark> impacts over time.</P><P>Broadly speaking, the research reveals that while the vast majority of companies recognize risks from extreme weather and <mark>climate change</mark>, and many see these risks in the present or near term, uncertainty about the precise nature, timing and severity of <mark>climate</mark> impacts often inhibits investment in resilience beyond “business as usual.” A few leading companies are taking steps to address <mark>climate</mark> risks where they see significant opportunities to become more efficient, reduce costs, or provide greater value to customers—in other words, where there is a clear business case to do so. By and large, however, the business response thus far is largely a continuation of existing practices based on a historical picture of past risks, and often fails to adequately consider changing <mark>climate</mark> and weather conditions. Thus, the most common strategy for addressing <mark>climate</mark>-related risks leaves most companies without the resilience they need to weather future physical impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Beyond these broad conclusions, the report outlines a set of more detailed findings on prevailing attitudes and practices among S&amp;P Global 100 companies. And, to help encourage and inform stronger resilience efforts, it lays out a four-step framework for managing <mark>climate</mark> risks that incorporates the emerging best practices from case-study companies already working to prepare for the very likely prospect of increasing extreme weather and <mark>climate change</mark> impacts.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,0.0,

This in turn led to a drop in the supply of gas <A href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7808937.stm"">to other EU countries</A>.</P><P>Eventually, <A href=""http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/01/21/uk-russia-ukraine-gas-idUKTRE5091KI20090121?sp=true""> Russia agreed to turn the gas supply back on</A>– Ukraine agreed not to raise the price it charges Russia to allow it to keep transporting gas through the pipeline, and Ukraine got a reduced gas price in 2009. The controversy harmed consumer confidence in the relationship between Russia and Ukraine, and gave <mark>Gazprom</mark> a further incentive to look for alternative routes to transport its gas to the rest of Europe.</P><P>Secondly, the South Stream pipeline secures <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s prominent position as a key energy provider in the European gas market in the face of increasingly strong opposition. With the US set to overtake Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world’s largest oil producer by 2035 <A href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7806870.stm"">because of advances in the extraction of shale gas</A>, both <mark>Gazprom</mark> and the Russian government see this as important.</P><P>A flood of US shale gas could reduce both <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s ability to command high prices in the European market and Russia’s ability to negotiate favourable terms in the European political arena based on its status as the principal energy provider. So the South Stream pipeline marks a political win for <mark>Gazprom</mark>.</P><P><STRONG>The problem with gas</STRONG></P><P>But while the South Stream pipeline may help to entrench <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s influence in the European energy markets, securing the route is not without risks.</P><P>The <A href=""http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/05/uk-europe-coal-iea-idUKBRE8940U620121005""> International Energy Agency</A> reports that coal is likely to displace gas as Europe’s primary source of energy through to 2017, but the South Stream pipeline isn’t set to become operational until 2015. Add to that the availability of cheaper US gas, and <mark>Gazprom</mark> is unlikely to enjoy the hold it previously had on the European energy market – at least not at the prices it’s used to charging.</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> also has its own problems. <A href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/nov/15/<mark>gazprom</mark>-chill-shale-gas-revolution""> As the Guardian reports</A>, the company is now playing catch-up to the US, where gas technology and infrastructure for gas is far more developed, leaving the Russian incumbent rushing to replace its ageing network of leaky pipelines and dated extraction equipment.</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark>’s status was further reduced when it shelved plans for a flagship gas pipeline intended to foray into the <A href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ab331568-f1d8-11e1-bba3-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2CNbQKu8Y""> Arctic region</A> because of the technical difficulties in exploring the region and losing the US as chief potential importer because of its own domestic provision.</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> has also been forced to admit that its prices have been consistently <A href=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-11-08/europes-price-vengeance-on-<mark>gazprom</mark>""> too high</A>–<A href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/55c1aeb0-07c6-11e2-9df2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2CNbQKu8Y""> twice as high</A> as the price of gas in the US in September. This is because <mark>Gazprom</mark> links its gas prices to those of oil, rather than competing with the cheaper prices available for natural gas originally intended for the US.</P><P>The European Commission is also <A href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19482312"">investigating <mark>Gazprom</mark></A> for abusing its position as the dominant gas provider in Europe. The EU claims <mark>Gazprom</mark> is restricting the flow of gas to countries that do not cooperate with it (such as Ukraine), is blocking a diversification of the energy supply, and setting the price of gas at unfair levels.</P><P><STRONG><mark>Gazprom</mark>, rising and falling</STRONG></P><P>While the South Stream pipeline has political benefits for <mark>Gazprom</mark> and the Russian government, the company is still on rocky ground: the long-term prospects of gas as part of Europe’s energy mix is uncertain and the European Commission’s investigation could still spell bad news for <mark>Gazprom</mark> itself. So while the South Stream pipeline strengthens <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s position politically, the economic future looks more uncertain. </P></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",0.0,2.0,

Anglo-Swiss firm <mark>Ineos</mark> began importing US shale ethane in September last year, for use in the chemical industry. The Isle of Grain terminal on the Thames estuary took the UK’s first delivery of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from US shale in <A href=""https://www.ft.com/content/f7ea9416-616e-11e7-8814-0ac7eb84e5f1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">early July</A>.</P><P>However, the North Sea still produces the <A href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/632523/Chapter_4.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">vast majority</A> of UK gas supplies.

A spokeswoman for the firm tells <mark>Carbon</mark> Brief it plans to begin drilling horizontal wells into shale rock this month, with fracking beginning towards the end of the year.</P><P>However, the spokeswoman adds that Cuadrilla is unsure how long the process will take, since this is the first time horizontal wells have been drilled into the UK’s shale rock. (The Preese Hall site only had a vertical well). It, therefore, cannot say exactly when the first fracking will take place, she says.</P><P>Cuadrilla had originally planned to begin fracking by the third quarter of this year. An <A href=""http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/energy/2017/07/preston-new-road-how-fracking-protest-became-movement"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ongoing protest</A> at the site may be delaying development. Since January, <A href=""https://www.desmog.uk/2017/07/27/fracking-month-action-unites-local-and-national-campaigners-lancashire"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">anti-fracking protesters</A> have maintained a continuous presence outside the site.</P><P>A drilling rig owned by the firm was <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/10/drilling-rig-owned-uk-fracking-firm-cuadrilla-seriously-vandalised"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">vandalised</A> last month at a facility near Chesterfield, where it was being stored, while Cuadrilla recently <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/27/fracking-drilling-rig-smuggled-on-site-overnight-avoid-protests"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">breached</A> its planning permission by delivering a drilling rig overnight, apparently to evade the protestors.</P><P>If Cuadrilla does use fracking at the site, it would be the first time in the UK since the 2011 moratorium was put in place.</P><P>Cuadrilla also has an application for exploratory fracking at a second Lancashire site, Roseacre Wood. A public inquiry on the application is set to take place in April 2018, after a legal challenge by protesters <A href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-39622877"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">failed</A> to stop it going ahead.</P><P>It’s worth emphasising that Cuadrilla’s projects are at the exploratory stage and are not yet producing shale gas. However, Cuadrilla’s spokeswoman tells <mark>Carbon</mark> Brief that gas from its site will be “fuelling Lancashire homes and businesses mid next year”. This statement is based on Cuadrilla already having planning consent for an extended flow test, that would send small quantities of gas into the grid. Again, this would fall short of full-scale production.</P><H4>Where else are firms planning to use fracking?</H4><P>At least five other firms are planning to explore for shale gas in the UK. The interactive map below shows where they hope to operate. (Zoom in/out and mouse over or click on the dots for more information.)</P><P>Note that fracking is not necessarily set be used at all the sites shown on the map. Cuadrilla has said it will not need to carry out fracking at its oil exploration well at Balcombe, for example, since the rock is already naturally fractured. (It also says it has no current plans to continue exploration at this site, having decided to focus on shale gas extraction in Lancashire.)</P><P>(Update 24/8/2017: Note however that in a correspondence published this month in the journal <A href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v548/n7668/full/548393a.html?foxtrotcallback=true#auth-1"">Nature</A>, researchers David Smythe and Stuart Haszeldine warn fracking of unconventional oil and gas formations could risk being classed as conventional hydro<mark>carbon</mark> exploration, pointing to exploration in the Weald Basin, which Balcombe is situated within. “This results from the government using legally binding definitions of unconventional oil and gas (UOG) resources and of high-volume hydraulic fracturing (HVHF, or fracking) that have little rational or scientific basis,” they write.)</P><P class=""p1"">(Update 10/1/2018: West Sussex county council’s planning committee <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/09/fracking-firm-gets-green-light-to-drill-for-oil-at-balcombe-again"">yesterday</A> voted unanimously to approve an application by Cuadrilla to explore for oil near Balcombe. The decision comes despite more than 2,700 objections being received against the proposal, with 11 in favour. It does not give Cuadrilla permission for fracking, which would require further consents.)</P><P>The map includes Cuadrilla’s Preston New Road and Roseacre Wood sites in Lancashire, the only ones for which the firm is currently seeking permission to carry out fracking.</P><P>Also of note are three sites near Sheffield, licenced to <mark>Ineos</mark> Shale, a UK-based subsidiary of Anglo-Swiss chemical giant <mark>Ineos</mark>, which aims to drill test wells to assess the suitability of the sites for extracting shale gas. In <A href=""https://www.ft.com/content/352de042-7607-11e7-a3e8-60495fe6ca71?mhq5j=e4"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">July</A>, <mark>Ineos</mark> Shale won a broad pre-emptive injunction that will put protesters in contempt of court if they obstruct its shale operations.</P><P>Meanwhile, <A href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-40482418"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">last month</A> Third Energy submitted its final plans to start fracking for shale gas at its Kirby Misperton site in North Yorkshire. It was granted planning permission for the site in May 2016.</P><P>This plan still needs to undergo a technical assessment from the <A href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Environment Agency</A> and requires approval from the government’s <A href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/oil-and-gas-authority"">Oil and Gas Authority (OGA)</A>. A spokesman for Third Energy tells <mark>Carbon</mark> Brief it hopes to begin fracking this year.</P><H4>How much shale gas does the UK have?</H4><P>The British Geological Survey (BGS) says the UK has large amounts of shale hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s below its surface. However, the precise distribution is not yet well known and there remains significant uncertainty over how much is extractable.</P><P>The BGS has <A href=""http://www.bgs.ac.uk/shalegas/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">examined</A> how much shale resources there are in several areas of the UK (see video below). Its central estimates for these are:</P><UL><LI>Over 1,300 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of shale gas in the <A href=""https://www.ogauthority.co.uk/media/2782/bgs_decc_bowlandshalegasreport_main_report.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Bowland-Hodder</A> shale in Lancashire;</LI><LI>Around 4.4 billion barrels (bbl) of shale oil in the <A href=""http://www.bgs.ac.uk/research/energy/shaleGas/wealdShaleOil.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Weald basin</A> in Sussex, but no significant gas resource;</LI><LI>A further 1.1bbl of shale oil in part of the <A href=""https://www.ogauthority.co.uk/exploration-production/onshore/reports-bgs-wessex-area-extension-to-weald-basin-shale/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Wessex</A> basin, near the Weald basin and;</LI><LI>Some 80tcf of shale gas and 6bbl of shale oil in the <A href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/360471/BGS_DECC_MVS_2014_MAIN_REPORT.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Midland Valley of Scotland</A>.</LI></UL><P>Two things are worth emphasising here. First, these are central, fairly rough estimates. The BGS’s range for the Bowland-Hodder shale, for example, is a lower limit of 822tcf and upper limit of 2281tcf.</P><P>Most importantly, though, these are calculations of the total resources of shale. Only a fraction of this will be commercially extractable reserves, depending on the cost of UK operations and the international market price of gas.</P><P>The BGS <A href=""https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmenergy/writev/isg/m17.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">says</A> it is too early to know what proportion of UK shale resources are recoverable, although it says US recovery factors are typically around 10%. Note that shale firms <A href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/10/06/a-long-way-still-to-go-for-britains-shale-gas-revolution/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">often argue</A> they need to begin drilling before they can understand how much of the UK’s shale gas is extractable.</P><P>The UK uses around <A href=""https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmwelaf/284/28405.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">3tcf of gas</A> each year. Assuming a 10% recovery rate and the BGS’s central estimates, the UK has 138tcf, or around 46 years worth of technically extractable shale gas.</P><P>It’s worth noting a 2013 assessment by the US <A href=""https://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/worldshalegas/pdf/UK_2013.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Energy Information Administration</A> (EIA) estimated a far lower technically recoverable resource in the UK of 26tcf, equivalent to nine years of current UK gas use.</P><P>A <A href=""https://itportal.ogauthority.co.uk/web_files/promote/2015/regional_reports/Promote_UK_Shalegas_2015.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">2010 BGS estimate</A> for the Department of Energy and <mark>Climate Change</mark> (DECC) put the “total recoverable reserve potential” in the UK even lower, at just 5.3tcf. This is less than two years of use.</P><P><A href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261916301477#t0005"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Research</A> by UK-based commercial oil and gas consultancy the<A href=""https://www.energy-contract.com/""> Energy Contract Company (ECC)</A>, published in 2012, put technically recoverable shale gas far higher than this, at 40tcf, around 13 years worth.</P><P>Meanwhile, in 2013 the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology (POST) <A href=""http://www.parliament.uk/documents/post/ShaleGas_POSTbox.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">estimated</A> a potentially recoverable resource of 64-459tcf in the Bowland shale formation alone. This figure is based on a range of recovery rates of 8-20%.</P><P>There are currently no official <A href=""https://www.parliament.uk/documents/post/ShaleGas_POSTbox.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">reserve estimates</A>. As <A href=""http://www.parliament.uk/documents/post/ShaleGas_POSTbox.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">POST</A> observes, UK reserves could be anywhere from “zero” to “substantial”. It says: “To determine reliable estimates of shale gas reserves, flow rates must be analysed for a number of shale gas wells over a couple of years.”</P><H4>Where have oil and gas licences been granted?</H4><P>There are 137 ongoing oil and gas licences <A href=""http://www.ukoog.org.uk/14th-round"">granted</A> in UK government licensing rounds. The most recent, the 14th onshore licensing round, was <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/q-a-everything-you-need-to-know-about-uk-fracking"">launched</A> in 2014, the first since 2008. This resulted in another 93 licences being <A href=""https://www.ogauthority.co.uk/licensing-consents/licensing-rounds/onshore-licensing-rounds/#tabs"">given</A> to 22 successful applicants in 2015.</P><P>It’s worth noting that these <A href=""http://www.ukoog.org.uk/onshore-extraction/where-we-operate"">licences</A> do not give permission for operations, but rather grant exclusivity to licensees for exploration and extraction of any hydro<mark>carbon</mark>, including for shale gas and oil within the area.</P><P>A spokesperson for the government’s Oil and Gas Authority (OGA), tells <mark>Carbon</mark> Brief:</P><P class=""quote"">“Subject to planning permission, relevant scrutiny and other permits, a proposal for shale exploration could progress on any extant onshore licence, not just ones issued in the 13th or 14th rounds when the potential was first identified.”</P><P>However, 63 of the 93 licences granted in 2015 are in areas of potential shale exploration, according to investigative website <A href=""https://drillordrop.com/could-your-area-be-fracked-under-the-new-oil-and-gas-licences/"">Drill or Drop</A>.</P><P>The video below shows the areas of shale gas and oil potential in the UK, based on maps from the OGA.</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""instagram-media"" style=""background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);"" data-instgrm-version=""7""><DIV style=""padding: 8px;""><P style=""color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;""><A style=""color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;"" href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BX2l27El754/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">A post shared by <mark>Carbon</mark> Brief (@<mark>carbon</mark>brief)</A> on <TIME style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;"" datetime=""2017-08-16T11:28:07+00:00"">Aug 16, 2017 at 4:28am PDT</TIME></P></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>
Which parts of the UK are open to fracking? (Update: Note that the Scottish Government imposed an effective ban on fracking in October 2016).

<P>The maps show, in turn:</P><UL><LI><B>Shale oil and gas study areas. </B>Areas which have been surveyed by the British Geological Survey (BGS), a public sector research body, to see if they might contain extractable shale hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s. These are the main areas that could be used to produce shale oil or gas in the UK, according to the BGS.

This was the most recent offer of onshore oil and gas licences and only the second to explicitly include shale resources.</LI><LI><B>Total area made available for licence in 2014 </B>All areas opened for bidding in the 14th licensing round. This covers approximately two fifths of the UK.</LI></UL><P>It’s worth emphasising that some of the licences shown in the map above are for firms that intended to explore for conventional oil or gas, rather than shale gas. Edward Hough, a geologist from the BGS, tells <mark>Carbon</mark> Brief:</P><P class=""quote"">“Operators may explore for shale gas and also a conventional source of hydro<mark>carbon</mark> under the same license. In some parts of the country, shale targets may underlie conventional hydro<mark>carbon</mark> reservoirs; as such, it’s not possible to put a figure on how many licenses are for shale versus conventional oil and gas.”</P><P>In addition, companies holding licences still need to go through planning applications to gain consent for drilling, with only a couple of companies currently at this stage in just a few locations (see first map above).</P><H4>Does the UK need shale gas?</H4><P>While it’s important to consider how much of the UK’s shale gas is recoverable, perhaps the more pertinent questions are how soon it could start to flow and if it is needed.</P><P>This is crucial to the question of whether shale gas production can be ready in time to replace the UK’s <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/analysis-uk-cuts-<mark>carbon</mark>-record-coal-drop"">rapidly falling</A> coal use, the main way it could substantively cut UK greenhouse gas emissions (see below).</P><P>According to National Grid’s most recent <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/factcheck-how-much-power-will-uk-electric-vehicles-need"">Future Energy Scenarios</A>, UK gas production fell to 35 billion cubic metres (bcm; 1.2tcf) in 2016, a third of its level in 2000. This fall has been offset by a <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/six-charts-show-uk-progress-on-low-<mark>carbon</mark>-energy-slowing-down"">20% fall in demand</A>, with imports making up the difference. Similarly large falls in conventional UK gas production are expected over the next 30 years, National Grid says.</P><P>This fall in production could be offset by cutting demand further, by importing more gas, by producing domestic shale gas or a combination of all three.</P><P>To explore these options, National Grid lays out four scenarios, with shale gas included in the two with reduced <mark>climate</mark> ambition. It’s worth highlighting that these scenarios are not forecasts of what is most likely to happen, but rather potential paths, which can also serve as warnings. Only one of the scenarios meets the UK’s legally-binding <mark>carbon</mark> targets.</P><P>Its “consumer power” scenario has high gas demand and a focus on domestically produced supplies. Shale production begins around 2020, ramping up to 32bcm (1.1tcf) per year from 2031. Total annual gas use in 2050 sits at 70bcm (2.5 tcf), only 20% lower than in 2016.</P><DIV id=""attachment_27352"" style=""width: 1034px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Annual UK gas supply by source (billions of cubic metres, left axis) and the share of supplies that are imported (percent, right axis) in the Consumer Power scenario.

As <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/ccc-fracking-industry-must-meet-tough-conditions-achieve-<mark>climate</mark>-goals""><mark>Carbon</mark> Brief</A> reported at the time, it said that gas use should fall by around 50% in 2050, rising to a 80% fall if <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage is not available.</P><P>It’s worth noting that the CCC has also said UK heating must be virtually <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/ccc-uk-must-act-now-secure-zero-<mark>carbon</mark>-heat-2050"">zero-<mark>carbon</mark></A> by 2050, with options to reach this goal including district heating schemes, low-<mark>carbon</mark> hydrogen in the gas grid (see below) and electric heat pumps.</P><H4>What does shale gas mean for greenhouse gas emissions?</H4><P>A <A href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/237330/MacKay_Stone_shale_study_report_09092013.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">2013 report</A> (pdf) co-authored by the late Prof David MacKay, then chief scientist to the Department of Energy and <mark>Climate Change</mark> (DECC), found UK shale gas would have much lower emissions than coal, slightly lower emissions than imported liquified natural gas (LNG) and higher emissions than conventional gas.</P><P>Like the CCC, this report emphasised the need to ensure UK shale gas production did not lead to an overall increase in international supply and demand for gas.</P><P>The authors warned that the “production of shale gas could increase global cumulative GHG emissions if the fossil fuels displaced by shale gas are used elsewhere”.</P><P>They concluded: “The view of the authors is that without global <mark>climate</mark> policies (of the sort already advocated by the UK) new fossil fuel exploitation is likely to lead to an increase in cumulative <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and the risk of <mark>climate change</mark>.”</P><P>Advocates have <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/<mark>climate</mark>-benefits-of-a-natural-gas-bridge-unlikely-to-be-significant"">argued</A> that shale gas could help to cut greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the use of coal. This might be possible as long as <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/explained-fugitive-methane-emissions-from-natural-gas-production"">fugitive methane</A> emissions remain below a certain level, often calculated at around 3%.</P><P>In practice, however, the UK is unlikely to be able to replace coal with domestic shale gas, given coal is being phased out of the power sector by 2025 and is <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/analysis-dramatic-shift-uk-government-outlook-gas-clean-energy"">expected</A> to fall to very low levels well before then.</P><P>This leaves the small potential emissions advantage of domestic shale gas over imported LNG.</P><P>The CCC says that onshore oil and gas extraction, including fracking, is <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/ccc-fracking-industry-must-meet-tough-conditions-achieve-<mark>climate</mark>-goals"">incompatible</A> with the UK’s <mark>climate</mark> targets unless it can meet tough standards on emissions. It laid out three key tests for a UK shale gas industry. These are:</P><UL><LI><B>Strict limits on emissions</B>. This means limiting methane leakage during development, production and well decommissioning, as well as prohibiting production that would entail significant <mark>CO2</mark> emissions from changes in land use. The CCC says current regulations fall short of these requirements.</LI><LI><B>Gas consumption in line with <mark>carbon</mark> budgets.</B> This means cutting gas consumption at least in half by 2050 and using shale gas to replace, rather than add to, current gas imports. If <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage (CCS) is not available, UK gas consumption needs to drop to around 80% below today’s levels by 2050.  A separate report, released last year by the industry-funded <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/<mark>carbon</mark>-capture-essential-for-<mark>climate</mark>-friendly-fracking-in-uk-says-industry-backed-report"">Task Force on Shale Gas</A>, concluded that CCS will be “essential” if fracking develops at scale.</LI><LI><B>Shale industry emissions offset by more cuts elsewhere.</B> This means the unavoidable emissions from a UK shale gas industry would have to be matched by cuts in other areas of the economy.  Offsetting these emissions through other sectors would be possible, but potentially difficult, the CCC said.</LI></UL><P>The CCC reiterated this advice in its latest annual <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/ccc-plan-to-fill-uk-<mark>climate</mark>-policy-gap-urgently-needed"">progress report</A>, published in June. It also said the government should implement new policies to more tightly regulate and monitor shale gas wells, in order to ensure rapid action to address <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/explained-fugitive-methane-emissions-from-natural-gas-production"">methane leaks</A>.</P><P>Meanwhile, the <A href=""http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/media/weowebsite/2011/WEO2011_GoldenAgeofGasReport.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">International Energy Agency</A> said in 2011 that the significant global development of shale gas could put the world on a trajectory towards a long-term temperature rise of over 3.5C, far above the Paris Agreement <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/explainer-the-long-term-goal-of-the-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-deal"">limit</A> of “well below 2C”.</P><H4>Could shale gas be low <mark>carbon</mark>?</H4><P>Some shale gas proponents have <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/the-<mark>carbon</mark>-brief-interview-averil-macdonald"">argued</A> it could be used to produce low-<mark>carbon</mark> hydrogen via a <A href=""https://energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-production-natural-gas-reforming"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">steam reformation process</A>, combined with CCS. The hydrogen would replace methane in the gas grid and be used for heating or fuel cells.</P><P>Depending on how tightly emissions are controlled during shale gas production, however, this might only <A href=""https://heatpolicy.wordpress.com/2016/07/15/is-hydrogen-at-hype-cycle-peak/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">cut emissions</A> by 59% compared to fossil gas. The figure also depends on what share of <mark>CO2</mark> is captured, with 100% technically possible, but likely to be more costly.</P><P>The CCC says that CCS must be under active development in the UK before a decision to <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/ccc-uk-must-act-now-secure-zero-<mark>carbon</mark>-heat-2050"">proceed with hydrogen</A> is made.

The Conservative party’s 2017 <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/election-2017-what-minfestos-say-energy-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">manifesto</A> made no mention of CCS.</P><H4>What does the government say on shale?</H4><P>The Conservative’s 2017 election manifesto set out <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/election-2017-what-minfestos-say-energy-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">ambitious plans</A> to develop the shale gas industry, in a lengthy section that spoke glowingly of its prospects.</P><P>This said that shale gas could help reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions “because [it] is cleaner than coal” (see above for more on UK shale gas and coal). The manifesto also said it “could play a crucial role in rebalancing our economy”.</P><P>The weakened Conservative administration has abandoned a string of manifesto policies since losing its majority at the general election. Last month, energy minister Richard Harrington reiterated the government’s stance on shale gas, but did not mention emissions, <A href=""http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2017-07-17/5116/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">saying</A>:</P><P class=""quote"">“Shale gas could have great potential to be a domestic energy resource that makes us less reliant on imports and opens up a wealth of job opportunities.

Nearly 90 percent of Americans want automakers to continue to improve fuel economy – leading to less emissions – and support strict government standards, <A href=""https://www.consumerreports.org/fuel-economy-efficiency/survey-finds-consumers-want-better-gas-mileage-stricter-mpg-standards/"" style=""color:#00b3fa;"">according to a recent Consumer Reports survey</A>.

				The Obama Administration listened and worked with automakers like <mark>Ford Motor Com</mark>pany to develop ambitious but achievable fuel efficiency standards for new cars and trucks that would have prevented 6 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. Even better, the standards would have saved American families $1.7 trillion in fuel costs.

The fact that energy efficiency is the thread that runs through all of <mark>ABB</mark>’s planning makes the company a strong fighter against <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>“Our crown jewels in this are our frequency converters, which were developed in Vaasa and which reduced <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions by about 340 million tonnes in 2014 worldwide. The energy they saved corresponds to the consumption of 110 million residences,” says Juha Muhonen, <mark>ABB</mark> Finland’s Sales Director in Rail and Wind.</P><DIV id=""attachment_189"" style=""max-width: 279px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">“With their energy efficiency and innovative solutions for utilising renewable energy sources, <mark>ABB</mark>’s technologies support the building of a <mark>sustainable</mark> world,” Juha Muhonen says.</P></DIV><P><mark>ABB</mark>’s technologies support energy production that is based on renewable energy sources, which the EU aims to increase to 50% by 2050. Already wind, biomass, solar and hydropower are growing rapidly and replacing coal more and more. Energy is mainly still produced in large units, and the cash flow runs from the consumer to the producer. However, decentralised energy production will change this pattern: when a lot of the energy in a network is supplied by small producers, both energy and cash flows will run in both directions.
“<mark>ABB</mark> has a great solution for this and it is smart grids. Fluctuating demand requires smart electric current to ensure a stable energy supply,” Muhonen explains.</P><P><mark>ABB</mark> is currently developing solutions for storing the extra electricity obtained from renewable energy sources; it is working on electric banks of accumulators for various needs. It has made the most progress with charging devices for electric cars and buses.
“For marine use, we have a hybrid ship in the pipeline that could carry batteries along at sea. The ship would be charged with shore-side electricity in the port, which would reduce its noise <mark>pollution</mark> and emissions,” says Muhonen.</P><P>In Finland, for example, one fifth of all the energy consumed is expended by transport of all kinds. Fortunately, <mark>ABB</mark>’s solutions can help to make transport more environmentally friendly.
“<mark>ABB</mark>’s Azipod® electric propulsion and energy management system, for example, reduces a vessel’s energy consumption by up to 20% and cuts <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions significantly,” Muhonen says. The energy consumption of trains can also be cut by up to 30% when their braking energy is converted into electricity to be utilised by the train.</P><DIV id=""attachment_190"" style=""max-width: 451px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Energy efficiency is the thread that runs through all of <mark>ABB</mark> planning. It makes the company a strong fighter against <mark>climate change</mark>.</P></DIV><P>Muhonen believes that it is possible to replace practically all the internal combustion engines in the world with electric motors. The consumption of electricity by industrial electric motors worldwide, currently 28%, could also be reduced significantly. Furthermore, there is enough renewable energy available to be utilised multifold, if increasing its use was not so slow. In Muhonen’s view, the crucial point is the development of battery technology, which will further advance a <mark>sustainable</mark> world.
“We must conserve some natural resources for future generations. Because nations are procreating at a fast rate, we have to follow the principles of <mark>sustainable</mark> development when designing and planning products and solutions. We have done well, but there is still a lot of work to be continued.

In particular, these sanctions – imposed by Barack Obama, supported by Hillary Clinton, and repeatedly questioned by Donald Trump and Rex Tillerson – are blocking a lucrative long-term oil agreement between Russia and ExxonMobil, a deal whose value is underscored by a little-noticed 1988 declassified <SPAN class=""caps"">CIA</SPAN> document.</P><P>As law enforcement and congressional investigations go forward, a key issue is whether there were pre-election discussions between the Putin and Trump camps involving the possible lifting of these sanctions, just as Russia was seeking to influence the election in Trump’s favor.</P><P>The apparent hook for Flynn’s multiple phone calls with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak was Obama’s December 29 imposition of new sanctions against Russia, penalties imposed in the wake of <SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> intelligence findings that Russia had aimed to tilt the election to Trump by hacking emails and spreading disinformation. Although transcripts of the calls from intelligence community intercepts have not been publicly released, the <EM>Washington Post</EM><A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/national-security-adviser-flynn-discussed-sanctions-with-russian-ambassador-despite-denials-officials-say/2017/02/09/f85b29d6-ee11-11e6-b4ff-ac2cf509efe5_story.html?utm_term=.349abfd3cadb"">reported</A> that some senior <SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> officials interpret Flynn’s words as signaling that Moscow could expect a lessening of the sanctions. Thereafter, Putin announced that Russia would not impose retaliatory sanctions, a decision that Trump then praised on Twitter.</P><P>But the scope of those December sanctions are small potatoes compared with other penalties already in place prior to the election: the <A href=""https://www.state.gov/e/eb/tfs/spi/ukrainerussia/"">2014 sanctions</A> that the <SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> imposed after Russia’s military annexation of Crimea and other abuses in Ukraine. Those sanctions penalize numerous companies and individuals in Putin’s inner circle, as well as key Russian banks and energy companies, and block U.S oil companies, including Exxon, from working on Russian oil and gas drilling joint ventures.
 </P><H3><STRONG>The Russia-Exxon Deal</STRONG></H3><P>Perhaps the biggest deal that the <SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> sanctions shut down was the remarkable 2011 <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/world/europe/rex-tillersons-company-exxon-has-billions-at-stake-over-russia-sanctions.html?_r=0"">agreement</A> that Putin and <mark>Rosneft</mark>, Russia’s state oil company, brokered with Exxon and its <SPAN class=""caps"">CEO</SPAN>, Rex Tillerson. The two sides called the agreement a “Strategic Partnership.” The plum in this <A href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/13/exxon-mobil-could-tap-huge-arctic-assets-if-us-russian-relations-thaw.html"">deal</A>, potentially worth hundreds of billions of dollars, was new exploration for offshore oil and gas in the Russian Arctic. (The drilling deal was facilitated by global warming that has <A href=""https://thinkprogress.org/exxon-makes-billion-dollar-bet-<mark>climate</mark>-change-is-real-here-now-and-going-to-get-worse-but-keeps-e5e31ddca18c#.odle3brkr"">melted Arctic ice</A>; some have asked whether Exxon was sharing with <mark>Rosneft</mark> its knowledge and modelling of accelerating <mark>climate change</mark>, even as it continued to <A href=""http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/global-warming/exxon-and-the-oil-industry-knew-about-<mark>climate</mark>-change/exxons-<mark>climate</mark>-denial-history-a-timeline/"">fund efforts to conceal</A> the risks of <mark>climate change</mark> from the American people.)</P><P>This deal is made even more interesting by a <A href=""https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000498653.pdf"">1988 <SPAN class=""caps"">CIA</SPAN> secret report</A>, since declassified, on the Kara Sea, the very location where Exxon and <mark>Rosneft</mark> were planning their major offshore operations. The Kara Sea, the <SPAN class=""caps"">CIA</SPAN> stated, “could become one of the major petroleum regions in the <SPAN class=""caps"">USSR</SPAN> early in the next century.” But the agency judged that development was unlikely without joint ventures with Western oil companies.</P><P>Twenty-three years later, Exxon stepped into the very role the <SPAN class=""caps"">CIA</SPAN> predicted.</P><P>Oil and gas revenue has accounted for upwards of 70 percent of Russia’s export income and <A href=""https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i8TRkfzZ_OKY/v2/-1x-1.png"">40 to 50 percent</A> of the Russian budget over the past decade. A glut of oil on the global market has crashed oil prices and tanked the Russian economy in the last few years. Nonetheless, Russia is now second to the United States in oil and gas production, and only the <SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> fracking boom of the past 5 years puts the U.S in the lead. And in brokering the Russian deal, Exxon promised to <A href=""http://business.financialpost.com/news/energy/exxon-fracking-siberia-to-help-putin-maintain-oil-clout"">teach <mark>Rosneft</mark> to frack</A>, with made-in-America technology and equipment.</P><P>The Russian Arctic alone is said to hold upwards of 90 billion barrels of oil. And <mark>Rosneft</mark> has exclusive access, granted by Putin. The <mark>Rosneft</mark> deal was also <A href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/13/exxon-mobil-could-tap-huge-arctic-assets-if-us-russian-relations-thaw.html"">crucial for Exxon’s future</A>, allowing it to book massive reserves unavailable elsewhere on earth, before the sanctions shut it all down.  </P><P>One might ask how allowing this deal to proceed would help the United States anywhere except at Exxon headquarters. But the deal has the potential to make Russia great again.  
 </P><H3><STRONG>Trump and the Russia Sanctions</STRONG></H3><P>Now Putin and Exxon have a potential savior in Donald Trump. Candidate Trump promised in July that he “<A href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/trump-crimea-sanctions-russia-226292"">would be looking into</A>” recognizing Crimea as part of Russia and lifting the Obama sanctions. A few days later Trump <A href=""http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/trump-crimeas-people-prefer-russia-elected-putin-ukraine/story?id=41029437"">told an interviewer</A> that “the people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia.”</P><P>Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, had <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/06/hillary-clinton-says-vladimir-putins-crimea-occupation-echoes-hitler"">compared Putin’s intervention</A> in Crimea to Adolph Hitler’s aggression and called for maintaining and indeed strengthening <SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> sanctions against Moscow.</P><P>On January 16, president-elect Trump returned to the subject, saying he might propose a deal under which the <SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> would end its Crimea sanctions if Russia agreed to a nuclear arms agreement. “Russia’s hurting very badly right now because of sanctions,” <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-arms-deal-idUSKBN14Z0YE"">Trump said</A>, “but I think something can happen that a lot of people are gonna benefit.”</P><P>Buttressing the idea that Trump has been preparing to lift the Russia sanctions was his choice for secretary of state: Rex Tillerson, who had no diplomatic or government experience but who spent 41 years at Exxon. In pursuing the arctic drilling deal, Tillerson developed <A href=""https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/reports/2016/12/21/295592/moscow-on-the-potomac/"">strong personal ties</A> to <mark>Rosneft</mark> head Igor Sechin, an ex-<SPAN class=""caps"">KGB</SPAN> agent close to Putin. In 2012, Russia awarded Tillerson one of its highest honors, the Order of Friendship decoration. Despite Tillerson’s <A href=""http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/11/14237748/tillerson-exxon-russia-lobbying"">denials</A> at his confirmation hearing, <A href=""http://disclosures.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2014/Q2/300667995.xml"">Exxon lobbied</A> against Obama’s 2014 <A href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/exxon-mobile-russia-sanctions-rex-tillerson-232770"">sanctions</A>, which included penalties on <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/28/<mark>rosneft</mark>-chairman-us-sanctions-bp"">Sechin personally</A>. Tillerson thereafter told his shareholders that Exxon generally <A href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rex-tillerson-trumps-pick-secretary-state/story?id=44112481"">opposed</A><SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> sanctions as ineffective. (Tillerson’s former colleagues at Exxon will now also benefit from a <A href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/davidhalperin/trump-tillerson-exxon-ame_b_14575170.html"">range of Trump policies</A> that favor oil and gas interests.)</P><P>Now there is evidence that Trump associates from outside the administration have been actively pushing the White House to end the sanctions. On Sunday, the <EM>New York Times </EM><A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/us/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-russia.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news"">reported</A> that Michael Cohen, Donald Trump’s long-time personal lawyer at the Trump organization, hand-delivered to Flynn, the week before he resigned, a proposal for a Russia-Ukraine peace deal that includes lifting the <SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> sanctions. The plan was endorsed by Cohen, Felix Sater, a Russian-American businessman with longstanding connections to Trump, and a Ukrainian opposition politician.</P><P>To be sure, there are <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/why-putin-wants-a-trump-victory-so-much-he-might-even-be-trying-to-help-him/2016/08/17/897ab21c-6495-11e6-be4e-23fc4d4d12b4_story.html?utm_term=.7cd547e3cf6f"">reasons</A> besides the sanctions that Putin might have wanted to help Trump win: Trump lacked Hillary Clinton’s national security and government experience and thus was potentially a weaker adversary; Trump was calling into question <SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> alliances and commitments overseas, including <SPAN class=""caps"">NATO</SPAN>; and Trump repeatedly expressed personal admiration for Putin.</P><P>But the chance to rescue the flagging Russian economy certainly would have loomed large for the Kremlin leader.</P><H3><STRONG>The Trump Camp’s Russia Ties</STRONG></H3><P>Meanwhile, Trump not only was the potential beneficiary of this aggressive Russian interference in the <SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> election; he actively cheered it on during the campaign, endlessly praising the leaking of Democrats’ emails, quoting from those messages, and calling on Russia to hack into Hillary Clinton’s server to “find the 30,000 emails that are missing.”</P><P>There is plenty of evidence of engagement between the Trump camp and Russia. Flynn, who was Trump’s campaign advisor before briefly serving as his White House national security adviser, has <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/mike-flynn-resign-pence-russia.html"">significant ties to Russian interests</A>, as do Trump advisers <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/politics/trump-russia-associates-investigation.html"">Paul Manafort, Carter Page, and Roger Stone</A>. (The <A href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3259984-Trump-Intelligence-Allegations.html"">intelligence dossier</A> created by ex-<SPAN class=""caps"">MI6</SPAN> agent Christopher Steele includes the unconfirmed allegation that <A href=""http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/02/14/donald-trumps-russia-scandal-is-just-getting-started/"">Page met over the summer</A> with <mark>Rosneft</mark>’s president Sechin and a senior Russian government official and that “Sechin's associate said that the <mark>Rosneft</mark> president was so keen to lift personal and corporate western sanctions imposed on the company, that he offered Page and his associates the brokerage of up to a 19 per cent (privatised) stake in <mark>Rosneft</mark>. In return, Page had expressed interest and confirmed that were Trump elected <SPAN class=""caps"">US</SPAN> president, then sanctions on Russia would be lifted.”)</P><P>Reuters <A href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-cyber-idUSKBN15X0OE"">reported</A> over the weekend  that the <SPAN class=""caps"">FBI</SPAN> is examining “financial transactions by Russian individuals and companies who are believed to have links to Trump associates.” And the <EM>New York Times</EM><A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/russia-intelligence-communications-trump.html"">reported</A> last week that calls intercepted by <SPAN class=""caps"">U.S.</SPAN> intelligence calls show that Trump associates and campaign officials “had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election.” Meanwhile, two days after the election, the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei A. Ryabkov, <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/moscow-had-contacts-with-trump-team-during-campaign-russian-diplomat-says/2016/11/10/28fb82fa-a73d-11e6-9bd6-184ab22d218e_story.html?utm_term=.b928568f6e77"">said</A> “there were contacts” between Russian officials and Trump’s team during the campaign. “Obviously,” Ryabkov added, “we know most of the people from his entourage.” Obviously.</P><P>At his press conference on Thursday, Trump flatly denied that he had any financial connections to Russia, <A href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-business.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0"">despite</A> the <A href=""http://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/12/19/the-curious-world-of-donald-trumps-private-russian-connections/"">extensive evidence</A> that he does. He added that “nobody that I know of” from his campaign talked with Russian officials during the campaign. But as to whether <A href=""http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/02/who-told-flynn-to-call-russia-214782"">Flynn</A> discussed the sanctions with Kislyak in December, Trump said, “It would have been okay with me… I would have directed him if I thought he wasn’t doing it.”</P><P>Thus the signs of a possible arrangement: The Trump and Putin camps are acquainted. Putin helps Trump become president. Trump ends the sanctions that are holding back Putin’s economy, especially the Exxon-<mark>Rosneft</mark> deal. That the two men seem to share a love of autocratic government, of <A href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trumps-dangerous-attempts-to-undermine-reality/2017/02/16/f5d9b826-f3ca-11e6-b9c9-e83fce42fb61_story.html?utm_term=.d00aa16aaa61"">pressuring the media</A> and judiciary to do their bidding, and of mingling their <A href=""http://www.citizensforethics.org/press-release/crew-sues-trump-emoluments/"">financial interests</A> with their <A href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/vladimir-putin-corruption-five-things-we-learned-about-the-russian-presidents-secret-wealth-a6834171.html"">government power</A>, does not lessen concerns that such a corrupt deal has been taking place in front of our eyes.</P><P><EM>Kert Davies directs the <mark>Climate</mark> Investigations Center.

Moreover, the EU says, <mark>Gazprom</mark> abused its dominant market position to try to keep control of the Yamal transit pipeline across Poland, and to bully Bulgaria into supporting South Stream, a now-cancelled Kremlin project to bring gas across the Black Sea into the EU.</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> had put out feelers to Brussels in previous months to see if it could reach a settlement. But those talks broke down amid the freeze in East-West relations over Ukraine. Now <mark>Gazprom</mark> has 12 weeks to deal with the charges—by rebuttal, concessions or both. If it fails to satisfy the commission, the next stage is enforcement. This could mean fines of €1 billion ($1.1 billion) or more—in theory up to 10% of its turnover—and legally mandated changes to its business model. Such options are still in reserve. “All roads are open,” says Ms Vestager. “We would like <mark>Gazprom</mark> to answer and we would like to talk.”</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark>’s initial response was icy. It said the EU’s complaint was “unfounded”, insisted that it already abides by international law and the domestic legislation of the countries where it does business, and argued that the dispute should be settled at a governmental level. <mark>Gazprom</mark> was established “beyond the jurisdiction of the EU”, it noted. Revealingly, it said that Russian law gave it “special, socially significant functions…and the status of a strategic government-controlled business entity”. Back in 2012 President Vladimir Putin banned such “strategic” companies from disclosing information to foreign regulators or obeying their orders.</P><P>The EU began its move against <mark>Gazprom</mark> with the launch of the “Third Energy Package” in 2007. That was a deceptively bland title for a series of measures that “unbundled”—in fact, upended—Europe’s energy market. The main effect was to ban the same company from owning both the gas pipelines and the molecules that flow through them. Russia objected harshly to this, seeing it as a politicised, unprovoked and confiscatory attack on <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s assets and business model.</P><P>However, rather like Microsoft, which fell foul of EU competition law for bundling its Internet Explorer browser with its Windows operating system, the company and its political masters did not grasp the EU’s ferocious prosecutorial powers. And the more the EU looked at Russian gas imports, the less it liked what it saw. In 2011, in the biggest antitrust raid in the EU’s history, officials with search warrants seized documents and computers from dozens of offices belonging to <mark>Gazprom</mark> and its affiliates. In 2012 the EU followed this up by opening a formal investigation.</P><P>The statement of objections has been largely ready since 2013, but was subject to a long and timorous delay. Ms Vestager’s predecessor, Joaquín Almunia, repeatedly promised to launch charges, but left office in November with that pledge unfulfilled. Senior people in the commission thought a deal would be better than worsening relations with Russia.</P><P>Now Europe is in a more robust frame of mind. Ms Vestager, a steely Dane, insists that her directorate is part of the justice system and acts without fear or favour. The move against <mark>Gazprom</mark> came only a week after it launched a statement of objections against another corporate giant, Google.</P><P>For <mark>Gazprom</mark> the most petulant option would be to ignore the EU. That brings speedy penalties—and also potential lawsuits from customers who have been overcharged, notes Alan Riley, a British law professor. Another option is to mount legal challenges—including ones claiming abuse of property rights. Vaclav Bartuska, the Czech Republic’s energy envoy, forecasts a climbdown, masked by a showy but empty deal on future exports to China to show the Russian public that the Kremlin is punishing Europe for its impudence.</P><P>Russia may also press ahead with <A href=""http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21647939-hungary-and-greece-are-joining-turkey-new-route-russian-gas-twist-pipeline"" target=""_blank"">Turk Stream</A>, a Black Sea pipeline which would deliver gas just as far as the Turkey-Greece border, to avoid the EU rules that stymied South Stream. The Kremlin is wooing Greece to support the project, with a $5 billion sweetener. More such divide-and-rule tactics in Europe are likely: Russia’s pipelines export political influence even when they are still mere lines on a map.</P><P>But turning off the gas taps, to punish the EU, seems unlikely. Russia is losing market share in Europe already, and cannot afford to annoy its customers or endanger its $40 billion export revenues.</P><P class=""xhead"">A cold <mark>climate</mark></P><P>Worries about dependence on Russian gas have in any case diminished. Not only is the winter over but Europe is generally in better shape to withstand a Russian tantrum. It has improved storage, and built north-south gas links, so that a cut in shipments across, say, Ukraine, can be made up with other supplies. Lithuania, once wholly dependent on Russian gas, has built a terminal to import liquefied natural gas (LNG), gaining a swift price cut from <mark>Gazprom</mark>. This year America will start LNG exports, creating yet more supply options.</P><P>For Mr Putin, the commission’s move underlines the scale of Russia’s isolation. Trust and patience have ebbed, even in Germany. His friends are fewer in number. By using energy as a weapon, he has prompted defence and counter-attack. The bear is not as feared as it was.</P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1.0,2.0,Strongly Positive

At the UN in Geneva, he talked about a “hegemon imposing its will on others” and warned America about a “Thucydides trap”—the disaster that befell ancient Greece when the incumbent power, Sparta, failed to accommodate the rising one, Athens. In February Mr Xi told a conference on security in Beijing that China should “guide international society” towards a “more just and rational new world order”. Previously Mr Xi had ventured only that China should play a role in building such a world.</P><P class=""xhead"">Your consensus is nonsense</P><P>There was a time when America was urging China to step up its global game. In 2005 Robert Zoellick, then America’s deputy secretary of state, urged China to become a “responsible stakeholder” in the international system. But nothing much happened. After the financial crisis of 2008 there was excited talk in China and the West about a “China model” or “Beijing consensus”. This was supposedly an alternative to the so-called Washington consensus, a prescription of free-market economic policies for developing countries. But those who promoted a China model did not say that it should be adopted by other countries, only that it was right to reject what they saw as a one-size-fits-all Washington consensus. Is there more to it this time? Is China challenging America for global leadership?</P><P>To answer that, it is important to begin with the way China’s political system works. Policies rarely emerge fully formed in a presidential speech. Officials often prefer to send subtle signals about intended changes, in a way that gives the government room to retreat should the new approach fail. The signals are amplified by similar ones further down the system and fleshed out by controlled discussions in state-owned media. In the realm of foreign policy, all that is happening now.</P><P>Soon after Mr Xi’s comments in Davos and Beijing, the prime minister, Li Keqiang, gave his annual “work report”—a sort of state-of-the-nation speech. It included an unusually long passage about foreign policy and mentioned <EM class=""Italic"">quanqiu</EM> (meaning global) or <EM class=""Italic"">quanqiuhua </EM>(globalisation) 13 times. That compares with only five such mentions last year (see chart).</P><P>As is their wont, state-run media have distilled the new thinking into numerical mnemonics. They refer enthusiastically to Mr Xi’s remarks on globalisation and a new world order as the “two guides”. And they have begun to discuss the makings of an idea that, unlike the old one of a China model, the country would like to sell to others. This is the so-called “China solution”. The phrase was first mentioned last July, on the 95th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. Mr Xi’s celebratory speech asserted that the Chinese people were “fully confident that they can provide a China solution to humanity’s search for better social institutions”. The term has gone viral. Baidu, China’s most popular search engine, counts 22m usages of its Chinese rendering: <EM class=""Italic"">Zhongguo fang’an</EM>.</P><P>No one has defined what the China solution is. But, whatever it means, there is one for everything. Strengthening global government? There is a China solution to that, said the <EM class=""Italic"">People’s Daily</EM>, the party’s main mouthpiece, in mid-March. <mark>Climate change</mark>? “The next step is for us to bring China’s own solution,” said Xie Zhenhua, the government’s special <mark>climate</mark> envoy, in another newspaper, <EM class=""Italic"">Southern Metropolis</EM>. There is even a China solution to the problem of bolstering the rule of law, claimed an article in January in <EM class=""Italic"">Study Times</EM>, a weekly for officials. Multi-billion-dollar investments in infrastructure in Central Asia are China’s solution to poverty and instability there. And so on. Unlike the China model, which its boosters said was aimed at developing countries, the China solution, says David Kelly of China Policy, a consultancy, is for everyone—including Western countries.</P><P>This marks a change. Chinese leaders never praised the China model; its fans were mainly Chinese academics and the country’s cheerleaders in the West. (Long before the term became fashionable, Deng advised the president of Ghana: “Do not follow the China model.”) Most officials were wary of it because the term could be interpreted as China laying down the law to others, contradicting its policy of not interfering in other countries’ internal affairs. In contrast, it was Mr Xi himself who broached the idea of the China solution. His prime minister included it in his work report. China now seems more relaxed about bossing others around.</P><P>This reflects not only the determination of the leadership to play a bigger role, but a growing confidence that China can do it. China’s self-assurance has been bolstered by what it sees as recent foreign-policy successes. Last year an international tribunal ruled against China’s claims to sovereignty in much of the South China Sea. But China promptly persuaded the Philippines, which had brought the case, implicitly to disavow its legal victory, eschew its once-close ties with America and sign a deal accepting vast quantities of Chinese investment. Soon after that Malaysia, another hitherto America-leaning country with maritime claims overlapping those of China, came to a similar arrangement. China’s leaders concluded that, despite the tribunal’s ruling, 2016 had been a good year for them in the South China Sea.</P><P>It was certainly a notable one for Mr Xi’s most ambitious foreign policy, called the “Belt and Road Initiative”. The scheme involves infrastructure investment along the old Silk Road between China and Europe. The value of contracts signed under the scheme came within a whisker of $1trn last year—not bad for something that only started in 2013. Chinese exports to the 60-odd Belt and Road countries overtook those to America and the European Union. In May Mr Xi is due to convene a grand summit of the countries to celebrate and advertise a project that could one day rival transatlantic trade in importance.</P><P>But talk of “guiding globalisation” and a “China solution” does not mean China is turning its back on the existing global order or challenging American leadership of it across the board. China is a revisionist power, wanting to expand influence within the system. It is neither a revolutionary power bent on overthrowing things, nor a usurper, intent on grabbing global control.</P><P>China is the third-largest donor to the UN’s budget after America and Japan (see chart) and is the second-largest contributor, after America, to the UN’s peacekeeping. Last year China chaired a summit of the Group of 20 largest economies—it has an above-average record of complying with the G20’s decisions. Recently it has stepped up its multilateral commitments. In 2015 it secured the adoption of the yuan as one of the IMF’s five reserve currencies. It has set up two financial institutions, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the New Development Bank, which are modelled on traditional ones such as the World Bank. Global rules on trade and finance, it seems, are too important for Mr Xi not to defend.</P><P>China is becoming a more active participant in the UN, but it is not trying to dominate it. It reacts to, rather than initiates, sanctions policy towards North Korea. And despite its own extensive anti-terrorist operations at home, it shows little interest in joining, let alone leading, operations against Islamic State.</P><P>There are domestic constraints on Mr Xi’s ambitions. China’s vast bureaucracy is resistant to change in foreign policy, as in everything else. During a recent trip to Australia the foreign minister, Wang Yi, said China had “no intention of leading anybody”. He was not contradicting Mr Xi, but neither was he echoing the president’s desire to guide a new world order. Ding Yifang of the Institute of World Development, a think-tank in Beijing, is similarly cautious about the China solution. “We don’t have universal ideals,” he says. “We are not that ambitious.”</P><P class=""xhead"">Globalism with Chinese characteristics</P><P>So what might China’s unassuming new assertiveness mean in practice? A template can be found in <mark>climate</mark>-change policy. China was one of the main obstacles to a global <mark>climate</mark> agreement in 2008, but now its words are the lingua franca of <mark>climate</mark>-related diplomacy. Parts of a deal on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions between Mr Xi and Barack Obama were incorporated wholesale into the Paris <mark>climate</mark> treaty of 2016. China helped determine how that accord defines what are known as “common and differentiated responsibilities”, namely how much each country should be responsible for cutting emissions.</P><P>As chairman of the G20 last year, Mr Xi made the fight against <mark>climate change</mark> a priority for the group. But China’s clout at that time was bolstered by its accord with America. Now Mr Trump is beginning to dismantle his predecessor’s <mark>climate</mark> policies. Li Shou of Greenpeace says China is therefore preparing to go it alone as Mr Xie, the <mark>climate</mark> envoy, said in January that it was prepared to do. It may be that a “China solution” to <mark>climate change</mark> will be the first practical application of the term.</P><P>Soon after Mr Xi’s speech in Davos, Zhang Jun, a senior Foreign Ministry official, put his finger on China’s changing place in the world. “I would say it is not China rushing to the front,” he told a newspaper in Hong Kong, “but rather the front-runners have stepped back, leaving the place to China.” But officials have far fewer qualms than Deng did about being at the front. “If China is required to play a leadership role,” says Mr Zhang, “it will assume its responsibilities.”</P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><FOOTER itemprop=""publication"" class=""blog-post__foot-note"">This article appeared in the<SPAN itemprop=""articleSection"">China</SPAN>section of the print edition under the headline<SPAN>&quot;Tortoise v hare&quot;</SPAN></FOOTER></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1.0,0.0,

The campaign group is particularly critical of BP's ongoing sponsorship of the British Museum in the UK.</P><P>The documents reveal what Culture Unstained calls the &quot;close working relationship between UK government and BP over Russia&quot; despite the fact that the material &quot;suggests that BP is attempting to bypass sanctions preventing shale drilling in Russia.&quot;</P><P>The British Government's hypocrisy is evident in the fact that despite taking a strong public line on Russia, the UK government has been helping BP water down U.S. sanctions and hosting events to boost UK ties with Russian oil and gas sector.</P><P>Over a period of several months, the documents outline how BP had numerous meetings with British government ministers and embassy staff, with British Ministers repeatedly offering support for BP's business in Russia.</P><P style="""">For example, in February 2017, the British Embassy in Russia hosted a <EM>Seminar on Vocation and Professional Education in the Oil and Gas Sector</EM>. It was designed to strengthen collaboration on &quot;UK and Russia education companies, schools and universities in one of the key industries—oil and gas.&quot; The president of BP Russia, David Campbell, gave the opening remarks at the event.</P><P style="""">Two months later, the Department for International Trade hosted a workshop on &quot;How to break into the Russian Oil &amp; Gas Sector.&quot; It highlighted that &quot;maintaining oil &amp; gas production requires large scale use of new technologies, which largely are not restricted by sanctions, and offered 'presentations by legal advisors about sanctions.'&quot;</P><P>Meanwhile, in June 2017, when new U.S. Sanctions on Russia were being proposed, BP and other oil companies started mobilizing against the U.S. bill. Within days, the British Embassy in Russia emailed BP to discuss &quot;what this could mean for UK interests.&quot; Of particular concern was BP's 19.75 percent stake in Russian state oil company, <mark>Rosneft</mark>.</P><P>That same month, in a meeting with the British trade minister, Greg Hands, in June 2017, the documents suggest BP appears to have been attempting to work around sanctions to gain approval for an unconventional shale oil project.</P><P>BP was waiting for a license that &quot;In the company's view … turns on the definition of shale.&quot; EU sanctions had aimed to prevent European companies helping Russian companies extract unconventional oil, by ruling out oil &quot;located in shale formations by way of hydraulic fracturing.&quot;</P><P>Within months, according to Culture Unstained, BP's lobbying effort against U.S. sanctions &quot;seems to have been successful.&quot;</P><P>On Aug. 2, BP CEO Bob Dudley <A href=""https://www.ft.com/content/6ffe1ebc-782d-11e7-90c0-90a9d1bc9691"" target=""_blank"">told market analysts</A> that the original draft of the sanctions bill had been full of &quot;'very significant unintended consequences' but now the company was not &quot;aware of any material adverse effect on our current income and investment in Russia or elsewhere, or our ability to work with <mark>Rosneft</mark> itself&quot;.</P><P>Chris Garrard, Co-director of Culture Unstained, argues that, &quot;BP is turning massive profits in Russia by partnering with <mark>Rosneft</mark>, a company responsible for record numbers of oil spills, turning a blind eye to corruption and cozying up to Putin's notorious 'right-hand man.' But instead of holding BP to account, the UK government seems willing to help the company sidestep sanctions while the British Museum launders its brand.&quot;</P><P>Meanwhile yesterday afternoon, activists from the group, BP or not BP? dropped an eleven-metre floor-to-balcony banner refelcting the 2,727 oil spills caused by BP's Russian partner, <mark>Rosneft</mark>, in a single region in just one year in the British Museum.</P><P>Performers then showered thousands of paper &quot;oil drops&quot; from balcony in the iconic Great Court to protest against the final day of the BP-sponsored Scythians exhibition, held in partnership with the Russian State Hermitage Museum.</P><P style="""">&quot;BP is deeply embedded in this Russian oil giant, which is well-known as one of the most corrupt and polluting in the world,&quot;  said <A href=""https://bp-or-not-bp.org/2018/01/14/we-drop-huge-banner-and-thousands-of-oil-drops-in-bp-sponsored-british-museum/"" target=""_blank"">Helen Glynn</A>, who took part in the performance. &quot;So why has the British Museum allowed BP to sponsor an exhibition of artefacts from the very regions and cultures that the company is putting at risk?&quot;</P><P>&quot;This week, the <A href=""https://www.ecowatch.com/new-york-fossil-fuel-divestment-2524494059.html"">New York</A> Mayor announced that the city is suing BP and four other oil companies for the <mark>climate change</mark> damage they have caused,&quot; she said. &quot;The British Museum faces huge repetitional risks by continuing to promote and defend a company so toxic that one of the world's richest cities has now turned against it.&quot;</P><P style=""""><EM>Reposted with permission from our media associate </EM><EM><A href=""http://priceofoil.org/2018/01/15/bp-accused-of-side-stepping-russian-sanctions/"" target=""_blank"">Oil Change International</A>.</EM></P><DIV class=""around-the-web""><DIV class=""around-the-web__headline"">Related Articles Around the Web</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1.0,1.0,Negative

The pipeline ends at the Marcus Hook facility south of Philadelphia, where massive &quot;dragon ships&quot; owned by <mark>Ineos</mark> carry gas liquids to Norway and Scotland.</P><P>&quot;Fracking is creating a public health and <mark>climate</mark> disaster while propping the highly polluting plastics industry,&quot; said <A href=""http://www.ecowatch.com/community/wenonah_hauter/"">Wenonah Hauter</A>, executive director of Food &amp; Water Watch.</P><P>&quot;People on both sides of the Atlantic are suffering the costs, with extremely detrimental effects to our global environment—everything from air <mark>pollution</mark> and <mark>climate</mark> altering emissions to the proliferation of <A href=""http://www.ecowatch.com/tag/plastic-<mark>pollution</mark>"">plastic waste</A> can be tied to the companies benefiting from this poisonous process.&quot;</P><P>Shipping gas liquids to Europe will drive more fracking in Pennsylvania, with all the accompanying water and air <mark>pollution</mark> that has been well-documented over the last several years of drilling in the state. That drilling is the rationale behind the Mariner East 2. Though the project has been approved by state regulators, communities along the 350-mile route are fighting against the pipeline's construction through a mix of municipally-oriented strategies and nonviolent direct action tactics.</P><P>&quot;Sunoco Logistics, aka Energy Transfer Partners, continues to insist that it is providing a 'public benefit,' while in fact it is simply lining its pockets at the expense of the environment,&quot; said Ellen Gerhart, a Huntingdon County resident who has been resisting Sunoco's pipeline construction on her land.</P><P>&quot;We, as landowners facing eminent domain by this company, will continue to resist, and stand in solidarity with our friends in both the U.S. and Europe. The fight is not over.&quot;</P><P>The environmental hazards will be evident across the Atlantic, too. In Scotland, <mark>Ineos</mark> will be &quot;cracking&quot; the ethane to make ethylene, an industrial process that causes air <mark>pollution</mark> and creates additional plastic litter, like the small pellets called nurdles that are littering shorelines across the UK. Earlier this month, the <mark>Ineos</mark> petrochemical facility in Grangemouth, Scotland had a substantial ethylene leak that forced the evacuation of employees.</P><P>All of the companies involved in the trans-Atlantic pipeline, the report shows, have poor environmental records. The Grangemouth facility has been repeatedly cited by Scottish authorities for emissions and <mark>pollution</mark>s violations, along with workplace safety violations. One of the drilling companies in Pennsylvania, Range Resources—perhaps best known for a water contamination incident in Texas—has been fined almost $21 million by state regulators. The company has been charged with more than 500 health and safety violations between 2005 and 2016.</P><P>And Sunoco, according to one analysis, had a higher rate of oil spills than any of its competitors in the U.S. It recently completed a merger with Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the highly controversial <A href=""http://www.ecowatch.com/tag/dakota-access-pipeline"">Dakota Access pipeline</A>.</P><P>Food &amp; Water Watch offers several recommendations to communities and political leaders both sides of the Atlantic, starting with a complete ban on fracking everywhere, a ban on fossil fuel imports and ending fossil fuel infrastructure projects that are harming the environment and contributing to the mounting threats posed by <A href=""http://www.ecowatch.com/<mark>climate</mark>-change/""><mark>climate change</mark></A>.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""sPost_0_4_0_0_0_1_1_0_0_0_1_0_1"" class=""post-partial article__comments""><DIV class=""article-content__comments-wrapper""><DIV class=""action-btn js-toggle js--active"" data-target=""#comments-widget"" data-toggle-class=""hidden"">Show Comments (</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,2.0,Strongly Negative

More than 7,000 full-time workers a day pass through Toyota's largest assembly plant outside of Japan, a sprawling 7.5-million-square-foot space in the rolling hills of central Kentucky horse country.</P><P>Coils of rolled steel are stamped into a Camry or an Avalon. Robots and people work side by side to weld parts into a body, before the car is loaded onto a conveyor belt and off to the paint room. This fall, the plant will start producing Toyota's luxury brand Lexus.</P><P>Put it all together, and you have a major consumer of electricity in a state where there's really only one source: coal-fired generation. When the plant opened in the 1980s, Kentucky was a cheap place to let a machine run all weekend. Workers did just that.</P><P>&quot;People were afraid to turn something off,&quot; Butt said. &quot;It's the human element, the culture. We're still working through it, making sure we're turning something off.&quot;</P><P>The discussion about electricity use continues to change at the Georgetown assembly plant. Managers say their attitude falls under the Japanese principle called <EM>kaizen</EM>, or &quot;continuous improvement.&quot; Adopting more efficient ways of using power and considering their effect on Toyota's competitiveness in North America and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions put <EM>kaizen</EM> to the test.</P><P>But today there's an additional challenge, and that's the rising cost of purchasing power from electric utilities in Kentucky and across the Midwest. Regulated electricity rates are outside of the control of Toyota employees, even as they preach careful energy management. Also outside of their control are proposed federal regulations aiming to cut power-sector <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions tied to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><ASIDE id=""image_asset_layout_9654"" class=""left span10 image_asset_layout""><P class=""caption"">At Toyota’s auto assembly plant in Georgetown, Ky., plant managers expect energy costs to go up as electric utilities retool.  <SPAN class=""credit"">Photo by Joel Kirkland.</SPAN></P></ASIDE><P>The cost of transitioning to cleaner fuels is going up in states where old, centralized power plants rely heavily on high-<mark>carbon</mark> coal. Coal generates about 90 percent of Kentucky's power.</P><P>PPL Corp.'s Kentucky Utilities, which serves Georgetown and southern Scott County around it, requested a 9.6 percent rate increase from the Public Service Commission in November. The $153 million revenue boost would help the utility handle rising capital costs.</P><P>Utility CEO Victor Staffieri cited $5.4 billion in capital costs through 2019, including firing up a natural gas generation unit and increasing capacity at a hydroelectric plant along the Ohio River that's operated by Louisville Gas &amp; Electric. LG&amp;E and KU are jointly run under the PPL umbrella of investor-owned utilities.</P><P>&quot;We all realize that the cost of energy is going to increase dramatically over time,&quot; Butt said in an interview in his quiet office a few hallways down from the busy assembly floor. &quot;That's a risk for this company.&quot;</P><H3>A nod for manufacturing</H3><SECTION class=""ad medium""><P class=""label"">Advertisement</P></SECTION><P>During visits to Washington, D.C., Kentucky officials are eager to point out that the state's manufacturers could be badly hurt by U.S. EPA's proposed Clean Power Plan. The state's industrial sector benefits from some of the lowest overall energy costs east of the Mississippi River, they've told EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy.</P><P>Those costs are going up as utilities replace old coal plants with cleaner power sources.</P><P>Kentucky has 220,000 people working in manufacturing. That spans energy-intensive aluminum smelters and the tens of thousands going to work at auto part factories or assembly plants.</P><P>The industrial sector is smaller than in Rust Belt states to the north and east, but the job numbers dwarf those employed in Kentucky coal mining. Even so, saving coal jobs has been the sole focus of a well-financed effort by Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and coal industry allies looking to kill President Obama's <mark>climate</mark> plan.</P><P>&quot;So you tell me what this is going to be about. It really is about manufacturing,&quot; Kentucky Energy and Environment Secretary Leonard Peters told <EM>EnergyWire</EM> last month, when asked about the focus of a highly charged statewide debate here about the costs of regulating <mark>carbon</mark>.</P><P>One of the ways to offset rising electricity costs is to use less of the commodity: Turn the lights out. Power down industrial widgets. Install rooftop solar panels that eliminate fuel costs. But Kentucky joins other states in wrestling with how exactly to incentivize electric utilities and industrial customers to work together on programs to control consumption better before costs start rising quickly.</P><P>For Toyota and other corners of the state's expanding auto industry, energy consumption can be tweaked by employing new and better technology for building cars. At a smelter or a cement factory, there's little wiggle room when so much of its raw material is the energy itself.</P><P>&quot;In Kentucky, while there's been some progress and some increased investment, as a whole it's not one of the leaders in energy efficiency,&quot; said Jill Tauber, a managing attorney for Earthjustice.</P><P>Kentucky tends to eat up more energy per unit of economic activity than other states. The industrial sector here has one of the highest energy intensity rates in the nation, according to the U.S. Energy Department, and it consumes about 45 percent of the state's total energy demand.</P><P>The Public Service Commission in Kentucky doesn't have the authority to mandate that utilities encourage residential, commercial and industrial customers to use less power. But the commission continues to bring it up in rate cases, and it's pressing the large investor-owned utilities and rural co-ops to study ways to incentivize industrial users to save energy.</P><P>Regulators here are pitching efficiency as a tool for navigating -- or surviving -- rapid changes in the power sector.</P><P>&quot;The commission continues to believe that conservation, energy efficiency and demand-side management, generally, will become increasingly important as more constraints are likely to be placed upon utilities whose main source of supply is coal-based generation,&quot; the commission said in a Jan. 16 order that grants a 2.4 percent rate increase to Cumberland Valley Electric.</P><P>The commission is pushing utilities to take more aggressive measures through what's called demand-side management, or DSM. That refers to the variety of programs and financial incentives that utilities can use to control how much energy big customers use during peak hours.</P><H3>'Lowest-<mark>carbon</mark> kilowatt'</H3><P>For utilities, the economic benefit of selling less of their product to big customers isn't obvious unless they can recover the cost of doing so through regulated rates. But efficiency is on the shortlist of tools states can use to comply with federal targets for cutting <mark>carbon</mark> emissions.</P><P>&quot;The lowest-<mark>carbon</mark> kilowatt is still the one you don't use,&quot; said Gale Boyd, an economist and director of the Triangle Research Data Center at Duke University.</P><P>&quot;That's going to require a partnership with management, and for companies to let their energy suppliers into their plants,&quot; he said. &quot;It's what successful utilities are going to do with respect to their industrial load.&quot;</P><P>In November, the commission approved an efficiency plan with plenty of cost-recovery for LG&amp;E and Kentucky Utilities through 2018. That includes energy profiles for high-consuming residential customers; the use of &quot;switches&quot; to cycle down air conditioning, heat pumps and equipment during peak hours; low-income weatherization programs; and $150 to $1,000 incentives for multi-family houses to change their consumption habits.</P><P>LG&amp;E and KU proposed a voluntary advanced metering program for a limited number of customers.</P><P>But in rolling out its plan, the utilities ran into trouble when they presented a study on what more can be done to boost energy efficiency. The study didn't include the industrial sector.</P><P>Sierra Club jumped in and asked the commission to direct the companies to study what industrial customers can do.</P><P>The PSC described the utilities' concern this way: If large energy consumers such as Toyota opted out of an industrial demand-side management and efficiency program, costs for everyone else would go up. It described a domino effect that would lead other industrial customers to opt out.</P><P>The utilities also pointed to a lack of interest in energy efficiency programs among big industrial customers, according to a 2012 survey they conducted.</P><P>&quot;The companies presented no evidence, except for the 2012 survey, to support its contention that there is no wide-scale interest in industrial DSM/EE programs,&quot; the PSC said in its November order.</P><P>The PSC ordered the utilities to commission a study of potential industrial energy efficiency.</P><H3>Cumberland rates</H3><P>States that burn a lot of cheap coal have held down regulated electricity rates for decades. Yet in a number of those states, including Kentucky, the monthly residential electric bills that land in customer mailboxes are higher than in states with more aggressive efficiency programs.</P><P>In Kentucky, West Virginia, Indiana, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina and Louisiana, average monthly residential electric bills are between $105 and $135 a month, according to 2012 data compiled by Fitch Ratings.</P><P>In California and Colorado, where rates are higher but state policies incentivize utilities to encourage energy savings, the average monthly bill was between $80 and $87.</P><P>EPA <mark>carbon</mark> regulations are expected to be finalized this summer. The transition to a power system that is ultimately cheaper and more manageable for consumers means big capital costs for utilities on the front end of what's expected to be a multi-decade process.</P><P>In the Cumberland Valley rate case in January, the PSC acknowledged that there's a need for utilities operating in poor regional economies to &quot;guard against&quot; the revenue erosion that happens when customers and sales decline. Cumberland Valley distributes power to customers across the southeastern part of Kentucky, where the population and local economies are declining. That puts both the utility and state regulators in a tough spot.</P><P>Electricity demand has remained relatively flat in recent years. And burning loads of coal to produce and sell as much electricity as possible isn't the fail-safe business model it used to be. Natural gas is priced competitively with coal, and the cost of supplementing baseload generation with zero-<mark>carbon</mark> sources such as wind and solar is coming down fast.</P><P>In Midwestern states on Kentucky's doorstep, electric transmission infrastructure is an emerging cost. In states less coal-dependent than Kentucky, interstate lines meant to build out the regional grid to tap wind power from the Great Plains and to integrate utility-scale solar power are being factored into discussions about cost control.</P><P>Back in Georgetown, Toyota has decided to take some of this into its own hands.</P><P>This spring, the plant expects to start converting methane from a local landfill into 1 megawatt of electricity, and increasing power production from there. Starting out, it's enough to power the production of about 10,000 cars.</P><P>In the meantime, Butt, the environmental manager at Toyota, says the system of capturing methane cuts about 90 percent of the landfill's greenhouse gas emissions and helps the region meet ambient air quality standards.</P><P>&quot;We'll always be on a major grid of some sort,&quot; Butt said.</P><P>Increasingly, however, there's some choice in the matter. &quot;How do we step out from where we're currently at and evaluate the next pieces of technology we could use here?&quot; Butt asked.</P><P>Toyota is looking for opportunities to couple investments in energy-cost savings and emissions reductions, he said. But he acknowledged that the goal is harder to meet for industrial plants in states like Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana, where utilities remain locked into burning coal for most of their power.</P><P>&quot;If you look at our manufacturing plant in Toronto, Canada, which is all hydropower, we don't look so good,&quot; Butt said, by comparison to the Georgetown plant's <mark>carbon</mark> footprint.</P></SECTION><SECTION class=""promo_container trial_promo""><H1>Like what you see?</H1><H2 class=""bottom_1 global_red"">Start a free trial now.</H2><P class=""bottom_1"">Get access to our comprehensive, daily coverage of energy and environmental politics and policy.</P></SECTION></SECTION></ARTICLE></SECTION></BODY></HTML>",1.0,1.0,Positive

Others, however, contend that the conversation on <mark>climate</mark> has shifted away from hard-liners, with a growing number of Republicans and conservatives embracing clean technology and <mark>climate</mark> science, according to several of the group's members.</P><P>&quot;I think the attention they got on energy and environmental issues was so intense that that's where they focused on their outreach with the center-left,&quot; said Paul Blair, director of strategic initiatives with Americans for Tax Reform and a member of ALEC. &quot;You can't pass the laugh test with going center-left on tax issues. To me, you can't pass the laugh test with me by going center-left on energy and environment issues. But they apparently think they can.&quot;</P><P>It's a fight that reflects the broader conservative debate over <mark>climate change</mark> and the direction of the Republican Party during the Trump administration.</P><P>And it will soon come to a head, as ALEC members prepare to vote on a measure that takes aim at U.S. EPA's endangerment finding on greenhouse gases. The Obama-era finding is a compilation of scientific evidence that forms the legal basis for EPA greenhouse gas regulations. It's despised by many conservatives.</P><SECTION class=""ad medium""><P class=""label"">Advertisement</P></SECTION><P>ALEC's Energy, Environment and Agriculture Task Force is slated to vote on a draft <A href=""https://www.alec.org/model-policy/resolution-calling-for-epa-review-of-the-2009-endangerment-finding-for-greenhouse-gases/"">resolution</A> at a meeting in Nashville, Tenn., next month that calls &quot;upon the Environmental Protection Agency to withdraw the 2009 endangerment finding for <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and other greenhouse gases and conduct a new rulemaking on this issue.&quot;</P><P>If ALEC ultimately adopts the resolution, it will serve as a model resolution for state and federal lawmakers to express their disdain for the EPA finding. The vote will put big businesses and trade groups that sit on the ALEC task force on the spot regarding whether the endangerment finding is worth investigating.</P><P>&quot;Robust debate comes from stakeholders engaging from a variety of perspectives. And that is precisely what's happening here,&quot; said ALEC spokesman Bill Meierling. He noted that the draft resolution could be amended or changed when the task force meets in Nashville.</P><P>The tug of war at ALEC mirrors the fight between voices skeptical of mainstream <mark>climate</mark> science — like the nonprofit Heartland Institute — and groups that are more moderate on <mark>climate change</mark>, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</P><P>Heartland is rumored to be behind the endangerment resolution, with former North Dakota state Rep. Bette Grande (R) — who now freelances for Heartland and participates in ALEC matters — thought to have drafted it and handed off the language to a state lawmaker and ALEC member.</P><P>Heartland did not respond to a request for comment.</P><P>Heartland and its allies have pushed EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to take on the endangerment finding, which the EPA chief has been reluctant to pursue. Corporate America, meanwhile, largely supported staying in the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement and retaining the Clean Power Plan — an Obama administration rule to curb power plant emissions — but ultimately lost those battles to far-right groups, though some hope Trump will ultimately remain in the global <mark>climate</mark> pact.</P><H3>Bellwether moment?</H3><P>The endangerment finding vote may serve as a bellwether for where ALEC stands on <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Is ALEC part and parcel of a conservative movement that has questioned <mark>climate change</mark> and the policy responses to it? Or does it operate among the wider atmosphere of reputation-conscious corporations and even some moderates who have opposed the Trump administration on <mark>climate change</mark>?</P><P>But that calculation also belies a more fundamental point about ALEC — while it has a reputation as a far-right group advancing industry interests, it's also a member-driven organization. If ALEC is shifting on <mark>climate</mark> and energy, it's largely because its members have, too.</P><P>&quot;If there were some grand conspiracy, I'd know about it, and there isn't,&quot; said Eli Lehrer, president of the free-market think tank R Street Institute, which supports a <mark>carbon</mark> tax. &quot;To the extent things have changed, it's because opinions have changed.&quot;</P><P>At its core, ALEC is an organization about free markets and limited government. Thus, its members also have railed against and helped craft bills to roll back President Obama's <mark>climate</mark> and environmental measures, many of which were federal regulations, and local incentives for clean energy. At the same time, though, the group has come under fire for taking cash from fossil fuel companies threatened by the advance of clean energy while often neglecting to mention subsidies and incentives that legacy energy sources enjoy.</P><P>Longtime ALEC watchdogs view the endangerment finding draft resolution as an attempt by its conservative members to reorient the organization to its roots after several rudderless years on energy and environment matters. Part of that is a response to the Trump administration, said Nick Surgey, director of Documented, an organization that tracks the influence of corporations on public policy.</P><P>&quot;This is a reflection of an organization that has shifted itself more into the mainstream of <mark>climate change</mark> in terms of rhetoric in the last three to four years,&quot; Surgey said. &quot;Now they've got almost everything they want from Scott Pruitt and the EPA, and they have to justify their existence to their funders. And it seems like they're allying themselves with the more radical of the funders.&quot;</P><P>The cohesion between ALEC and the Trump administration is evident to ALEC CEO Lisa Nelson. She sent a congratulatory email to its members on Jan. 30 to celebrate the new administration, saying, &quot;This administration does have the potential to be an ALEC administration. It is full of the people and ideas we've advanced since 1973.&quot;</P><P>But conservatives familiar with ALEC said they're concerned that the organization has gravitated to satisfying interests that aren't committed to the free-market principles upon which the group was created. They said that dynamic is most apparent in the energy and environment space.</P><P>&quot;When it comes to the policies of the organization, ALEC does have strong positions on issues that are consistent with the free market,&quot; Blair said. &quot;The issue is if they are planning to upend those principles to fundraise in the future.&quot;</P><P>They worry that ALEC is trying to plug a funding gap following the high-profile exits of Google, BP PLC, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> PLC and others, all of which blamed the organization's stance on <mark>climate change</mark> for their departure. Those companies left largely over pressure from shareholders who were spurred into action after activist groups harped on ALEC funding streams. The conservative billionaire industrialist Koch brothers are big donors; Exxon Mobil Corp., a member of the Energy, Environment and Agriculture Task Force, is also a major funder.</P><H3>Conservatives revolt</H3><P>ALEC's conservative members saw warning signs recently when feathers were ruffled over what they said in the past would have been a fairly easy decision.</P><P>The energy task force couldn't agree to move on a resolution that opposed property assessed clean energy, or PACE — a financing mechanism to fund clean energy or energy efficiency upgrades. Conservatives were worried about exposing taxpayers to losses, since municipal bonds underwrote many of the projects.</P><P>But many of ALEC's members also have PACE interests. One conservative source said those groups backing PACE angled to kill the resolution and criticized ALEC for trying to appease such funders. Rockwood Group CEO Scott Zajac, whose investment firm operates in the PACE world, was particularly vocal in opposing the resolution within ALEC, the source said.</P><P>Others, though, noted that's just how the energy space is these days — corporations are on board with clean energy. Rejecting mainstream <mark>climate</mark> science or trying to stymie growth of energy sources that compete with ALEC's old guard of coal, natural gas and oil companies doesn't fly anymore.</P><P>The PACE resolution foundered over much acrimony in ALEC's July meeting and was forbidden to ever return as a discussion point. That result has generated revolt from some of the more dogmatic conservatives.</P><P>&quot;I'm concerned that there has been an effort more recently to try and table what in the past would have been considered straightforward proposals based on free-market principles,&quot; said Tom Pyle, president of the conservative energy think tank Institute for Energy Research. &quot;That's what ALEC is supposed to be advancing.&quot;</P><P>That effort, though, is minor compared with the endangerment finding, which is a lightning rod in <mark>climate policy</mark> circles.</P><P>Publicly traded companies on the Energy, Environment and Agriculture Task Force are getting calls about the upcoming vote on the draft endangerment finding resolution, according to a source familiar with the situation.

Rather, he said, humanity's larger economic decisions are to blame.</P><SECTION class=""ad medium""><P class=""label"">Advertisement</P></SECTION><P>&quot;The IPCC does not say it's the extraction and production of oil that is driving these emissions,&quot; he said. &quot;It's economic activity that creates the demand for energy, and that leads to emissions.&quot;</P><P>The unusual five-hour hearing was required by Judge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, who is overseeing the cities' lawsuits seeking damages related to sea-level rise and other effects of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Earlier this month, Alsup asked the cities and oil companies to answer nine questions, including &quot;What are the main sources of <mark>CO2</mark> that account for the incremental buildup of <mark>CO2</mark> in the atmosphere?&quot; and &quot;What are the main sources of heat that account for the incremental rise in temperature on Earth?&quot;</P><P>In answering those questions, Boutrous hewed to the Fifth Assessment Report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC), issued in 2014. His presentation and the cities' presentation overlapped significantly, acknowledging the historic contributions of scientists including Joseph Fourier, John Tyndall, Svante Arrhenius, Gilbert Plass and Roger Revelle.</P><P>But where Boutrous relied nearly exclusively on the U.N. report, which draws on science from 2012 and earlier, the plaintiffs cited more-recent and more-specific findings, like the National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment and the state of California's Ocean Protection Council <A href=""http://www.opc.ca.gov/webmaster/ftp/pdf/docs/rising-seas-in-california-an-update-on-sea-level-rise-science.pdf"">guidance</A> on sea-level rise, both released last year.</P><P>Under active questioning from Alsup, Oxford University physicist Myles Allen explained the details of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide's role in preventing infrared radiation from leaving the atmosphere, how various parts of the Earth absorb the molecules, and how the greenhouse effect works on other planets. He only got through about one-third of his material before he had exhausted his allotted hour.</P><P>&quot;I didn't know that U.S. courts did this kind of thing,&quot; he said in an interview afterward. &quot;I think it's great.&quot;</P><P>Another scientist called by the plaintiffs, Gary Griggs, an oceanographer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who led the state report on sea-level rise, said that sea levels have been rising an average of 1.1 millimeters annually and warned of the possibility that polar ice sheets could melt and cause catastrophic rises.</P><P>Boutrous used the IPCC data to point to decreases in sea surface height off the West Coast from 1993 to 2012 and highlight the uncertainties of future projections of sea-level rise. &quot;Even his own study is saying there's a 0.1 percent chance&quot; of a 10-foot sea-level rise off San Francisco by 2100, he said of Griggs' research.</P><P>Alsup asked the plaintiffs where they differed from <mark>Chevron</mark>'s positions.</P><P>&quot;They do agree that humans are putting <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide into the air, that does in fact cause warming, that does in fact cause sea-level rise,&quot; Alsup said. &quot;What critique would you make of what I just heard from the other side? They seem to be largely agreeing.&quot;</P><P>&quot;That's not what you see at all in the media, and that's why these points are emphasized,&quot; said Don Wuebbles, a University of Illinois atmospheric scientist who led a special science report for the most recent National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment and was assistant director at the Office of Science and Technology Policy under former President Obama. Wuebbles pointed out that over the past century, sea levels off San Francisco have risen 7.7 inches, according to tide gauges.</P><P>&quot;If you look at the time period since 2012, you actually go back to seeing an increase in the region,&quot; he said. &quot;That is a little different than the picture he [Boutrous] was trying to paint in his presentation. Again, the science does not stop in 2012.&quot;</P><P>The San Francisco and Oakland cases are among numerous lawsuits from California municipalities against oil companies for <mark>climate</mark> damages. Federal court Judge Vince Chhabria — located in the same building as Alsup — last week ruled that lawsuits from Imperial Beach, San Mateo and Marin County should not have been moved to federal court and sent them back to state court. He said that federal common law does not govern their claims. He's also handling suits from Richmond, Santa Cruz and Santa Cruz County but hasn't ruled yet on whether those should go back to state court. <mark>Chevron</mark> and ConocoPhillips are appealing Chhabria's decision.</P><P>&quot;As the defendants note, these state law claims raise national and perhaps global questions,&quot; Chhabria said in the order affecting Imperial Beach, San Mateo and Marin County. &quot;It may even be that these local actions are federally preempted. But to justify removal from state court to federal court, a defendant must be able to show that the case being removed fits within one of a small handful of small boxes. Because these lawsuits do not fit within any of those boxes, they were properly filed in state court and improperly removed to federal court.&quot;</P><P>Alsup ordered the other defendants in the suit — BP PLC, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, all of which had representatives at the hearing — to submit briefs within two weeks detailing any points of disagreement with <mark>Chevron</mark>. &quot;Otherwise, I'm going to assume you're in agreement,&quot; he said. &quot;You can't get away with sitting there in silence and then later say, 'He wasn't speaking for us.'&quot;</P><P>Plaintiffs criticized <mark>Chevron</mark> and the other companies' approach.</P><P>&quot;What we saw today was one oil company begrudgingly accept the scientific consensus while trying to overemphasize the extent of scientific uncertainty,&quot; San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said in a statement. &quot;The other four major oil companies refused to even participate or recognize the court has jurisdiction over them. Apparently they think they're above the law.&quot;</P><P>Other observers said that it was notable that <mark>Chevron</mark> acknowledged mainstream <mark>climate</mark> science, but that it could be years before the case is resolved. The companies have all filed motions to dismiss both suits; presuming the suits continue, both courts would need to reach decisions before an appeal could be heard.</P><P>&quot;The sea-rise evidence and the sea-rise data is so much stronger than it was six years ago that they can kind of use the IPCC as a conservative approach, whereas the plaintiffs are taking the current, state-of-the-art approach,&quot; said Bill Rossbach, a trial lawyer consulting for the Center for <mark>Climate</mark> Integrity.</P><P>&quot;I'm sure they have other bases for thinking that they are not liable, and those are all going to be put forth in legal arguments to have the court throw the case out,&quot; he said. &quot;There's a long way from here to them writing a check.&quot;</P><P><EM>Reporter Anne C.

While alternative scenarios with lower rates of increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases and temperatures exist, they all call for more frequent and lengthy heat waves in the future.

Agriculture is an emissions-intensive sector; it accounted for less than 1 percent of U.S. production (in real gross value-added terms), but emitted 10 percent of U.S. GHGs in 2014. Energy-related CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission sources—which dominate GHG emissions in most other production sectors—are dwarfed in agriculture by unique crop and livestock emissions of nitrous oxide and methane. Crop and pasture soil management generates the most GHG emissions, due largely to the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers and other nutrients. Enteric fermentation (digestion in ruminant livestock) and manure management ranks second. Agriculture and forestry are unique in providing opportunities for withdrawing <mark>carbon</mark> from the atmosphere through biological sequestration in soil and biomass <mark>carbon</mark> sinks. The <mark>carbon</mark> sinks, which are largely due to land use change from agricultural to forest land (afforestation) and forest management on continuing forest, offset 11.5 percent of total U.S. GHG emissions in 2014 (see <A data-id=""15176"" href=""/topics/natural-resources-environment/<mark>climate</mark>-change/agricultural-production-and-mitigation/"" title=""Agricultural Production and Mitigation"">Agricultural Production and Mitigation</A>).</P><H3>The National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment</H3><P>The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) aims &quot;to assist the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change.&quot; In this role, every four years it produces a National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment (NCA) that surveys and synthesizes the most recent science about <mark>climate change</mark> impacts and adaptation in the United States.

Hopes are fading that the European Commission can match “nice words” with action, EURACTIV was told.</P><P>The EU’s 28 industry ministers gathered in Brussels on 20 February for a meeting of the Competitiveness Council which discussed a European Commission policy paper (<A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/4108/attachments/1/translations/en/renditions/native"">communication</A>) for an “industrial renaissance”, published earlier in January.</P><P>“As you know, for Europe, energy prices are a big problem,” said Antonio Tajani, the Italian commissioner in charge of enterprise and industry behind the <A href=""http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-42_en.htm"">industrial renaissance</A> initiative.</P><P>Speaking to the press after the meeting, Tajani said: “The first action by the European Commission is to put on the table for the first time the money for European re-industrialisation – one hundred billion euros coming from regional funds.” Other funds available for re-industrialisation include the €40 billion available for <mark>innovation</mark> and scientific research under the <A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/"">Horizon 2020</A> programme, which runs until the end of the decade.</P><P>“First of all, we aim to address the high cost of energy and the lack of a unified energy market. I believe that this is probably the most important priority,” added Kostis Hatzidakis, the Greek minister for development and competitiveness who was chairing the ministerial meeting.</P><P>“We need to mitigate the negative impact of the high cost of energy which is twice higher than in the USA, or Russia. Especially, EU gas is three to four times more expensive [for EU companies] than for the USA, the Russian and the Indian competitors.”</P><P>Hatzidakis said the Greek EU presidency was preparing a letter with concrete proposals on energy prices for the spring EU summit on 20-21 March that will feature a debate on industrial competitiveness.</P><P>But he warned that the Greek EU presidency “cannot work out miracles within six months”.</P><P>“What we can do is lay the foundation for the new European Commission that will be formed after the elections to bring forward concrete legislative proposals,” Hatzidakis said.</P><P><STRONG>‘Nice words’</STRONG></P><P>This came as a major disappointment for business representatives who claim ministers shied away from stating the obvious, that current energy and <mark>climate change</mark> policies deteriorate the EU’s competitiveness and therefore urgently need correction.</P><P>Instead of clear-cut language, the <A href=""http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/intm/141115.pdf"">meeting’s conclusions</A> listed a number of research papers, including one by the European Commission on the <A href=""http://register.consilium.europa.eu/doc/srv?l=EN&amp;t=PDF&amp;gc=true&amp;sc=false&amp;f=ST%205599%202014%20REV%201"">high cost of energy</A> in Europe, but stopped short of saying what needs to be done to correct the situation.</P><P>In the US, cheap shale gas has turned around the fortunes of the world’s largest economy. The cost of electricity in the United States is a third or half that of the EU and gas prices are just one third of those seen on the old continent.</P><P>“The USA currently attracts massively industrial investments and jobs: This is a true industrial renaissance in the US,” said Peter Botschek of the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC), which represents 29,000 companies, producing about a fifth of the world’s chemicals.</P><P>By contrast, EU statements about an “industrial renaissance” were just “nice words”, Botschek told EURACTIV.</P><P><STRONG>‘More and better jobs’</STRONG></P><P>The European Commission’s ‘<A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/4108/attachments/1/translations/en/renditions/native"">Industrial Renaissance</A>‘ paper is scheduled to be on the table of the next meeting of EU heads of state and governments on 20-21 March, which will mainly focus on “growth, competitiveness and jobs”.</P><P>But Botschek said that the EU’s recurring calls for “more and better jobs” would remain empty words if the Commission did not back it with actual policy measures.</P><P>Both CEFIC and BusinessEurope, the powerful employer’s association, have underlined the reforms they believe are necessary to that end and will drive those points home again ahead of the March and June European Council meetings of heads of state and government.</P><P>“Indeed the re-industrialisation of Europe is the hostage of an ambitious goal given the relatively high energy costs,” said Botschek, adding that energy costs have been relatively higher in Europe than in other regions for many years.</P><P>“Two factors are changing the game,” he said – the emergence of shale gas in the US and increasing energy costs in Europe, where energy policy is “subdued to <mark>climate policy</mark> ambitions”.</P><P>“We did so by creating <mark>carbon</mark> costs, surcharges and taxes in order to stimulate low-<mark>carbon</mark> investment and to subsidise power production from alternative – but largely uncompetitive and unreliable – energy sources such as solar and wind. Those energy sources have been granted priority access to the grids thereby undermining the EU’s energy market design and the EU’s energy market liberalisation policies that aim for an EU Internal Energy Market to be realised in 2014,” Botschek explained.</P><P>The CEFIC representative said EU policies should instead focus on diversifying energy supplies, putting in place a functioning single energy market, and introduce <mark>climate</mark> policies that encourage rather than hinder growth in the manufacturing sector.</P><P>Botschek admitted that such policies would likely run into fierce opposition from environmentalists and some policymakers. “But we have seen also a massive campaign in the run-up to the Commission proposal for the 2030 framework, all geared at pushing further on the current policy which entails higher costs for Europe,” he contended.</P><P>“20 million unemployed in Europe speak their own language and this cannot continue to be ignored,” Botschek stressed, underlining the negative economic consequences of the EU’s “unilateral” <mark>climate</mark> policies.</P><P><STRONG>2030 targets for renewable energy and <mark>climate change</mark></STRONG></P><P>A European Commission consultation document, or ‘Green Paper’, for the EU’s 2030 <mark>climate</mark> and energy policy mentions a potential greenhouse gas emission-reduction target of 40%, and does not close the door on a 30% target for the proportion of energy that renewables should make up by 2030.</P><P>For the German chemical company <mark>BASF</mark>, the difference in energy price between Europe and the US is already driving investment decisions that may have consequences down the line for industrial jobs in Europe and Germany.</P><P>“Our sites are in competition with each other and with such a huge difference in energy prices, the decision is clear – the money is not going there [in Europe],” said Claus Beckmann, head of <mark>BASF</mark>’s energy and <mark>climate policy</mark> unit.</P><P>He cautioned however that decisions to relocate factories or build new ones would not happen overnight but over the long run. “It’s a question of time,” Beckman told journalists at a briefing at <mark>BASF</mark> offices in Brussels on 25 February. “We think the market for chemicals will increase in the future. The question is only where the production will be located.”</P><P>“It depends on what the public is willing to pay for <mark>climate</mark> action,” added Brigitta Huckestein, a senior manager for energy and <mark>climate policy</mark> at <mark>BASF</mark>. “I do not believe that the public is aware of this – that it will cost them money if they are going for such a high goal.”</P><DIV class=""ea-article-custom""><DIV class=""ea-article-custom-item""><H4>Positions</H4><DIV><P><STRONG>The European Federation of Waste Management and Environmental Services (FEAD)</STRONG> called on the European Commission to revise the draft guidelines on environmental and energy state aid for 2014-2020 so the recycling industry is also protected from higher energy costs resulting from funding of support to energy from renewable sources.</P><P>FEAD members draw attention to the fact that the draft Guidelines stress that state aid should be limited to sectors that are exposed to a significant risk of <mark>carbon</mark> leakage due to the funding of support to energy from renewable sources.</P><P>“If the draft Guidelines recognise that state aid should be limited <EM>only </EM>to sectors that are exposed to a significant risk of <mark>carbon</mark> leakage, the European private waste management industry would have to face high energy costs. Recycling activity benefits the environment through the avoidance of emissions in primary production processes and EU policy is designed to encourage higher levels of recycling.

Pat McCrory (R) when it comes to obstructing efforts to protect the environment?
	So extreme that even <mark>Duke Energy</mark> — McCrory's former <A href=""/2014/02/duke-energys-inside-connections-to-the-mccrory-adm.html"">longtime employer</A>, one of his <A href=""/2014/04/new-details-emerge-on-gov-mccrorys-duke-energy-mon.html"">top political benefactors</A>, and a <A href=""https://www.southernenvironment.org/news-and-press/news-feed/duke-energy-pleads-guilty-to-environmental-crimes-in-north-carolina"">major polluter</A> in the state — is calling on it to dial back the anti-environmental obstructionism.
	Speaking at a Jan. 29 forum on the state's energy future, Mark McIntire, Duke's director of environmental policy and affairs, urged North Carolina to take a different approach to the Obama administration's <A href=""http://www.epa.gov/cleanpowerplan/clean-power-plan-existing-power-plants"">Clean Power Plan</A> to cut global warming <mark>pollution</mark>. The plan is being <A href=""https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/content/2016.01.26_wv_et_al._scotus_stay_application.pdf"">challenged in court by 29 states</A>, including North Carolina, as well as by corporations and industry groups. The lawsuit is being led by Texas and West Virginia.
	McCrory <A href=""https://governor.nc.gov/press-release/governor-mccrory-criticizes-overreaching-regulations-will-raise-consumer-power-bills"">has charged</A> that the plan would raise electricity rates and amounts to &quot;federal intrusion.&quot; So his administration submitted a compliance proposal that <A href=""http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/2015/11/05/advocates-respond-to-mccrory-administrations-assault-on-clean-power-plan/"">fell short </A>of EPA's requirements, with the intention of taking the rejection to court — an approach that's earned condemnation from environmental advocates and criticism from <mark>Duke Energy</mark>.
	&quot;Quite frankly, the approach our state is taking is one that is not collaborative,&quot; McIntire <A href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/blog/energy/2016/01/duke-energy-wants-n-c-to-open-up-planning-for-epa.html"">told</A> the N.C. Leadership Forum panel. &quot;We are continuing to encourage the Department of Environmental Quality to think a little bit larger — let's bring all the stakeholders in the room.&quot;
	At the urging of some of those stakeholders, including utilities and industry groups, the McCrory administration did <A href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/blog/energy/2015/11/n-c-agrees-to-submit-alternate-clean-power-plan.html"">agree to develop a backup plan</A> that would comply with EPA requirements in order to avoid having a federal plan imposed on it.
	But apparently that was not enough to assuage <mark>Duke Energy</mark>'s concerns that the administration isn't doing enough to involve affected parties in shaping a constructive response to federal efforts to curb <mark>carbon</mark> emissions.<STRONG>NC fights rules despite being on track for compliance</STRONG>
	The Clean Power Plan experienced a setback this week, when the U.S. Supreme Court <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/us/politics/supreme-court-blocks-obama-epa-coal-emissions-regulations.html?smid=fb-share&amp;_r=3&amp;referer"">temporarily blocked it</A> as an appeals court considers the expedited challenge to the rule. The Obama administration <A href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/09/press-secretary-josh-earnest-supreme-courts-decision-stay-clean-power"">says</A> it's &quot;confident&quot; it will &quot;prevail on the merits.&quot; Most Americans <A href=""http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/11/02/61-percent-of-public-supports-clean-power-plan-in-states-suing-to-stop-it"">support the plan</A> — including a majority of North Carolina residents and those in most of the other states suing over the regulations.
	First proposed in 2014, the Clean Power Plan sets standards for power plants and goals for states to cut <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark>. States are supposed to submit compliance plans by September, though they can apply for a two-year extension. The first deadline for emission cuts comes in 2022, with full compliance required by 2030.
	<mark>Duke Energy</mark> challenged the EPA's ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions through the <A href=""http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jwalke/UARG%20members%20from%202006%20filing%20on%20PM%20standards.pdf%20-%20Adobe%20Acrobat%20Pro.pdf"">Utility Air Regulatory Group</A>, a broad alliance of energy companies; the case, which went to the U.S. Supreme Court, <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_Air_Regulatory_Group_v._Environmental_Protection_Agency"">largely upheld the EPA's powers</A>. Duke is <A href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/blog/energy/2015/10/duke-energy-looks-to-cooperate-with-states-on.html"">now working with the six states in which it operates</A> — the Carolinas, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio — to discuss ways to comply with the Clean Power Plan. All of those states are parties to the lawsuit against the plan.
	Under the federal rules, North Carolina would have to cut its <mark>carbon</mark> emissions 32 percent by 2030. Environmental advocates have pointed out that the state is already <A href=""https://mountainx.com/news/nc-fights-epas-clean-power-plan/"">on track to reach the required reductions</A> thanks to existing environmental laws including the Clean Smokestacks Act and the state's renewable energy portfolio standard.
	In a <A href=""http://wcqs.org/post/sec-van-der-vaart-defends-oft-criticized-deq#stream/0"">recent radio interview</A>, N.C. DEQ Secretary Donald van der Vaart acknowledged that the state would &quot;probably be able to achieve that mandate naturally.&quot; However, he said, &quot;that doesn't mean that I'm going to sign on to a rule that is inherently illegal.&quot; An engineer and attorney, van der Vaart previously worked as a North Carolina air quality regulator and in research and regulatory positions for private-sector energy companies.
	But his judgment of the plan's legality is not shared by the 18 states, two dozen power companies, clean-energy associations, and public health and environmental groups <A href=""http://www.nrdc.org/media/2016/160204.asp"">supporting the plan</A>. North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper, a Democrat who is running for governor, has also <A href=""http://www.citizen-times.com/story/elections/2015/08/12/roy-cooper-clean-power-plan/31534109/"">called on the state to comply</A>.
	&quot;When a politician and his appointees are dragging their feet on <mark>climate</mark> action even over the objections of one of America's biggest corporate owners of coal and nuclear generating plants, you know that they have gone off the deepest end of the unreasonable scale,&quot; according to an <A href=""http://nclcv.org/news/cib/20160208/"">analysis by the N.C. League of Conservation Voters</A>.<STRONG>Is nuclear power really &quot;clean&quot;?</STRONG>
	Speaking of North Carolina's renewable energy portfolio standard, that has also emerged as a point of disagreement between the McCrory administration and <mark>Duke Energy</mark>.
	Passed into law in 2007 by an <A href=""http://ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?Session=2007&amp;BillID=s3&amp;submitButton=Go"">overwhelming majority </A>of state lawmakers as a way to jumpstart a cleaner energy economy, <A href=""http://www.ncuc.commerce.state.nc.us/reps/reps.htm"">North Carolina's standard</A> requires the state's investor-owned utilities to meet 12.5 percent of their retail sales through energy efficiency or renewable sources by 2021. North Carolina was the first state in the Southeast to adopt such a standard.
	What constitutes a renewable source? Here's <A href=""http://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_62/GS_62-133.8.html"">what North Carolina's law says</A>:</P><BLOCKQUOTE>
	a solar electric, solar thermal, wind, hydropower, geothermal, or ocean current or wave energy  resource; a biomass resource, including agricultural waste, animal waste, wood waste, spent pulping liquors, combustible residues, combustible liquids, combustible gases, energy crops, or landfill methane; waste heat derived from a renewable energy resource and used to produce electricity or useful, measurable thermal energy at a retail electric customer's facility; or hydrogen derived from a renewable energy resource.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>What doesn't constitute a renewable source? The law is<A href=""http://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_62/GS_62-133.8.html""> clear on that, too</A>:</P><BLOCKQUOTE>
	'Renewable energy resource' does not include peat, a fossil fuel, or nuclear energy resource.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>But at a recent meeting of the <A href=""http://www.geology.enr.state.nc.us/web/lr/energy-policy-council"">N.C. Energy Policy Council</A>, a state advisory group, DEQ's van der Vaart <A href=""http://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/why-is-duke-energy-pushing-to-make-nuclear-clean/Content?oid=4988947"">pushed hard</A> for the group to call on the legislature to amend the law to include nuclear power on the list of approved energy resources — despite its serious safety and security risks, radioactive-waste disposal challenges, and intense water requirements. <A href=""http://www.wral.com/nc-environmental-chief-backs-restriction-on-solar-farms-incentives-for-nuclear-plants/15284709/"">Describing nuclear energy as &quot;clean,&quot;</A> van der Vaart and said it &quot;needs to be incentivized.&quot;
	<mark>Duke Energy</mark> is heavily dependent on nuclear power, which accounts for <A href=""https://www.duke-energy.com/north-carolina/nc-rate-case/our-energy-mix.asp"">56.8 percent of its generation mix</A> in the Carolinas, and CEO Lynn Good recently <A href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/blog/energy/2016/01/duke-energy-ceo-we-need-to-talk-about-nuclear.html"">discussed its importance</A> in a <mark>carbon</mark>-restricted energy economy. But even so, it was <mark>Duke Energy</mark>'s representative on the council, Rob Caldwell, who <A href=""http://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/why-is-duke-energy-pushing-to-make-nuclear-clean/Content?oid=4988947"">pushed back against van der Vaart's proposal</A>, arguing that a &quot;one-off&quot; vote for nuclear power wasn't wise. He also said the issue was &quot;significantly more complicated&quot; than van der Vaart described.
	In the end, the council delayed its vote on the recommendation. They plan to discuss it again at their next meeting in March.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""article-info border-top medium-padding""><H2 class=""h4"">Tags</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1.0,2.0,Positive

But they all have one thing in common: they are top voluntary buyers of <mark>carbon</mark> offsets and pursue these purchases as part of comprehensive <mark>carbon</mark> management strategies.</P><P>A new Ecosystem Marketplace report called <A href=""https://www.forest-trends.org/publication_details.php?publicationID=4858"" target=""_blank"">The Bottom Line: Taking Stock of the Role of Offsets in Corporate <mark>Carbon</mark> Strategies</A> dispels the myth that companies purchase <mark>carbon</mark> offsets to avoid taking responsibility for their contributions to <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Rather, 14% percent of companies publically disclosing <mark>climate change</mark> information to the CDP’s (formerly the <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project) annual survey practice “offset-inclusive <mark>carbon</mark> management,” meaning that they are investing in hundreds of unique emissions reduction projects in addition to directly reducing their <mark>climate</mark> impact through energy efficiency, improved product design and other measures. Offset buyers tracked by CDP spent $41 billion in 2013 to make their buildings and processes more energy efficient, install low-<mark>carbon</mark> energy, switch to cleaner transportation, design more <mark>sustainable</mark> products, and engage customers and employees around behavior change.</P><P>“There’s a common misperception that offsetting is a way for companies to ‘buy their way out of the problem,’” says Allie Goldstein, Senior Associate at Ecosystem Marketplace and the author of the report. “But when you dig into the CDP data, it’s clear that offset buyers are actually just using more of the tools at their disposal to reduce emissions, and they’re investing in these activities at a higher rate compared to companies that don’t offset.”</P><P>This new report analyzed data from 1,882 corporate <mark>climate</mark> performance disclosures collected by CDP in 2013 and 2014.</P><P>Offsetting is an indicator of a deeper <mark>climate</mark> commitment, with offset buyers engaged in activities that reduce their internal emissions at a higher rate than companies that do not buy offsets, according to the report. The typical offset buyer slashed almost 17% of their Scope 1 (direct) emissions in 2013 while non-buyers only reduced Scope 1 emissions by less than 5% in the same year. Offset purchases are one way to neutralize Scope 3 (indirect) emissions that occur upstream in a company’s supply chain or downstream in consumer’s use of the company’s products – emissions that are difficult to reduce by other means.</P><P>The majority of companies (214) offset emissions voluntarily, compared to 56 CDP-reporting companies that purchased offsets to comply with regulations. Companies based in regions with regulatory <mark>carbon</mark> pricing programs were more likely to buy <mark>carbon</mark> offsets, even on a voluntary basis, than companies based in locations without a cap-and-trade system or <mark>carbon</mark> tax. The European Union, home of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), hosts the largest number of buyers – both compliance-driven and voluntary – since even companies in unregulated sectors are more familiar with market-based mechanisms for emissions reductions.</P><H4>Voluntarily taking the lead</H4><P>CDP disclosers voluntarily purchased 16.5 million tonnes in 2013, according to the report, representing about a third of primary market demand as tracked by Ecosystem Marketplace’s State of the Voluntary <mark>Carbon</mark> Markets 2014 report.</P><P>US-based automaker General Motors topped the list of voluntary buyers of <mark>carbon</mark> offsets, purchasing 4.6 million tonnes of offsets over the 2012-2013 timeframe. Its Chevrolet division has been a leading buyer of <mark>carbon</mark> offsets as part of its commitment to <A href=""http://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/pages/dynamic/article.page.php?page_id=10357&amp;section=news_articles&amp;eod=1"" target=""_blank"">reduce its emissions by up to eight million tonnes of <mark>carbon</mark></A> – at an estimated cost of $40 million. Chevrolet has also promoted widespread adoption of a new methodology financed by the automaker that aims to <A href=""http://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/pages/dynamic/article.page.php?page_id=10196"" target=""_blank"">reward US-based colleges and universities for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects</A>, purchasing the first 500,000 offsets generated by these projects.</P><P>U.K.-based Barclays was second on the list of top voluntary buyers with 2.1 million tonnes purchased, including from an avoided deforestation project in Kenya and renewable energy projects in India and China. In its CDP disclosure, the bank noted its anticipation that tropical cyclones will alter the credit profile of some of its clients.</P><P>California-based utility Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and Brazil-based Natura Cosméticos tied for third place on the list of top voluntary buyers at about 1.4 million tonnes.</P><P>Natura has reduced its relative greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 33.2% over the 2007 to 2013 time period and offset all the emissions it couldn’t avoid through the acquisition of <mark>carbon</mark> offsets from reforestation, energy efficiency, fuel substitution, waste treatment and REDD+ (reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation), according to a company spokeswoman. The company prioritizes projects that generate other environmental benefits such as improvements in water quality, erosion control and promotion of biodiversity and social benefits in addition to offsetting <mark>carbon</mark>, she said.</P><P>In 2013, <A href=""http://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/pages/dynamic/article.page.php?page_id=9932"" target=""_blank"">Natura purchased 120,000 tons of <mark>carbon</mark> offsets from the Paiter-Suruí­</A>, an indigenous people of the Amazon who in June of that year became the first indigenous people to generate offsets by saving endangered rainforest using the Verified <mark>Carbon</mark> Standard’s REDD protocol.</P><P>Delta Air Lines is also on the top 10 list of voluntary buyers of <mark>carbon</mark> offsets and expressed concern in its CDP disclosure that rising temperatures could affect plane take-offs and that sea level rise may encroach on coastal airports.</P><P>The airline’s GHG emissions are primarily related to the amount of fuel it uses, which accounts for more than 98.5% of its total <mark>carbon</mark> footprint and almost one third of its total operating cost. This creates a major incentive to reduce its fuel consumption and costs through internal initiatives such as retiring smaller, inefficient 50-seat jets and replacing them with larger, more efficient aircraft, according to the airline.</P><P>Despite its fuel saving initiatives, Delta experienced a net increase in fuel consumption from 2012 levels due to growth in flying, leading the company to purchase and retire <mark>carbon</mark> offsets against its 2013 and 2014 emissions to achieve its voluntary goal of <mark>carbon</mark> neutral growth compared to 2012. The company’s offsetting strategy evolved from initially partnering with The Nature Conservancy to allow customers to purchase offsets to cover their travel emissions – Delta matches customer and employee offset purchases up to $25,000 every year – to purchasing offsets directly to achieve the airline’s voluntary goals.</P><H4>Following the compliance rules</H4><P>CDP-reporting companies purchased 32 million tonnes for compliance purposes in 2013, according to the report. These disclosures account for a subset of total primary market compliance demand, which the World Bank Group estimated at 174 million tonnes that year.</P><P>ExxonMobil was the top dog on the compliance side, purchasing 10.2 million tonnes of offsets in 2012-2013 – about 3 million more tonnes than Mexico-based cement manufacturer CEMEX – from dozens of projects developed under the Clean Development Mechanism. ExxonMobil is regulated under cap-and-trade programs such as the EU ETS, New Zealand’s ETS, and California cap-and-trade but has publicly advocated for a revenue-neutral <mark>carbon</mark> tax as the “more effective policy option.”</P><P>“Cap-and-trade systems inevitably introduce unnecessary cost and complexity, as well as unpredictable price volatility, as evidenced recently by the EU ETS,” the company wrote in its CDP disclosure. “It is important to remember that a cap-and-trade system requires a new market infrastructure for traders to trade emissions allowances.”</P><P>ExxonMobil mimics the effect of a tax through using a proxy cost of <mark>carbon</mark> embedded in its Outlook for Energy report. “Our proxy cost, which in some areas may approach $80/ton over our Outlook period, is our effort to quantify what we believe government policies could cost to our investment opportunities,” the company disclosed.</P><P>Delta has also been a compliance buyer of offsets, but sees the longer-term risk to the airline industry of neutralizing growing international emissions after 2020 through the International Commercial Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) <A href=""https://www.iata.org/policy/environment/Documents/atag-paper-on-cng2020-july2013.pdf"" target=""_blank"">development of a market-based program</A>. As part of the International Air Transport Association, the trade association of the world’s airlines, Delta said it is currently engaged with ICAO in the development of a <mark>carbon</mark> offset approach to address the risk.</P><P>“With our current offset program, we are gaining experience in the <mark>carbon</mark> market,” a company spokeswoman says.</P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,1.0,Strongly Positive

Tony attended the recent ADB-China Datang Corporation CCS Workshop and <mark>Carbon</mark> Capture Forum, presenting alongside China’s Ministry of Science and Technology, Huaneng Group, <mark>PetroChina</mark>, Sinopec and a number of universities and international companies. The following Insight outline's the Datang CCS Workshop and the MOST <mark>Carbon</mark> Capture Forum held during the event. </EM></P><H2>Datang CCS Workshop</H2><P>On 30 March 2015, I attended the ADB-China Datang Corporation CCS workshop, held in Beijing, China. My time at the event clearly demonstrated that <mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage (CCS) remains an important research priority in China, particularly as the rapidly growing demand for energy continues to impact on air quality and <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. The workshop marks the conclusion of a technical assistance project co-funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Global CCS Institute. In attendance were representatives from Asian Development Bank (ADB), the British Embassy, Canadian Embassy, corporations and academic institutions.</P><P>An interesting presentation came from the Datang Corporation which has constructed and operated the world’s first <mark>carbon</mark> capture pilot plant for a natural-gas fired power station at their Combined Heat and Power plant located in Gaojing. The four year old project captures around 10 tonnes per day (tpd) <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>) from the station exhaust gas. The capture process is solvent-based and two types of solvent were used: modified MEA and ionic liquids. The flue gas contains around 4.6% CO<SUB>2</SUB> by volume. Due to the very low concentration of CO<SUB>2</SUB>, the energy penalty is around 4.36 GJ/t CO<SUB>2</SUB> captured.</P><P><EM>A model of the Datang <mark>carbon</mark> capture pilot plant</EM></P><P>This project is a milestone for <mark>carbon</mark> capture in natural gas power stations. The experiences and lessons learned will benefit other projects around the world. For Datang Corporation, this has become a very valuable platform for multiple purposes including:</P><UL><LI>demonstration of Datang’s commitment to low emission energy technology</LI><LI>a training platform for Datang personnel</LI><LI>a testing platform for CCS technology developers</LI><LI>a learning platform for Datang management</LI><LI>cultural transformation within the corporation</LI></UL><P>The power industry has its own unique culture and traditions for project management and O&amp;M guidelines. In contrast, <mark>carbon</mark> capture is in essence a chemical engineering process. During project implementation cultural collisions are often inevitable for project managers with electrical engineering backgrounds. This project has achieved significant organisational learnings for Datang Corporation. It has clearly improved awareness of emission reduction and the importance of CCS within Datang Corporation and in China. This learning was further evidenced in my discussions with Datang's senior management who reported many insights about CCS from the project.</P><P> </P><P><EM>Picture from the operational Datang pilot project</EM></P><H2>MOST <mark>Carbon</mark> Capture Forum</H2><P>On 31 March 2015, China Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) held a <mark>carbon</mark> capture forum in Beijing. The international forum was organised by China CCUS Alliance and the Institute. It was very well attended by people from China, North America, Europe and Australia. The Forum was chaired by Dr XU Shisen, President of Huaneng Clean Energy Research Institute (CERI).</P><H2>Support for CCS in China</H2><P>A senior official from MOST delivered the opening speech in which he summarised some major breakthrough CCUS projects in China. Two important factors for CCS development in China were highlighted:</P><OL><LI>The Chinese government has established policy to promote creation and <mark>innovation</mark>, “Made by China 2025”</LI><LI>The upcoming Paris Conference of the Parties (COP21) would likely achieve specific emission reduction targets for the world</LI></OL><P>Three expectations were raised:</P><OL><LI>Perform more in-depth investigations of CCS technology development trend and learn from others’ experiences and lessons.</LI><LI>Investigate how to promote creation-driven CCS development and how to apply CCS technology and to cultivate economic growth and explore new business models.</LI><LI>Strengthen international collaborations by incorporating discussions focused on commercial collaborations.</LI></OL><P>This speech clearly demonstrates the support for CCS technology development and commercialisation in China.</P><H2>Commercial CCS must be ready by 2030</H2><P>Dr Xu from CERI presented first. He mentioned that CCS has been cited in many national policies on <mark>climate change</mark> and energy. To meet expectations and <mark>climate change</mark> targets, the industry must be ready for deployment by 2030. He further emphasised that policy support and flexible financial tools are needed for deployment of CCS.</P><P>I was the second to present and shared my thoughts on <mark>carbon</mark> capture technology development. It is always good to see people in audience nodding during your speech. The focus of my presentation was CCS technology development, including:</P><UL><LI>An update on <mark>carbon</mark> capture technology development,</LI><LI>Comparative analysis for <mark>carbon</mark> capture cost reduction curve, and</LI><LI>Promising areas for next generation <mark>carbon</mark> capture technologies.</LI></UL><H2>New U.S.-China CCS partnerships</H2><P>A US Department of Energy (DOE) representative spoke after me and discussed the US programs. More importantly, it was revealed that during the Chinese president’s state visit to the US this September, an announcement will be made regarding four CCUS projects - two for each country. At least one of these will focus on CO<SUB>2</SUB>-EOR (enhanced oil recovery) and CO<SUB>2</SUB>-EWR (enhanced water recovery). The two governments are in discussions regarding the details of such projects.</P><P>After that, a variety of speakers presented including those from Huaneng Group, <mark>PetroChina</mark>, Shell, Siemens, Sinopec, CSIRO, Tsinghua University, Huazhong University of Science and Technology on various technologies for <mark>carbon</mark> capture. It was great to see the strong industry engagement and support of CCS technology.</P><P>During the panel discussion, Dr Xu asked me questions regarding the Institute’s role in China. He recommended that the Institute should not only bring knowledge into China but also promote China’s CCS expertise on the global stage. It was a great request and question to receive and the Institute is indeed planning to do more work in China, together with the Chinese government, industries and research community.</P><H2>CCS investment in China expected to rise</H2><P>Mr Kang from MOST concluded the Forum with a very informative and encouraging speech. The Chinese government invested RMB 600-700 million for CCS R&amp;D during the 12th Five-Year Plan with an industry matching fund of around two billion. For the 13th Five-Year Plan, more investments for CCS technology development are likely to be made by the government and industries.</P><P>The discussions during the Forum demonstrate China’s understanding of the role for CCS in emissions reduction and commitment to CCS technology development and deployment. The implementation of a national <mark>carbon</mark> trading scheme in 2016 would further improve the awareness of the need for emissions reduction among the wider community and within the government. Such a trading scheme would also be likely to accommodate CCS and to provide additional incentives for CCS deployment to enable CCS to compete alongside other energy technologies such as renewables.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,1.0,Neutral

The statement was coordinated by a large collective of organizations including World Wildlife Fund, Rocky Mountain Institute, <mark>Climate</mark> Mayors, Ceres and Bloomberg Philanthropies. It has grown to include more than 1,500 businesses and investors, as well as nine U.S. states, more than 200 cities and counties and more than 300 colleges and universities.</SPAN></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>In recent years, a number of initiatives and collaborations have sprung up around the world focused on private sector action on <mark>climate change</mark>.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION>And it’s not alone. In recent years, a number of initiatives and collaborations have sprung up around the world focused on private sector action on <mark>climate change</mark>. With Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris agreement, these initiatives have raised an intriguing question: In the absence of political action, can business save the world from devastating <mark>climate change</mark>?<P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>&quot;T</SPAN><SPAN>he simple answer is there’s no saving the world without business, but business can’t do it on its own,&quot; said Nigel Topping, CEO of <A href=""https://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org/""><SPAN>We Mean Business</SPAN></A>. &quot;The reason we need these kinds of coalitions is so that both business leaders and political leaders hear loud and clear that actually the majority of businesses understand that we’ve got to change, and actually are on board and already in motion.&quot;</SPAN></P><P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>We Mean Business is a global coalition of many of the same NGOs that initiated We Are Still In — CDP (formerly the <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project), the B Team, the <mark>Climate</mark> Group and others — and the two initiatives are closely connected. We Mean Business’s role is to provide a framework for corporate commitments on <mark>climate change</mark> and a platform from which to make those commitments public.</SPAN></P><H3>Science-based targets</H3><P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>One such commitment is to adopt science-based greenhouse gas emissions targets. This is where </SPAN><SPAN><A href=""http://sciencebasedtargets.org/""><SPAN>Science Based Targets</SPAN></A></SPAN><SPAN> comes in. This global collaboration among CDP, World Resources Institute, the World Wide Fund and the United Nations Global Compact encourages and helps corporations to align their <mark>climate change</mark> policies with scientific evidence.</SPAN></P><P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>&quot;What we could observe is a majority of companies were setting targets, but at least from a CDP perspective, we had many challenges to understand what targets were best,&quot; said Pedro Faria, technical director of CDP and member of the Science Based Targets steering committee</SPAN><SPAN>. &quot;Talking with companies and other NGOs, we realized there was no method, so companies were setting targets based on what was feasible and not what was needed.&quot;</SPAN></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>It has been extremely important to just make people aware of this concept: Set your ambition according to what the best available science tells you.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></SECTION>Science Based Targets helps companies determine what actions they need to take to contribute meaningfully to the global target of remaining below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) warming, a level above which experts say irreversible changes become locked in<SPAN>. These actions will vary across industries, so targets must be tailored to individual companies while still meeting global needs. Nearly 300 companies have signed on from every continent except Antarctica.</SPAN><P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>&quot;It has been extremely important to just make people aware of this concept: Set your ambition according to what the best available science tells you,&quot; Faria said. &quot;Our mission is to make science-based targets a new norm.&quot; Sixty-two companies have set approved science-based targets for emissions reductions. For example, Coca-Cola HBC — a leading bottler of the Coca-Cola Company — has committed to a science-based target of reducing </SPAN><SPAN>its emissions by 50 percent per liter of drink by 2020.</SPAN></P><H3>Energy for renewables</H3><P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>Another corporate commitment We Mean Business advocates is the goal of 100 percent renewable power. More than 100 companies, including Ikea, Walmart, Nestle and Unilever, have committed to this, but in a complex energy market like that in the U.S., buying this much renewable energy isn’t always easy. So in May 2016, Business for Social Responsibility, the Rocky Mountain Institute, the World Resources Institute and World Wildlife Fund started the <A href=""http://rebuyers.org/"">Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance</A> (REBA), which helps steer corporations through the energy market maze. The end goal is facilitating the deployment of 60 gigawatts of new renewable energy in the U.S. corporate sector by 2025.</SPAN></P><P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>The alliance first made its mark with the World Wildlife Fund and World Resources Institute’s <A href=""http://buyersprinciples.org/""><SPAN>Corporate Renewable Energy Buyers’ Principles</SPAN></A>, a set of six criteria developed in partnership with a group of large energy buyers to assist utilities in helping companies who want to buy renewable energy.</SPAN></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Microsoft has stated that it is committed to working with the network and new partners to bring more renewable energy onto the grid.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>But more was needed, said Lily Donge, a principal at the Rocky Mountain Institute. &quot;We realized that the buyers need a trusted space to learn about renewable energy and also find ways to interact with each other and the service providers on the sale side in a more transparent and seamless fashion.&quot; Thus was born the <A href=""http://businessrenewables.org/"">Business Renewables Center</A>, which Donge heads.<P class=""selectionShareable"">The center convenes, educates and assists corporations around purchasing off-site, large-scale wind and solar energy. It also hopes to facilitate collective buying, although that aspect is still in development. Donge envisages a scenario in which a city — for example, Seattle — its universities, its utilities and a locally based company such as Microsoft might come together to pool their renewable energy buying power. As one of the first to join the REBA network, Microsoft has stated that it is committed to working with the network and new partners to bring more renewable energy onto the grid. It is just one of the 60 percent of Fortune 100 companies that have set emissions reductions targets or committed to clean energy.</P><H3>Turning words into action</H3><P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>If We Are Still In is the sentiment, We Mean Business is the statement of intent, and initiatives such as Science Based Targets and the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance are the enablers of action, then America’s Pledge will be the scorekeeper.</SPAN></P><P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>Launched July 12, <A href=""https://www.americaspledgeon<mark>climate</mark>.com/""><SPAN>America’s Pledge</SPAN></A> will compile and quantify the steps taken by businesses, cities, states and others to address <mark>climate change</mark>.</SPAN></P><P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>Looking across these initiatives, it’s clear which industries are leading the pack. &quot;If you’re one of the IT majors and you haven’t committed to 100 percent renewable electricity, you’re a laggard, you’re a dinosaur and you really start to stand out,&quot; Topping said. But other industries face more existential challenges around <mark>climate change</mark> action, particularly in the fossil fuel space.</SPAN></P><P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>&quot;While many of the oil majors are publicly supportive of <mark>climate</mark> action and the Paris agreement, some of them are still proposing future energy and emissions scenarios in which there are very high levels of <A href=""https://ensia.com/features/sequestration/""><mark>carbon</mark> capture and storage</A> deployment — levels way higher than the current level of investment suggests is plausible,&quot; Topping said.</SPAN></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>There’s no sector where there’s a sectoral <mark>climate</mark> denial or sectoral resistance to Paris.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>But even those industries are publicly engaged. The <A href=""https://www.clcouncil.org/""><mark>Climate</mark> Leadership Council</A>, which launched June 20, features big oil companies BP, ExxonMobil, Shell and Total among its founding corporate members.<P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>&quot;There’s no sector where there’s a sectoral <mark>climate</mark> denial or sectoral resistance to Paris,&quot; Topping said. &quot;It’s just a question of what is the economic pathway of survival.&quot;</SPAN></P><P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>WWF’s Senior Vice President of <mark>Climate Change</mark> and Energy Lou Leonard said the challenge ahead for all these initiatives and collaborations is to continue to demonstrate the credibility of the voice of these sub-national actors to the rest of the world, particularly in the lead-up to 2020 when all countries are supposed to return to the table with even more stringent targets than were committed to in 2016, in accordance with the Paris agreement.</SPAN></P><P class=""selectionShareable""><SPAN>&quot;There’s going to have to be a continual injection of confidence and support from non-state actors and sub-nationals in the U.S. if you want those countries to keep [working toward goals],&quot; he said. &quot;This is where the future is, this is where we are going, and we want the rest of the world to know it.&quot;</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""field field-name-field-gbz-article-source field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix""><DIV class=""field-label"">This story first appeared on: </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,1.0,Positive

In 2013, the company spearheaded the <A href=""https://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2014/01/09/can-beef-industry-collaborate-its-way-sustainability"">formation of a global roundtable</A> of cattle ranchers, beef producers, processing facilities and others to define &quot;<mark>sustainable</mark> beef&quot; for each region of the world from which it sources hamburger meat — which is pretty much everywhere. Last year, McDonald’s began <A href=""http://corporate.mcdonalds.com/mcd/sustainability/signature_programs/beef-sustainability/<mark>sustainable</mark>-beef-starts-at-the-farm.html"">piloting</A> the standards with nearly 150 operations in its Canadian beef supply chain.</P><P>Those pilots are ongoing. Just last month, Cargill, one of McDonald’s go-to beef suppliers, <A href=""http://www.feedstuffs.com/news/cargill-pioneers-canadian-beef-traceability-pilot-project"">announced</A> that its Canadian Beef Sustainability Acceleration pilot, by the end of 2018, will provide customers with beef &quot;from operations that have been audited from 'birth to burger' using an industry-developed sustainability standard.&quot; The yearlong project will explore a variety of tracking technologies, such as DNA testing and blockchain, to design a process for producing verified <mark>sustainable</mark> beef &quot;that is robust while still being practical, scalable and cost-effective,&quot; according to a Cargill press release.</P><P>For two years, McDonald’s has been surveying suppliers such as Cargill for best practices in <mark>sustainable</mark> cattle raising and beef production. Among the things it wanted to know: &quot;What kind of projects are out there? Where do we need to engage?&quot; Townsend Bailey, director, U.S. Supply Chain Sustainability at McDonald’s, told me recently.</P><P>&quot;As we started asking these questions and looking at innovative companies, topics around grazing, and particularly regenerative grazing, kept coming up in one form or another,&quot; he said. Bailey and his colleagues met with various groups working on regenerative grazing practices. That led them to Byck, who was invited to present his project.</P><P>&quot;Townsend was very focused on scale,&quot; recalled Byck. &quot;He was like, ‘OK, let's say your science proves that grazing alone can regenerate the land and regenerate the farmer's pocketbook. How do you get to scale?’&quot;</P><DIV class=""media media-element-container media-gbz_inline_full_width""><DIV class=""image-caption""><P>McDonald's Townsend Bailey, in conversation at the GreenBiz 17 conference in Phoenix, Arizona.</P></DIV></DIV><P>Byck is quick to point out, &quot;I’m a filmmaker, not a farmer,&quot; but he knew enough about educating and motivating people to act on <mark>climate change</mark> that he had some ideas. &quot;It's about incentivizing people to change, not trying to make anyone change, because that's the last thing a farmer will do.&quot;</P><P>A lot was at stake. The world's soils hold a significant amount of <mark>carbon</mark> — more than double the amount in the atmosphere. For years, a small number of farmers have used techniques such as conservation tillage, cover cropping and crop rotation to reduce soil loss and keep <mark>carbon</mark> in the soil, which can improve soil health and fertility and make land more productive.</P><P>AMP is another tool in that toolkit. It involves moving cattle around grazing land for short durations in small, fenced-off areas called paddocks. Then giving paddocks long periods of time to rest, which catalyzes accelerated grass regrowth along with other flora and fauna. The method mimics the migrations of wild herd animals, such as elk, bison and deer, as they move from place to place. </P><H3>Buried treasure</H3><P>AMP’s potential is as critical to farming as it is to the <mark>climate</mark>. &quot;Soil is a living and life-giving natural resource,&quot; <A href=""https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/soils/health/"">said</A> the United States Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service. &quot;As world population and food production demands rise, keeping our soil healthy and productive is of paramount importance. So much so that we believe improving the health of our nation’s soil is one of the most important conservation endeavors of our time.&quot;</P><P>To the extent that America’s agricultural soil is a national treasure — and a buried treasure at that — industrial ag has been squandering it for decades. Today, the quality and quantity of soil in the United States represents, by some measures, a looming national catastrophe.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>To the extent that America’s agricultural soil is a national treasure — and a buried treasure at that — industrial ag has been squandering it for decades. </P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><A href=""http://resilience.earth.lsa.umich.edu/units/landuse/index.html"">According to</A> the University of Michigan’s Global Change Program, 96 percent of North America’s soil erosion comes from food production (66 percent from agricultural activities; 30 percent from overgrazing). The majority occurs in America’s heartland, where we produce much of our food. In significant portions of the Midwest, up to 75 percent of the topsoil has been lost, mostly due to modern farming techniques.<P>This is no small thing. A single gram of soil may hold a billion bacteria, which are able to perform an extremely wide range of chemical transformations, including breaking down organic matter and manufacturing nutrients inside roots. These processes are crucial to growing a healthy food supply.</P><P>Restoring soil health provides a number of essential biological functions. It regulates water, helping control where rain, snowmelt and irrigation water goes. It filters, buffers, degrades and detoxifies pollutants, including industrial and municipal runoff. It ensures the diversity and productivity of plants and critters that live in soil. It stores <mark>carbon</mark>, nitrogen, phosphorous and other nutrients. It anchors the roots of plants and trees.</P><P>And you can’t just make more topsoil. Generating three centimeters of topsoil takes 1,000 years, and if current rates of degradation continue, all of the world's topsoil could be gone within 60 years, a senior United Nations official <A href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/only-60-years-of-farming-left-if-soil-degradation-continues/"">told a global food forum</A> in 2014.</P><H3>Ground beef from the ground up</H3><P>Byck’s project will focus on two U.S. cattle-ranching regions: the Southeast and the upper Great Plains. His team includes 17 scientists from six agricultural universities and both for-profit and nonprofit research groups. Together, they’ll collect and study a variety of data.</P><P>&quot;We're looking at how the ecosystem functions,&quot; Byck explained. &quot;Can grazing alone be beneficial for the whole ecosystem of the farm?&quot; He said the project will be looking at a wide range of issues — &quot;from soil health, to greenhouse gas cycling, to the bugs and the birds, to animal well-being and farmer well-being. And we’ll compare apples to apples — folks who are doing AMP grazing with their neighbors.&quot;</P><P>Meanwhile, there’s the nontrivial goal of matching the McDonald's funding quickly in order be out in the field in the Southeast in 2018 and in the upper Great Plains in 2019. With $4.5 million in, there’s another $13 million or so to go.</P><P>The anecdotal evidence is compelling. &quot;I've been to about 30 different farms and ranches over the last few years filming, and it's just consistent,&quot; said Byck. &quot;The farmers will tell me they were in debt before they started focusing on soil health and started using these methods, and now they're not in debt.</P><P>&quot;They're seeing plants growing on their lands that people haven't seen in that county for 50 to 100 years, and they didn't plant them. They were able to weather droughts much better than their neighbors. They're seeing perennial streams that their grandfather had told them about, but which had been dry for their whole life. Just story after story, and consistent in dry areas, mountainous areas, wet areas, flat areas. We're seeing that farmers and ranchers are doubling, tripling and quadrupling their carrying capacity.

Our hope is that this project can be a great way to quantify the positive impacts of ranching and of beef production, and also provide light on best practices that could be implemented on the ground to bring about those positive impacts.&quot;<P>It’s not just an academic exercise, said Bailey. &quot;We think it could be hugely significant.

It's also a nature reserve and one of only two UNESCO Natural Heritage sites in the Arctic. It should be the most peaceful place on Earth, but in the last months this peace has been shattered. A Russian oil company has been sending giant ships through its waters, where grey whales migrate all the way from Mexico, threatening this UNESCO Natural Heritage site with noisy and disruptive seismic testing activities that can harm marine life. These ships are only the beginning, eventually the company plans to use heavy machinery to drill for oil nearby.</P><P>This is a really special place. Wrangel Island is home to the world's largest population of Pacific walrus and the highest density of polar bear dens on earth. Experts call it the Arctic's polar bear 'nursery', a place where hundreds of newborn cubs are carefully looked after. Thankfully, there's still plenty of sea ice in this area – which is crucial for the animals to learn to hunt and thrive in the wider world.</P><P>But these growing bears and walrus also need a calm environment to live in. Even small disturbances are deeply confusing for them. And yet in the last few months, we've discovered that <mark>Rosneft</mark>'s ships have entered the reserve at least four times in their relentless hunt for oil. At one point they spent over three days in the area.</P><P>The company is working alongside America's ExxonMobil, and is desperate to start this dangerous work. Their 'license blocks' overlap with the Wrangel Island nature reserve. This shouldn't be allowed to happen – it's a clear violation of Russian Federal law.</P><P>We wrote to the Prosecutor's Office asking what the company was doing there, because we doubted it was &quot;nature conservation&quot; – the only activity allowed here.

	Amsterdam, 22 November 2013 - Just five oil companies — Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and ConocoPhilips — are ultimately responsible for emissions equivalent to nearly 12.5 % of cumulative historical global industrial emissions of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and methane, startling new research has shown [1].
</DIV></DIV><DIV><P>This  new report exposes the companies that have made major contributions to  the <mark>climate</mark> crisis — and the investors that fund them — and for the  first time calculates their contribution to global industrial emissions  of greenhouse gases and potentially identifying their measure of  culpability for <mark>climate change</mark> impacts.</P><P>The  report comes as several leading civil society organizations walked out  of the UN <mark>climate</mark> talks in Warsaw, Poland to protest the lack of  progress in the negotiations and the failure of several governments to  stand up to the fossil fuel industry.  A major impediment to progress in  the <mark>climate</mark> negotiations has been the failure of rich countries to  provide financing to compensate vulnerable countries for damages caused  by the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>&quot;Fossil  fuel companies plan to exploit untapped oil and coal reserves while our  <mark>climate</mark> can't handle the amount of <mark>carbon</mark> that has already been  emitted. These companies must be held accountable for the damages they  have caused, and their plans to send us past a point of no return must  be stopped,&quot; said Kumi Naidoo, Executive Director of Greenpeace  International. &quot;Until governments finally act, we will have no choice  but to continue to intervene to prevent a <mark>climate</mark> catastrophe, acting as  the Arctic 30 did against the most powerful industry on earth.&quot;</P><P>The peer-reviewed research published in Climatic Change  on historic <mark>carbon</mark> emissions shows that the estimated emissions of 90  entities are equivalent to approximately 63 % of cumulative global  emissions of industrial <mark>CO2</mark> and methane (calculated as <mark>CO2</mark>  equivalents) between 1854 and 2010 [2].</P><P>The  90 entities are made up of 50 investor-owned companies, 31 state-owned  enterprises and nine former and current states [3]. Cumulatively,  emissions estimated for investor-owned companies amount to 315 Gt <mark>CO2</mark> e  (21.7%), for state-owned enterprises to 288 Gt <mark>CO2</mark>e  (19.8%) and for  former and current states to 312 Gt <mark>CO2</mark>e (21.5%). Of these emissions  estimated for <mark>carbon</mark> producers, half has been emitted since 1986.</P><P>The largest 10 investor-owned companies contributed an estimated 229.5 Gt of <mark>CO2</mark>e,  equivalent to 15.8 % of the estimated cumulative historical global  emissions through 2010. The 21 U.S. based companies included in this  study alone contributed an estimated 172.6 Gt <mark>CO2</mark>e (12%) of global  emissions through 2010. In 2010, investor-owned companies contributed  7,628 Mt<mark>CO2</mark>e or 242 t<mark>CO2</mark>e per second (equivalent to 27.3%) to the atmosphere.</P><P>The results are, that the estimated emissions of those 90 entities amount to 914 Gt <mark>CO2</mark>e of cumulative world emissions of industrial <mark>CO2</mark>  and methane. The entities are comprised of 83 of the world’s largest  fossil fuel entities (crude oil &amp; NGLs, natural gas, and coal) plus  cement manufacture´s emissions by 7 entities. The threshold for entities  to be included in this study was set at the production of ≥8 million  tonnes of <mark>carbon</mark> (MtC) in a recent year. Some entities have since been  added, while others were absorbed through mergers or acquisitions.</P><P>&quot;These  findings provide a ground breaking development and a new building block  in terms of potential legal outcomes to hold fossil fuel producers  liable for damage caused by <mark>climate change</mark>,&quot; said Stephen Leonard, a  lawyer and the President of the <mark>Climate</mark> Justice Programme.</P><P>The industry ranking was published after 28 Greenpeace International  activists and two freelance journalists were detained at gunpoint by  Russian security forces who seized their ship the Arctic Sunrise on September 19  after a peaceful protest at a <mark>Gazprom</mark> Arctic oil drilling platform.  Taking action to demand <mark>climate</mark> protection, these 30 brave men and women  have since spent the past two months in detention, charged with a crime  they did not commit.</P><P>St.  Petersburg courts have now granted bail to 26 members of the so-called  Arctic 30, 15 of whom have been released. But Australian activist Colin  Russell has had his bail request denied and the Arctic 30 still face at  least one serious charge that could see them spend years in a Russian  prison.</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark>,  and its partner Shell, the two companies that are leading the charge to  drill for oil in the pristine Arctic, ranked high on the list in the  study. <mark>Gazprom</mark> ranks 5th in the top 20 investor and state-owned  entities, while Shell is ranked at number six.</P><P>&quot;This  evidence should be further impetus for people all over the world to  follow in the footsteps of the Arctic 30 by standing up to these  companies. While those brave people could spend several years in a  Russian jail, the real culprits — companies like <mark>Gazprom</mark> and Shell — are  free to keep polluting the planet. They’re the ones who should be held  accountable and forced to stop, not the peaceful protestors who stand up  to them on behalf of all of us,&quot; said Ben Ayliffe, head of the Arctic  oil campaign for Greenpeace International.</P><P>For more information, please contact:</P><P>Swati Jangle, Communications Manager Greenpeace International</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></FORM></BODY></HTML>",2.0,1.0,Negative

There were only 39 final reports filed at that time. This limits our data, as final reports replace the initial reports on the TCEQ website after being filed (out of 143 final reports). Thus, 39 <EM>initial</EM> reports filed by 26 distinct facilities are missing from our collection.</P><P>For comparison sake, we included the ability to swap between data from initial and final estimates of <mark>pollution</mark> reported to TCEQ. Users can see which companies initially underestimated their air <mark>pollution</mark>, and which companies over-estimated the extent of <mark>pollution</mark>.</P><P>We included every incident reported to TCEQ Regions 10 (Beaumont), 12 (Houston) and 14 (Corpus Christi) from August 23, 2017, when many refineries began to shut down, to September 25, 2017, a month after Harvey made landfall. We also included data from other <A href=""https://www.tceq.texas.gov/assets/public/gis/images/regions.gif"">TCEQ regions</A> when reports clearly indicated that the <mark>pollution</mark> was a consequence of hurricane Harvey.</P><P>As of October 24, 2017, not all final reports have been published. 20 final reports remain un-filed. Many of these reports are “opacity events,” an industry term for smoke <mark>pollution</mark> at facilities, which are not measured in pounds and will not affect current totals.</P><P>We merged a few groups of chemicals for the sake of simplifying some of the data that is displayed. We consolidated various types of butanes, butenes, pentanes, pentenes, and xylenes, which were (infrequently) reported by companies with specific isomers or variations. We merged “xylene, mixed isomers” and “xylene-n” into “xylenes,” as an example. We also combined nitrogen oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) to display as “Nitrogen Oxides (NOx),” as both chemicals have <A href=""https://www3.epa.gov/ttncatc1/dir1/fnoxdoc.pdf"">similar effects</A> in terms of acid rain, smog formation, and human health. All other chemicals are listed exactly as companies reported them. If in doubt, follow our sources to the TCEQ website and look at the exact entry by the company.</P><H3>“Most Hazardous Chemicals”</H3><P>With credit to a September 1, 2017 <A href=""https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2017/air-<mark>pollution</mark>-09-01-2017.php"">report</A> by Shaye Wolf at the Center for Biological Diversity, our “most hazardous chemicals” list is very similar:</P><UL><LI><A href=""https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/xylenes.pdf"">Xylenes</A></LI></UL><H3>“Parent Company”</H3><P>In many cases, the TCEQ reports filed by petrochemical and industrial facilities are credited to the company that owns or operates the facility, but not the ultimate parent company. To the best of our ability, we have identified the ultimate parent company of each of the subsidiaries that filed reports.</P><H3>“Source Report No.”</H3><P>Each TCEQ has a six-digit number attributed to it. Adding this feature as a row or column of the database allows you to click on individual cells and open up the primary source data, and a link to the TCEQ page.</P><H3>“Equipment Source of Contaminant”</H3><P>Many of the facilities that were hit by Harvey are very large, and emitted air <mark>pollution</mark> from several distinct areas within the facility. The TCEQ reports specify which equpiment that chemicals were leaked, spilled, or flared from.</P><H3>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE DATA:</H3><P>Population demographics around specific industrial facilities was published in 2016 by the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. <EM>See PERI’s <A href=""https://www.peri.umass.edu/toxic-100-air-polluters-technical-notes"">methodology</A> for “environmental justice ratios”</EM> <EM>which notes that  “in 2014 in the U.S., the share of people living in poverty was 14.5% and the share of the population that identified as Hispanic or nonwhite was 36.3 percent</EM>.”</P><P>This data is displayed as “<STRONG>Population Living in Poverty (%)</STRONG>” and “<STRONG>Population People of Color (%)</STRONG>.” It is only applicable to specific facilities–for example, the data will not display as averages if you attempt to apply “Population People of Color” to the county of Brazoria, or to all facilities owned by ExxonMobil.</P><P>Some data was not available, but for seven facilities without available data, we were able to locate other facilities in the PERI database that are physically close (within a mile) of the facility without data.

One might think -- after years of focus on global warming -- that all the easy measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions had already been deployed. And yet, as governments engage in the 21st annual conference on <mark>climate change</mark> (COP21), some surprisingly low-hanging fruit remains.</P><P>
I don’t mean small fruit, either. I’m talking about big, high-yield fruit. Consider this: fitting energy-efficient electric motors on all pumps and fans with devices to regulate their speed would save 3,338 terawatt-hours, roughly equivalent to the amount of electrical energy produced in the EU in 2013.</P><P>
The opportunity is so huge because electric motors are among the biggest consumers of energy. They power all manner of equipment and account for about 40 percent of all electricity consumed worldwide. In the European Union, they are responsible for about 12 percent of total <mark>CO2</mark> emissions, second only to space-heating products.</P><P>
In recent years, the EU, along with several countries such as the United States and China, has imposed new rules requiring older, energy-hungry motors to be phased out. These rules, known as Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS), specify the minimum acceptable efficiency levels of a product, defining which products can be marketed and sold. Typically, these MEPS become more stringent over time. In the EU, for instance, rules requiring a higher efficiency class of motors came into effect in January 2015.</P><P>
MEPS in Europe and their equivalents in other countries will ultimately lead to the upgrading of the installed base of electric motors. However, at the current pace of implementation, and taking account of loopholes and enforcement issues, they will likely fall short of the energy savings needed to achieve <mark>climate</mark> goals, especially given that global energy consumption is expected to increase by 30 percent over the next 15 years.</P><P>
One reason is that MEPS specify the efficiency of individual products, in this case electric motors, rather than the efficiency of motor systems. No matter how efficient a motor is, if it cannot regulate its speed according to load, it will always be operating at full throttle. Legislation is gradually changing to take account of this -- for instance, EU rules that came into force in January 2015 specify that certain (less-efficient) motors must be able to adjust their speed. But only around 10 percent of motors in service worldwide are currently equipped with (variable-speed) drives that allow them to do this, even though the energy savings can be substantial -- up to 50 percent in some cases.</P><P>
Another challenge is to establish common MEPS globally. Again, progress is being made in this area, with more and more countries moving toward harmonized standards, but much remains to be done. A recent study commissioned by the European Commission concluded that if the most stringent current MEPS for product energy efficiency were harmonized today, overall global energy consumption would be 9 percent lower, and energy consumption due specifically to products would be 21 percent lower. This would save 8,950 terawatt-hours of electricity, equivalent to closing 165 coal-fired power plants, or taking 132 million cars off the road.</P><P>
The clock is ticking on <mark>climate change</mark>. The weight of scientific opinion is that we don’t have much more time to turn the tide on emissions; otherwise, it will not be possible to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, which is considered the maximum temperature increase we can sustain without triggering potentially catastrophic <mark>climate</mark> events.</P><P>
Of all the actions that can and are being taken to limit <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and mitigate the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, none holds out more promise than improving energy efficiency. There are numerous measures that can be undertaken immediately, without fear of harming economic growth; indeed, since most investments in energy-efficient technology are paid back within a year or two through lower energy costs, they can significantly boost competitiveness, and through the replacement of old equipment, generate additional economic activity. Fruit doesn’t hang much lower than this.</P><P>

But only around 10 percent of motors in service worldwide are currently equipped with (variable-speed) drives that allow them to do this, even though the energy savings can be substantial -- up to 50 percent in some cases.</P><P>
Another challenge is to establish common MEPS globally. Again, progress is being made in this area, with more and more countries moving toward harmonized standards, but much remains to be done. A recent study commissioned by the European Commission concluded that if the most stringent current MEPS for product energy efficiency were harmonized today, overall global energy consumption would be 9 percent lower, and energy consumption due specifically to products would be 21 percent lower. This would save 8,950 terawatt-hours of electricity, equivalent to closing 165 coal-fired power plants, or taking 132 million cars off the road.</P><P>
The clock is ticking on climate change. The weight of scientific opinion is that we don’t have much more time to turn the tide on emissions; otherwise, it will not be possible to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, which is considered the maximum temperature increase we can sustain without triggering potentially catastrophic climate events.</P><P>
Of all the actions that can and are being taken to limit carbon emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change, none holds out more promise than improving energy efficiency. There are numerous measures that can be undertaken immediately, without fear of harming economic growth; indeed, since most investments in energy-efficient technology are paid back within a year or two through lower energy costs, they can significantly boost competitiveness, and through the replacement of old equipment, generate additional economic activity. Fruit doesn’t hang much lower than this.</P><P>

Will <mark>BMW</mark>’s Solar-Wind Package Tap a New Target Car Market?
</H1><DIV class=""article-summary""><P>At upscale prices, <mark>BMW</mark> customers get green electric driving—but does that matter?</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""media-holder""><DIV class=""social-holder""><UL class=""social-networks ""><LI class=""comments""><SPAN class=""comment-count""><A href=""/articles/read/will-<mark>bmw</mark>s-solar-wind-package-tap-a-new-target-car-market#disqus_thread"" class=""link-mail"">2</A></SPAN></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><ARTICLE class=""article-body"" data-article-channel=""""><DIV class=""row custom add""><DIV class=""col-md-9 article-content""><P><mark>BMW</mark> is launching its all-electric ActiveE vehicle with a lease program for 700 dedicated customers. The pitch for the upscale car is that it's “100 percent electric and 100 percent <mark>BMW</mark>.”</P><P>
The rollout is basically “a <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/mixed-greens-ron-paul-furious-about-light-bulbs-<mark>bmw</mark>-creates-venture-fund-an/"">field trial</A>” of the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) marketplace for <mark>BMW</mark>, according to Green Mountain Energy Vice President Scott Martin. The ActiveE is not for sale. Only a two-year lease is available. <mark>BMW</mark> used a similar, 600-driver field test for its <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/test-drives-the-all-electric-mini-e-and-mercedess-f-cell-hydrogen-car/"">Mini E</A> electric car. <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/audi-mercedes-<mark>bmw</mark>-prep-electric-sports-cars-should-tesla-fisker-worry/"">Feedback</A> from that program informed preparations for the ActiveE rollout.</P><P>
This trial is aimed at what <mark>BMW</mark> calls “Electronauts” and will be limited to Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Sacramento, New York, Boston, and the state of Connecticut, where EVs are popular.</P><P>“<mark>BMW</mark> electric vehicle drivers,” Martin said, “are affluent, mostly urban individuals who put a high value on social responsibility and environmental friendliness. That’s according to <mark>BMW</mark>.” And, except perhaps for the term 'affluent,' Martin added, “that description lines up well with Green Mountain Energy’s customer.”</P><P>
To further appeal to <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/here-comes-the-revenge-of-the-electric-car/"">Electronauts’ enthusiasm</A> and concerns, Martin said, they will be given the opportunity, for a one-time fee of $48, to purchase renewable energy certificates (RECs) from Green Mountain Energy that will assure the electricity they are projected to use over the term of the two year lease will be offset by renewable energy.</P><A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/deregulation-doesnt-mean-healthy-competition/"">Green Mountain Energy</A><P> will obtain “regional wind” RECs from Western and Northeastern power systems. By purchasing from electricity distribution systems where the cars will be marketed, the Electronauts will, to the extent possible, be supporting local renewables.</P><P>
<mark>BMW</mark> is also offering its Electronauts the opportunity to install <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Solar-Installer-Insight-What-is-the-Best-PV-Panel-for-Your-Roof/"">residential rooftop solar</A> systems at a 35 percent discount. “This solar program, along with the new partnership with Green Mountain, demonstrates <mark>BMW</mark>’s truly holistic approach to <mark>sustainable</mark> mobility,” the company said.</P><P>
The renewables add-ons in the ActiveE marketing campaign, <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/embargo-<mark>bmw</mark>-picks-tendril-for-ev-charging-demo/""><mark>BMW</mark></A> said, eliminate <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/ethanol-or-electric-cars-the-debate-isnt-over-says-gm/"">critics’ claims</A> that EVs powered from a dirty grid still generate emissions. However, critics may argue that this is only partially true. An electric drivetrain’s increased efficiency can translate to fewer emissions from a coal-powered EV than from a comparable gasoline-powered vehicle. In any case, the Green Mountain Energy partnership raises another question.</P><P>
With record heat, droughts, and wildfires making <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/advertising-<mark>climate</mark>-change-a-study-of-green-ads-20052010/""><mark>climate change</mark></A> increasingly undeniable, Martin was asked, does offsetting matter? In answer, he pointed to markers of Green Mountain Energy’s success.</P><P>
In <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Ten-Years-in-Texas-Electric-Utility-Deregulation/"">the fifteen years Green Mountain Energy has worked</A> to reduce emissions growth, he said, it has funded some 50 renewable energy facilities and seen renewables’ cumulative share of U.S. electricity generation grow to 13 percent. “I can think of no greater proof of our standing and growth potential,” Martin said, “than the fact that NRG Energy bought us for $350 million.” Other markers of success, he added, include its expanding customer base and banner name clients like the Empire State Building and the NFL's Super Bowl.</P><P>
Because Green Mountain is now owned by NRG, Martin explained, numbers that show its customer base and revenues are growing are unavailable. Graphs of “<mark>CO2</mark> avoided” and “renewable energy served” in Green Mountain’s sustainability report may substantiate Martin’s claims.</P><P>
But the numbers aren’t the entire story, said Attorney Jerry Bloom, the Winston &amp; Strawn, LLC Energy Practice Chair. “The market is telling us that the people who are marketing, and here it is <mark>BMW</mark>, believe there is such <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/clean-tech-needs-to-shift-focus-to-the-consumer/"">a thirst and demand from consumers</A> for green products that it is valuable for them to be able to certify the product is green.”</P><P>
This demand, Bloom said, “is very grassroots, but at the same time is way at the top, with companies like <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/what-is-the-back-story-on-googles-renewables-play/"">Google</A> and Wal-Mart and Proctor and Gamble and Dow Chemical. These companies believe that for future growth, for strictly commercial value, they need to be able to certify they are green.”</P><P>
The new paradigm, Bloom explained, is “the commercial private sector paradigm that says, irrespective of what the government may or may not require, green in itself has a perceived value. And people are chasing that -- and they’re chasing it hard.”</P><P>
There are still a lot of the unanswered questions, he acknowledged. “What’s the measurement of green? When do you get to claim you’re green? What do you get to say in advertisements? That’s the next step. But the first premise is to say there is a value. <mark>BMW</mark> obviously believes that.”</P><A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/walmart-and-cdp-reaching-the-tipping-point/"">Wal-Mart now has a sustainability index</A><P>, Bloom said. “If you are Proctor &amp; Gamble, who makes more sales to Wal-Mart on a wholesale level than all their other sales put together, and you believe you have to do well on the sustainability index to maintain your sales to Wal-Mart, you are trying to figure out how to become greener. That’s the private sector talking. That’s the commercial market giving value to being green.”</P><P>
Another example, Bloom added, “is <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/green-light/post/rgy-efficiency-winning-global-green-stimulus-race-says-hsbc/"">HBSC</A>, a huge British bank. It now has a sustainability index for making commercial loans, strictly because of concerns about <A href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/sustainability-is-really-risk-management/"">potential liability and risk</A>. Companies that want to borrow money may have to bring down their <mark>carbon</mark> footprint to borrow money from HSBC.”</P><P>
A huge number of companies, and <mark>BMW</mark> is a perfect example, Bloom noted, “are saying, ‘We are only going to deal with green companies.’ How you quantify how big the demand is, I don’t know yet. What I do know is that this market is real.”</P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></UL></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,2.0,Positive

Daniel Yergin, host of the event and vice chairman of IHS Markit, endlessly put the topic to CEOs and ministers from foreign petro-states.</P><P>It became increasingly clear that days of denial or even skepticism around <mark>climate change</mark> is now out of bounds for executives of publicly traded oil and gas companies. Instead, they backed <mark>carbon</mark> taxes as an efficient, market-based way to control <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions. They discussed increasing investments in wind and solar. They talked about unleashing the industry's innovative capacity to find technological solutions, such as <mark>carbon</mark> capture, to keep fossil fuels viable.</P><P>&quot;The low-<mark>carbon</mark> future will reshape the energy space,&quot; said Eldar Sætre, CEO of the Norwegian oil major Statoil. &quot;Some see this as a threat to our industry, but we should rather look for and act on the opportunities it offers.&quot;</P><DIV class=""asset_item asset-item fullwidth"" data-config-asset-position=""7""><DIV class=""hdnce-e hdnce-item-58449""><IFRAME src=""//interactives.ap.org/2015/<mark>climate</mark>-change/?SITE=%5Btxsae%5D"" class=""ap-embed"" width=""100%"" height=""900px"" style=""border: 1px solid #eee;"">

The overwhelming consensus among scientists, however, is that human activities - namely, the burning of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal - are accelerating global warming.</P><P><EM style=""font-weight: bold;"">No argument</EM></P><P>For many in the oil and gas industry, argument is no longer an option as governments around the world join that consensus. In late 2015, the leaders of nearly 200 countries pledged to dramatically lower <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by 2050 in a pact signed in Paris and known as the Paris agreement.</P><P>As nations tighten <mark>carbon</mark> policies, wind turbines and solar panels have become the fastest growing new source of electricity both in the U.S. and worldwide. That has spurred what amounts to an international arms race on low-<mark>carbon</mark> energy, with China, Europe and the United States battling for supremacy.</P><P>European oil giant <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> is predicting that by 2100, 80 percent of the world's electricity will come from renewables, up from less than 10 percent today.</P><P>&quot;Now that may sound a bit shocking to have an oil company, particularly a big player in the gas business, talk about that,&quot; said Jeff Edwards, general manager of global gas and LNG development for Shell Trading. &quot;But that's just the reality as we see it.&quot;</P><P>Not everyone at CERAWeek was convinced that the age of fossil fuels is coming to an end. Harold Hamm, chief executive of Continental Resources of Oklahoma Cirty and a Trump adviser on energy, said he believed the oil and gas industry was unfairly targeted by <mark>climate change</mark> rules during the Obama administration and suggested that Trump would follow through on his campaign pledge to leave the Paris agreement.</P><P>&quot;We have a unique president today,&quot; Hamm said Wednesday, &quot;unique in that he keeps his promises.&quot;</P><P>Other executives and industry leaders called for investing trillions of dollars in new oil and gas projects to meet a growing demand for energy as developing nations, such as India and China, expand their economies. Chevron CEO John Watson dismissed theories of fast-approaching peak oil demand as &quot;wishful thinking.&quot;</P><P>&quot;You still have literally billions of people entering the middle class,&quot; he said. &quot;It may turn over, but if you look at the forecasts, most of them still show growing liquids consumption for some time.&quot;</P><P>That is true to a certain extent. The International Energy Agency is projecting economic growth in India and China will continue to drive up global crude demand for the next two decades. But by 2040, all bets could be off as renewable energy and electric cars are expected to become ubiquitous features of world societies, analysts said.</P><P>Already, the sharp drop in the price of renewable energy is forcing nuclear and coal-fired power plants to shut down, and slowing the development of new natural gas plants.</P><P>&quot;The trend lines are clearly more wind and more solar and all of that will continue to push fossil off the supply curve,&quot; Barry Smitherman, a board member at NRG Energy and former chairman of the Texas Railroad Commission and Public Utilities Commission, said Thursday.</P><P><EM style=""font-weight: bold;"">Asking for proof</EM></P><P>Investors, meanwhile, are taking note. A growing coalition of pension funds and institutional investors is increasing pressure on oil and gas companies to offer proof of how they will adapt their businesses to prosper in a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy. Some European firms, including Statoil and the French oil major Total, have already committed to putting defined portions of their capital spending to energy sources that do not produce <mark>carbon</mark>.</P><P>While oil and gas executives might be staying on message, the possibility of a U.S. withdrawal from Paris is causing anxiety among proponents of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Dirk Forrister, president of the trade group International Emissions Trading Association, said he worried if Trump did pull out, some developing countries &quot;might think the pressure's off.&quot;</P><P>But with Europe and China showing no signs of backing away from their Paris commitments, the general belief is the trend toward more <mark>carbon</mark> regulation is not going away.</P><P>&quot;The administration will stir up the pot to some extent,&quot; said Dan Reicher, a law professor at Stanford University who served as an energy adviser to former President Barack Obama. &quot;But I think the basic direction is increasingly being set by forces outside the administration.&quot;</P><P> </P><P><EM style=""font-weight: bold;"">Jordan Blum contributed </EM><EM style=""font-weight: bold;"">to this report.</EM></P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1.0,1.0,Positive

Skyrocketing food prices causing famine for millions and driving multitudes into poverty. Governments toppling - again - in Pakistan and Ukraine. Massive floods driving millions of refugees from their homes in Bangladesh and putting pressure on neighboring India. Droughts devastating harvests in traditional bread baskets like the U.S. and Brazil. The E.U., in a panicked move, suspending its environmental rules for agriculture and instituting a tax on meat. The world's top greenhouse gas emitters ultimately banding together to raise a global <mark>carbon</mark> tax.</P><P>The events described above are not the real world, but they could be. They were part of what transpired at <A rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://foodchainreaction.org/"" target=""_hplink"">Food Chain Reaction</A> a few weeks ago, a high-level crisis simulation in Washington, DC that brought together 65 international leaders to explore how <mark>climate change</mark> may strain the world's food system from 2020 to 2030.</P><P>What the simulation taught us, is that policymakers attending this week's<A rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/paris-cop21/"" target=""_hplink""> U.N. <mark>climate</mark> summit in Paris</A> cannot afford to neglect food security. The world's population is on a path to 9.5 billion by mid-century. That means we will have to grow up to 70 percent more food. <A rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.cargill.com/corporate-responsibility/food-security/the-challenge/index.jsp"" target=""_hplink"">To make matters more complicated</A>, we'll have to do so in a changing <mark>climate</mark> that alters the very way we grow our crops. We must figure out how we can make that happen within the limits of the Earth's natural resources. We've talked long enough. It is time to decide on a course of action that will actually improve the situation.</P><P>Will <mark>climate change</mark> by itself break the global food system in the next 10 to 15 years? That's unlikely. Prices right now are low and relatively stable. The system has enough resilience to absorb shocks. But add population growth, failed states, armed conflict and political instability to the mix and the picture starts looking a lot more combustible. Places that are already grappling with other strains may well be driven over the edge by <mark>climate</mark>-induced food price spikes.</P><P><A rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://foodchainreaction.org/index.php/issue/"" target=""_hplink"">That is not some far-fetched scenario</A>. The Arab Spring of 2011 came on the heels of record food prices caused in large part by extreme weather events as far afield as Russia, Ukraine, the U.S., Canada, Australia and Argentina. The protesters who poured into the streets of Arab capitals not only demanded political reform, but also the proverbial 'bread'. </P><P>The current violence in Syria was preceded by a severe drought and widespread crop failures in that country, exacerbated by failed agricultural policies. Hundreds of thousands of impoverished farmers fled to the cities. Mass protests led to civil war and the chaos we see today, most notably with a continued refugee crisis and the savagery of ISIS, that has now reached the streets of Paris and was felt in San Bernardino, California.</P><P>To be sure, food and <mark>climate</mark> were far from the only causes here. But many smart observers have pointed out that they had an impact and added to an already volatile mix. It would be unwise to ignore these analyses. </P><P><A rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://foodchainreaction.org/index.php/2015/10/27/what-is-food-security/"" target=""_hplink"">Food security</A> - ensuring enough safe, affordable and nutritious food for all - is often under-appreciated in <mark>climate</mark> discussions. It shouldn't be. What we've already seen in recent years should serve as a warning. Increased volatility is the new normal. It's not a matter of whether some hotspots will erupt, but when. It's up to all of us to be ready to respond. Having enough food for regions vulnerable to <mark>climate</mark>-induced calamities is job number one.</P><P><A rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://foodchainreaction.org/index.php/2015/11/11/they-came-they-played-they-offered-an-insight-into-our-food-future/"" target=""_hplink"">As the Food Chain Reaction exercise showed</A>, there are constructive ways forward. The players, an international cast of former cabinet secretaries, parliamentarians, high-level officials from national governments and international institutions, academics, business executives and think tank types, came up with a host of cooperative solutions. Among them: building cross-border information hubs and early warning systems, multilateral water management schemes, initiatives to curb food waste, technology exchanges and - most eye-catching - a global <mark>carbon</mark> tax. </P><P>All of these ideas merit discussion. Some may work, some may not. But what's most important is that the simulation highlighted the prospects for cooperation. Faced with mounting environmental challenges and international tensions, <A rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://foodchainreaction.org/index.php/2015/11/13/food-chain-reaction-insights-in-our-players-words/"" target=""_hplink"">the players chose long-term thinking</A> and multilateralism over closed borders and the short-term national advantage.</P><P>Secluded inside a Washington conference center, far from the searing eye of the media and armed with high-minded intentions, that is, of course, a lot easier than in the real world, where the game is often perceived as zero-sum and national electorates stand ready to punish leniency. But it also shows what can be achieved if actors come together, determined to solve big problems. </P><P>That's why organizations like <A rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.cargill.com/corporate-responsibility/food-security/"" target=""_hplink"">Cargill</A>, a multinational agricultural business, and <A rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/investing-in-a-food-secure-future"" target=""_hplink"">WWF</A>, a global conservation organization, are joining hands to delve into these defining issues. In different times we would have been seen as strange bedfellows, but the stakes are high and the clock is ticking. The longer we go without action, the deeper the problem will get and the more disruptive the measures we'll ultimately need to take.

Technologies related to electric vehicles are a typical example of CCMT technologies related to Transport.  Renewable Energy includes technologies in areas such as hydro energy, wind energy, solar energy and geothermal energy.  In Buildings, emission reductions are gained through better lighting, heating, ventilation systems as well as better elevators, escalators and increased thermal performance in general.    Traditional Energy includes improvements in fossil-fuel technologies and alternatives such as nuclear energy.  Clean Energy Enablers are technologies related to energy conversion or management systems that are also designed to reduce greenhouse gases.  Technologies related to batteries are example of technologies that would fall under this category as batteries are considered an alternative to using other types of energies that are more polluting.  Smart Grids are related to the imporvement of technologies related to an electrical supply network using digital communication technology.  Using communication technologies to optimize electricity usage ultimately empowers consumers to more effictiently control energy use thereby reducing the likelihood of outages. <SUP id=""fn13-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn13""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>13</A></SUP> Finally, <mark>Carbon</mark> Capture related technologies are designed to capture waste CO<SUB>2</SUB> and other greenhouse gases and inject it into deep underground rock formations for permanent storage. <SUP id=""fn14-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn14""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>14</A></SUP></P><P>The Canadian researcher data used in this report was obtained from Antoine Dechezleprêtre, Associate Professorial Research Fellow at the Grantham Research Institute on <mark>Climate Change</mark> and the Environment at the London School of Economics, and co-author of the UNEP and EPO report.  The analysis focuses on patent applications filed between January 1st, 2008 and December 31st, 2012.  The dataset consists of 7,873 high-value invention (HVI) patent applications with at least one Canadian researcher filed over the time span translating into 2,184 HVI patent families.  A patent family represents one or more published patents related to the same invention with a shared priority.  This report uses the same fractional counting approach as in the UNEP and EPO report for assigning patented inventions to inventors in cases where multiple inventors from various countries jointly filed a patent.  Using the fractional counting approach, the 2,184 HVI patent families equates to 608 HVI patent families.  This approach uses information on the inventor's country of residence or origin to determine in which country a patented invention has been developed.  For example,  in the case where a patent is filed by a Canadian, an American, and a Japanese inventor, Canada would be assigned one third of the ownership of the patent, the United States would also retain one third of the ownership, and Japan would retain the final third of the ownership.</P><P>In addition to examining CCMT patenting activity by researchers, this report examines the CCMT patent data from the perspective of business inventive activity.  The Derwent <mark>Innovation</mark> database was used to extract patent families that were filed in more than one country and where the basic patent, or the first member of the patent family, was filed between 2008 and 2012.  We refer to these patent families as high-value inventions.  The dataset consists of 99,935 high-value inventions in CCMT.  The Canadian businesses dataset represents approximately 1%, or 1,140 high-value inventions, of the total number of patent families worlwide involved in CCMT.  This is approximately half the size of the Canadian researcher dataset.  Similar to the researcher data, the business data is limited to patent filed between January 1st, 2008 and December 31st, 2012.  An absolute counting approach is used to assess the patented inventions to businesses.  The reason for not using the fractional counting approach for the business analysis is because the IP is associated with the company's country of origin based on its headquarter's location.</P><P>Time was spent treating the data to ensure that proper country codes were attributed to businesses. This is due to cases of missing address information as reported by the office where the basic patent was applied. Treatment included creating a database of business names from the dataset and attributing a country code to those businesses that were without a country code but that have already appeared somewhere in the dataset with one.  In doing so, the percentage of businesses without an address dropped from 5% to less than 1%.</P><H2 id=""toc-5"">Methodology</H2><H3>Patent analytics</H3><P>The development and adoption of new technologies are required to meet current and future environmental challenges. <SUP id=""fn15-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn15""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>15</A></SUP> Patent data is a good starting point for analysis of the development of new technologies as it provides important information on the specific <mark>innovation</mark> in the invention and who the inventors and applicant are.  Like any data source patent data has its strengths and weaknesses and if used in the wrong way it can lead to erroneous conclusions and poor policy.  The following provides context on the use of patents in understanding <mark>innovation</mark>.</P><P>While patents measure the flow of new ideas, it has been argued that patents may not measure <mark>innovation</mark> for three important reasons: patents do not include non-patented <mark>innovation</mark>s, not all patents result in commercialization, and many patents are strategic in nature. <SUP id=""fn16-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn16""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>16</A></SUP> For this reason the analysis is based on patent families that include applications in at least two jurisdictions.  This makes it more likely that these patent families will be a higher-valued invention and that the firm expects to commercialize the invention. <SUP id=""fn17-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn17""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>17</A></SUP></P><P>Another challenge presented is that many <mark>innovation</mark>s or inventions remain hidden as trade secrets.  These <mark>innovation</mark>s will be missed in a measure that includes only patents.  However, a 2008 study indicates that world-first innovators patent more frequently. Conversely, firms that patent infrequently tend to be imitators. <SUP id=""fn18-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn18""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>18</A></SUP> In addition, the study finds that firms that protect their intellectual property are more likely to increase their profits than those that do not.  In addition, SMEs that patent are more likely to be high-growth firms, which is important for success. <SUP id=""fn19-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn19""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>19</A></SUP> These conclusions are reinforced by a Canadian study that noted that firms that are aggressive innovators, introducing radically new products that involve patent protection, have higher profits. <SUP id=""fn20-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn20""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>20</A></SUP> Finally, while some inventions are not patented, patents are obtained for almost all economically significant inventions. <SUP id=""fn21-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn21""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>21</A></SUP></P><P>Below are the primary ways to view or interpret patent data:</P><DL><DT><STRONG>Market Reach</STRONG></DT><DD>Patent filings in foreign markets are a good indicator of firms accessing those markets.  Surveys have shown that firms that hold patents are more likely to be exporters <SUP id=""fn22-rf""><A class=""fn-lnk"" href=""#fn22""><SPAN class=""wb-inv"">Footnote </SPAN>22</A></SUP> .</DD><DT><STRONG>Innovative Activity</STRONG></DT><DD>When we do not account for filings in multiple jurisdictions we are double and triple counting the number of patented inventions or innovative activities.  In order to address this patent data allows for the formation of patent families where by each family includes all related or similar patents in all jurisdictions.</DD><DT><STRONG>Scientific Strength</STRONG></DT><DD>It is possible to identify the researchers or scientists, rather than the company or applicant.  While these can be the same, they are often different.  In this way we can see the inventive activity of Canadian researchers working in other countries or for non-Canadian companies.</DD><DT><STRONG>Relative Advantage</STRONG></DT><DD>Canada is a small open-economy.  For this reason it is unlikely that our industries or innovators would have an absolute advantage in a particular area, be the most prolific IP users or have the largest global market share.  However, there are areas where we have a comparative or relative advantage.  Much work has been done in the creation of metrics of relative technological advantage and relative specialization.</DD></DL><H3>Patent families</H3><P>The analysis of businesses and institutions is based on Derwent <mark>Innovation</mark>'s patent family data. These families are defined as drawing together patents covering the same invention and their relationship is defined by the priority or application details claimed by each document.  A patent family can be tagged to multiple classifications.  For this reason, it is important to note that when we say patent, we actually mean a patent linked to the specific classification regardless of if it was tagged to another one.</P><P>Similar to the EPO report, the patent family data in this report was used to construct statistics for &quot;high-value&quot; inventions.  High-value inventions are defined as patent families that are filed in more than one jurisdiction.  Although it can be said that patents are not all of high-value, it is rare to find that a successful invention was not patented.  This idea along with our methodology for using only patent families filed in more than one jurisdiction justifies our assumption that the patents in our datasets are high-value inventions.  Although it is very difficult to quickly identify the value of patents within a large dataset, it is a safe assumption that patents filed in multiple jurisdictions are likely to be of higher value than patents filed in only one jurisdiction.  By omitting patents filed in only one jurisdiction from the dataset, it was possible to limit the dataset to high-value inventions.</P><H3>Revealed technological advantage</H3><P>In order to gain a better understanding of Canada's strengths in CCMT research, we use the Revealed Technological Advantage (RTA) index, which was developed by the OECD and uses patenting intensity to allow for industries to be compared between countries of different sizes on a relative basis.  The index is calculated as a correction for the absolute numbers of HVI patent families in order to account for the fact that some countries file more patent applications than others in all fields of technology.  In this report the RTA index is used to determine where Canadians have a comparative advantage over competitors.  This report compares Canada's RTA index for each CCMT category to that of the G7 countries along with four other countries, China, Korea, Australia and Denmark.  China and Korea are included in the comparison because they are two prolific patenting countries.   Australia is also included because of its IPO's similarities with the Canadian IPO in terms of size and activity levels.  Finally, Denmark is included because of its specialization in the area of CCMT.</P><P>The formula used to calculate the RTA is as follows:</P><DL><DT><STRONG>Numerator</STRONG></DT><DD>The sum of HVI patent families for a category (or subgroup) in Canada divided by the sum of HVI patent families for the category (or subgroup) in the world</DD><DT><STRONG>Denominator</STRONG></DT><DD>The sum of HVI patent families in Canada divided by the sum of HVI patent families in the world

I am currently collaborating with a range of expert from different disciplines in order to understand the links between patterns and processes in natural systems, and to develop a conceptual framework within which to advance ecological theory. I am particularly interested in how &quot;metabolic theory&quot; can be applied to complex ecological systems. Body size and temperature determine basal metabolic rate, and the consequences of this are manifested across multiple levels of biological organisation, from molecules, to individuals, to entire ecosystems. Allometric scaling relationships are common in nature (e.g. body size versus ingestion rate, growth rate, interaction strength etc.) and can have potentially profound effects on the structure and dynamics of complex ecological networks (food webs, plant-pollinator networks etc.) and their ability to withstand perturbations.</P><P>In parallel with this ongoing work I am also developing new individual-based approaches to ecological networks. Most food webs published to date ignore the fact that trophic interactions occur between individuals, even though this is the level at which feeding links are realised.  An individual-based perspective can reveal surprising differences from the traditional viewpoint. Ultimately, one of my aims of my research is to use it to address more applied issues: in particular, I am interested in how food webs and ecosystems respond to stressors - especially <mark>climate change</mark>. If we can understand the underlying mechanisms then we are in a better position to be able to conserve, or even restore, damaged ecosystems.  Much of my current research is now directed towards studying geothermally-heated streams in Iceland, to study the impacts of global warming on natural systems.  </P><DIV class=""video-player"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DvEJGOyHMQ""><FIGURE class=""caption""><FIGCAPTION>Research Focus - Dr. Guy Woodward</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><H2>Research Group and Grant Awards</H2><P>Since 2005 I have been awarded &gt;£7M of external grant funding as a Principal or Co-Investigator.  n 2012 I was awarded £3.7m, including £430k as PI on part of a larger consortium (£3m) NERC grant led by Isabelle Durance at Cardiff University and £700k on a NERC Standard Grant led by Dr Mark Ledger. <SPAN>I wa</SPAN>s awarded £511k in 2011 as PI for another NERC Standard grant (&quot;Using individual metabolism and body size to predict <mark>climate</mark> warming impacts on aquatic food webs&quot;; Woodward, Reuman, Petchey &amp; Reiss).  In 2010 I was awarded &gt;£1m as a Co-Investigatior on two NERC Standard grants (PIs: Jon Grey &amp; Mark Trimmer). I was previously the Principal Investigator on a NERC Grant (£372k) &quot;Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships in fresh waters: a food web perspective&quot; (2006-2009).  I co-wrote another NERC Grant as the named PDRA (£338k [2005-2008]) investigating how the introduction of a top predator alters the structure and functioning of a stream food web and was awarded a further two years of funding (£575k [2008-2010) as Co-I under the NERC EHFI scheme to carry out an additional bottom-up manipulation of the same food web.

        Russian President Vladimir Putin talks to Igor Sechin during a meeting at the Kremlin in 2013 <SPAN class=""copyright"">Maxim Shemetov/EPA</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><DIV class=""article-wrapper clearfix""><DIV class=""main-content-column""><DIV class=""text-wrapper"" itemprop=""articleBody""><P>Igor Sechin, the boss of Russian oil behemoth <mark>Rosneft</mark> and one of the most powerful men in Russia, has declared European sanctions against his giant state-controlled organisation are an illegal affront to democracy.</P><P>In a rare interview, the man widely seen as being Vladimir Putin’s closest adviser said the world economy faced “severe consequences” as a result of the sanctions, which he said were “absolutely illegal and illegitimate”.</P><P>He also spoke of how <mark>Rosneft</mark> – 20 per cent owned by Britain’s BP – will cope with the collapse in the oil price, revealing that the company will be cutting its capital expenditure programme for this year by “approximately 30 per cent”. That will represent a savage reduction on 2014’s spend, said in October to be $14bn-$16bn. It follows cuts announced recently by other major firms around the world totalling $65bn.</P><P>Although predicting continued volatility and saying he did not want to get into a “guessing game”, he said the oil price could start to rise again in the final quarter of this year. This was because the current oversupply of oil was insignificant compared with previous oil crises like 1985, so the fundamental supply and demand equation did not justify the current price slump. Moreover, demand is rising, primarily in Asia, and not falling like it was in 1985, he said.</P><P>He repeatedly expressed his concerns that there could be a global shortage of oil if companies did not return to investing in production and output.</P><DIV class=""dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image""><DIV class=""dnd-caption-wrapper"">President of Russian petroleum company <mark>Rosneft</mark>, Igor Sechin, participates in a press conference in 2013</DIV></DIV><P>If investment levels recovered, next year’s price would be $60-$80 a barrel, he said. However, if they do not, and the supply-demand equation was not rebalanced, it could bounce back to $100-$110 as the lack of investment in drilling caused a shortfall in production.</P><P>He talked for the first time of his close bond with the senior management of BP, particularly Bob Dudley, the US-born chief executive who famously fled Russia in fear of his safety during BP’s battle with the oligarch partners of its BP-TNK joint venture.</P><P>And, speaking after <mark>Rosneft</mark>’s legal case against EU sanctions was sent from the High Court in London to the European Court of Justice, he declared: “We are fighting: the knot will be untied.”</P><P>Mr Sechin said <mark>Rosneft</mark> was prepared for a long haul in its battle to overturn the sanctions, placed on both him and the company by the US and EU authorities in response to the Ukraine conflict.</P><P>Asked about the prospects of the time extension of the case’s move from London to the European Court, he said wryly: “Instead of three years, the case may be a year and a half… What can you do? I don’t know if the case will be tried on merit and our claims will be justly reviewed and evaluated.”</P><P>He attacked the European authorities for the way the sanctions were applied in such a way to ban legal appeals against them: “That is what concerns me most… The EU imposed a ban in the European Court on accepting claims from Russian entities and individuals that have been subjected to sanctions. [This] has severe consequences, including consequences for European democracy. Is there an independent rule of law?”</P><P>Asked what his message would be to the governments of Europe, Britain and the US about the sanctions situation, he declared: “I am not a politician. I am just a manager. I can only wish them success in building a multipolar world for the benefit of all countries and nations.” </P><DIV class=""dnd-widget-wrapper context-full type-gallery""><DIV class=""dnd-atom-rendered""><DIV class=""container grid-mod-gallery"" data-scald-gallery=""3395221""><H2 class=""gallery-title"">Biggest oil producers (IEA figures)</H2></DIV><DIV class=""full-gallery""><DIV class=""scroller""><H2 class=""gallery-title"">Biggest oil producers (IEA figures)</H2><UL class=""legends""><LI data-gallery-legend=""1""><H2><SPAN class=""counter"">1/10</SPAN>

All those will face severe consequences.”</P><P>He added: “The world economy will face severe consequences. The application of sanctions against the company cannot be justified. We are not a subject of political decisions, so the extension of sanctions to the corporate level is absolutely illegal and illegitimate.”</P><P>He said it was not just Russians who suffered: 300,000 German jobs rely on equipment supplies to Russia.</P><P>Mr Sechin spoke at length about the current turmoil of the global oil market, saying the speed of the 2014 crisis exceeded anything before. Oil has crashed from $115 a barrel in June to just $57 today.</P><P>But despite <mark>Rosneft</mark>’s plans to reduce expenditure, he declared there would be no job cuts among its 235,000-strong workforce because the company is hiring crews to develop its in-house capabilities so as to rely less on outside contractors.</P><P>In the UK oil industry, Mr Sechin is best-known for the way he drove negotiations to strike a $53bn deal with BP and a group of Soviet-born oligarchs.</P><P>BP had tried with Mr Sechin to form an alliance with <mark>Rosneft</mark> in 2011 to jointly develop Russia’s Arctic shelf. But BP was already in a joint venture on Russia called TNK-BP with a group of oligarchs and Russia’s Alfa Bank. These partners, known as the AAR consortium, were outraged at the proposed BP-<mark>Rosneft</mark> alliance and successfully had it overturned in court. It was seen as a severe blow both to Mr Dudley and Mr Sechin.</P><P>Relations between the oligarchs and BP went from bad to worse until BP eventually declared it wanted to sell its stake in TNK-BP.</P><DIV class=""dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image""><DIV class=""dnd-caption-wrapper"">Russian oil giant <mark>Rosneft</mark> have their headquarters in Moscow</DIV></DIV><P>Mr Sechin said <mark>Rosneft</mark> would buy it. This was seen as a tactical manoeuvre to force the oligarchs to sell their half to <mark>Rosneft</mark> as well: Mr Sechin guessed AAR would never want to be joint shareholders in a Russian state-owned company run by Mr Putin’s right-hand man. The plan worked: BP sold its stake for $22bn plus a 20 per cent stake in <mark>Rosneft</mark> – a deal totalling $28bn. <mark>Rosneft</mark> paid AAR $27.73bn in cash in a deal closed in March 2013.</P><P>However, that transaction was completed when the oil price was above $100 a barrel, leading to accusations recently that <mark>Rosneft</mark> overpaid while the oligarchs and Alfa-Bank got the deal of the century.</P><P>But Mr Sechin refuted this when asked if he regretted the price: “Regret is not the word here. I think we can be proud we had the opportunity to strike a deal this complicated. We continue to increase synergy so the efficiency of the acquisition grows.”</P><P>He denied talk of a cantankerous relationship with the oligarchs, saying of the deal process: “You need to understand how challenging that job itself was, and how different the [various parties’] interests were. And everyone was standing their ground… During the stages that led to execution of that deal we did have some rough moments and we did have some discussions but that did not lead to any tensions in terms of personal relationships.”</P><P>Asked how he felt about the oligarchs now, he said: “They are very decent people, all of them.” He recently met Alfa-Bank chief Petr Aven. “He said he was missing me,” Mr Sechin laughed.</P><P>The long period of working with BP over the years had led to a strong bond with BP chief executive Mr Dudley and his predecessor Tony Hayward, who left in the aftermath of the Gulf of Mexico spill. “We have known each other for a long time. I am very familiar and very well acquainted with the members of the board and directors of BP.</P><P>“That is what I call trust and mutual consideration. Those things helped us successfully go through that enormous transaction – the largest acquisition in the history of oil and gas.”</P><P>The TNK transaction has left <mark>Rosneft</mark> with huge debts to repay. Given the collapse in the oil price and sanctions on the company, some investors have been concerned whether repayments are affordable, with some speculation <mark>Rosneft</mark> may seek to renegotiate terms or even default.</P><DIV class=""dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image""><DIV class=""dnd-caption-wrapper"">Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Igor Sechin (left) push the button launching a new oil terminal at the Black Sea port of Tuapse in 2012</DIV></DIV><P> </P><P>But Mr Sechin said: “I do not think there is any need to renegotiate it. We are managing all the payment schedules.”</P><P>Yesterday, the company paid the latest instalment of $7bn. Mr Sechin said other payments would also be made, adding: “The basis for our optimism is the actual economic performance of the company. Last year, the company’s revenue was $146bn.”</P><P>He dismissed talk of drawing on Russian state funds, saying repayments would be met from internal company funds. Despite the pressures faced by the company, it would also continue paying its dividend at 25 per cent of net profits.</P><P>The TNK-BP deal was one of the biggest steps in the Kremlin’s regrouping of Russia’s energy assets, which were split up during the Yeltsin era and sold often on the cheap to the oligarchs.</P><P>Asked if he might consider more deals, such as a takeover of Lukoil, he laughed, saying: “What does Lukoil have to do with that? In crisis there is always a good opportunity for mergers and acquisitions, but we are not looking at Lukoil.” He later added: “We don’t comment on the rumours. There is no such offer on the market now. That is why we do not comment on it.”</P><P>Sechin also denied speculation that <mark>Rosneft</mark> aims to consolidate the sector more generally: “This is impossible, these options will never be considered. The Russian oil and gas industry constitutes a part of the global oil and gas sector, foreign investors own around 25 per cent of it. And I would like to reiterate that <mark>Rosneft</mark> did not receive its assets through privatisation but acquired them on market-based terms – by paying for them.”</P><P>Mr Sechin also warned of the risk of manipulation of the oil market by financial investors and those “paper traders” who speculate on the price. He raised parallels with Libor fixing and the bogus valuations by credit rating agencies of US sub-prime mortgages.</P><P>The shares of US shale oil producers resembled the dotcom bubble of 1999, he hinted, pointing out that European exploration and production companies’ shares fell 42 per cent last year while US shale oil producers were still at January 2014 levels.</P><P>“Is it another bubble?” he asked.</P><P>He cited the example of America’s EOG, which is valued 34 per cent higher than Lukoil despite having 3.9 times lower reserves.</P><P>He also railed against the US for protectionism, saying: “Can you answer a simple question: why have the US been restricting oil exports from their country for 40 years? They are protecting their own refineries. They are providing competitive advantage for American refining.</P><P>“Can you imagine the same actions taken by someone like the Russian Federation? Let’s say Russia said ‘no more oil exports: refined products only’. What do you think the market would feel?… But we’re not taking that path. One needs to be reasonable.”</P><P><STRONG>Not so green: Sechin on the environment</STRONG></P><P>Igor Sechin is unlikely to win any awards from Greenpeace. He joked of how, at a conference this week where he was speaking, a member of the audience said people should be limited to alternative energy sources.</P><P>“I can tell you I am not a big expert in that area but I know a few things. First of all, we are the subject of global <mark>climate change</mark> cycles. I actually comforted the guy. I said: ‘Those cycles repeat every 30 million years, so everything is normal. The human effect on the environment is less than any volcano. A volcanic eruption produces more <mark>Co2</mark> than any human activity. The rotting of algae in the ocean significantly exceeds any man-made effect, so one should be calm about it.”</P><P>He did praise alternative energy, but stressed that it was expensive and that consumers would have to pay extra for it. “I am confidently saying that there should be no barriers. Both oil and gas need to be produced.</P><P>“Energy security needs to be provided for economic growth and the increase of people’s wealth throughout the planet.”</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1.0,2.0,Strongly Negative

The business world has not embraced action on <mark>climate change</mark> as statements from some corporations seem to indicate.</P><P>So says a new watchdog group out of London.</P><P>Nonprofit InfluenceMap late last month launched a website, along with a report called Measuring Corporate Influence of <mark>Climate Change</mark>, offering up a deluge of information that appears to prove that more than half of the world’s largest 100 companies are actually “obstructing <mark>climate change</mark> legislation.”</P><P>The group picked the companies from the Forbes Global 2000 list out in 2014, and it began compiling information en route to creating a ranking system that defines what they consider to be progressive organizations supporting <mark>climate policy</mark> and obstructive ones that are definitely not helping to battle <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Google Inc., Unilever Plc, Nestle Inc., <mark>Apple Inc</mark>. and Coca Cola Inc. are among those that graded above average. Koch Industries, Philips 66, Exxon Mobil, UnitedHealth Group, BP and AT&amp;T earned failing grades.</P><P>The group omitted financial companies and state-owned enterprises from its evaluation because they make up roughly 40 percent of the world’s upper echelon and the group would have dedicated much of their reporting on those entities, said Dylan Tanner, the group’s executive director.</P><FIGURE id=""attachment_383641"" style=""max-width: 300px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><FIGCAPTION class=""wp-caption-text"">How organizations communicate and deal with the public and government decision makers is a major consideration in InfluenceMap’s <mark>climate change</mark> grading system.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>InfluenceMap is made up of people like Tanner, the CEO of a web company whose assets include ww.ekobai.com, an online marketplace for <mark>sustainable</mark> suppliers, <mark>climate</mark> activists, <mark>climate</mark> researchers and the Union of Concerned Scientists.</P><P>Tanner said the group gathered its information over the past few years primarily through a “clever aggregation from public sources.”</P><P>The aggregate is a result of public hearings – for example when California called for public input after the state wanted to set new emission standards, and out came myriad opponents to detail publicly about how that would harm their organization – as well as information from environmental regulators, and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission in which companies were required to disclose regulatory risk.</P><P>Trade associations were another fount of information for InfluenceMap, since associations typically make their positions and their membership publicly clear, Tanner said.</P><P>The group also applied the science of linguistics and the study of language patterns to decipher intent from communications between company executives and policymakers – as opposed to what they say on their website, in press releases or in advertisements, he added.</P><P>“We try and extricate the PR from what the actual messaging is to the targeted individuals,” Tanner said.</P><P>The group keys in on CEO messages in speeches and in media interviews, such as when 21st Century Fox Executive Co-chairman Rupert Murdoch said during a 2014 interview with Sky News that “<mark>climate change</mark> should be approached with great skepticism,” and that “<mark>climate change</mark> has been going on as long as the planet is here.”</P><P>21<SUP>st</SUP> Century Fox is listed in the bottom five in rankings.</P><P>Tanner said his group lent great credence in their scoring to things executives say and do.</P><P>“CEOs have very strong sway with policymakers,” he said.</P><P>The evidence behind the dubious scores given to many companies seems bountiful – some companies have more than 200 pieces of evidence attached to their profiles on the group’s website, and Tanner said they’ve amassed more than 10,000 documents on the site.</P><P>The group gives Duke Energy an “F,” one of only four companies to earn that grade. Oil companies dominated the bottom half of the list.</P><P>Reactions from companies with bad rankings have come in slowly.</P><P>Shortly after the report was issued and the website unveiled the Charlotte Business Journal got response from Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke, which called the report methodology flawed.</P><P>A company <A href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/blog/energy/2015/09/duke-energy-gets-f-for-impact-on-<mark>climate</mark>-change.html"">spokeswoman told the publication</A>: “We take an active role to support environmental policies that will result in reasonable decreases in greenhouse gas emissions that balance the impact to customer rates and reliability.”</P><P>While some companies were dinged for openly opposing <mark>climate change</mark> regulation, others appear to be guilty by association.</P><P>Delta Airlines earned a “D-,” but not for its involvement with <mark>climate change</mark> policy and regulations, which InfluenceMap says appears to be limited.</P><P>“Delta’s score is impacted by a number of associations that appear to be negatively engaging with <mark>climate change</mark> legislation, with particularly strong ties to the International Air Transport Association (IATA),” the group states.</P><P>IATA gets a score of “F” for its “negative involvement with strands of <mark>climate change</mark> regulations,” the group stated.</P><P>InfluenceMap keeps separate lists for companies and “influencers” like IATA. American Legislative Council, American Petroleum Institute, Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, Western States Petroleum Association and National Association of Manufacturers are the other influencers with “F” grades on the website.</P><P>ALEC’s “F” grade isn’t a surprise. The U.S. nonprofit, which is comprised of conservative state lawmakers and members of the private sector who draft model legislation and focus lobbying on a state-by-state basis, has been under attack by activists for years.</P><P>Sierra Club, a progressive investor group, and other activist organizations have been waging an aggressive years-long attrition <A href=""https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2015/08/27/379923.htm"">campaign to force corporate participants, like State Farm, to leave ALEC</A>.</P><P>“They score lower than just about any organization we assess,” Tanner said.</P><P>ALEC’s European cousin is Business Europe. The Brussels-based group appears “to have active and obstructive engagement with numerous strands of <mark>climate change</mark> policy and regulations,” the group states.</P><P>The group is comprised of more than 40 central industrial and employers’ federations from some three dozen countries working toward a state goal of achieving growth and competitiveness in Europe.</P><P>As evidence backing its negative grade for Business Europe, which is among the bottom 12 associations on the list and has a grade of E – a grade InfluenceMap places between “D” and “F” – the group offers evidence suggesting Business Europe’s on EU <mark>climate policy</mark> is that it has increased energy costs and negatively affected growth.</P><P>Business Europe released materials in 2013 supporting the development of alternative energies, and calling for a “cost-competitive and coordinated energy and <mark>climate policy</mark> for 2030.”</P><P>Yet in that same document, “A Competitive EU Energy and <mark>Climate Policy</mark>,” the group also calls for phasing out support for the market deployment of energy produced from renewable sources.</P><P>“Renewable and low <mark>carbon</mark> technologies offer interesting market perspectives for many European companies,” the group states. “However the energy prices impact of current support schemes is not viable for the EU’s economy. Support for the market deployment of renewable should be progressively phased out to allow the market to determine energy choices.”</P><P>More than one-third of the companies on the list earned average or slightly above average grades. That may sound just fine, but the underlying theme in the report is that many companies appear to support action on <mark>climate change</mark> only in the public forum, a duplicity that’s reflected in the grading.</P><P>Microsoft Corp. earned a “C-” despite having stated support for the UN <mark>Climate</mark> Treaty, and support for the transition of the energy mix. Microsoft has made it known on social media that the company also supports U.S. government internal renewable energy targets, InflueneMap acknowledges.</P><P>The Redmond, Wash.-based software giant was downgraded because a senior executive is a board member of the National Association of Manufacturers and the company is a member of Business Europe, “both of which appear to be obstructing <mark>climate policy</mark>,” the group states.</P><P>Attached to each company’s listing on the site are PDF documents the group uses as evidence behind its scoring.</P><P>The scoring is a complex web of factors: corporate influence; an organization’s stance on <mark>climate</mark> science; its transparency on legislation; and its positions on emissions trading and renewable energies.</P><P>InfluenceMap compares these categories across an organization’s statements that appear on its website, postings made on social media and in CDP responses – CDP is the global not-for-profit through which companies and governments report, manage and share environmental information. Legislative consultations, media reports, CEO messaging, financial disclosures, and information found in the European Commission’s Union Register are other sources.</P><P>How organizations communicate and deal with the public and government decision makers is a major consideration in the grading.</P><P>“This is a circumstantial picture on these companies’ attitudes toward <mark>climate</mark> legislation,” Tanner explained. “It may be a better-than-subjective view of how these companies are behaving.”</P><P>What’s the endgame with InfluenceMap?</P><P>Tanner noted that the group is a nonprofit, so there is no financial goal.</P><P>“We saw a gap in the information in the assessment of companies on this issue,” he said. “Our goal is to bring the issue of <mark>climate</mark> lobbying out into the open and hopefully force a process of greater disclosure and hopefully analysis on this.”</P><P><STRONG>Past columns:</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></MAIN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,1.0,Positive

Toyota’s support for the IUCN Red List is the first project to preserve species to be implemented under the company’s scheme to reduce the environmental impact of automobiles, the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050. This year alone, the company will provide grants amounting to approximately US$ 1.2 million toward the project.</P><P>“The Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050 addresses not only <mark>climate change</mark>, but also biodiversity. They are two sides of the same coin which can’t be dealt with separately,” says <STRONG>Inger Andersen, IUCN Director General</STRONG>. “This generous grant from Toyota will enable our Red List researchers to take a big leap towards reaching our goal of assessing 160,000 species by 2020. This would also help IUCN’s work in supporting the implementation of the Sustainability Development Goals adopted last year by all the members of the United Nations, particularly the Zero Hunger goal.”</P><P class=""clearfloat""><STRONG>Didier Leroy, Executive Vice President of <mark>Toyota Motor Corpo</mark>ration </STRONG>says “When tackling threats to the global environment, it is important to act early and boldly with concrete steps that will make a difference in people’s lives. We did it in 1997 with Prius, and more recently with the hydrogen fuel cell Mirai. But protecting the environment is not just about CO and emissions: biodiversity is equally important to human lives. By entering this partnership with IUCN, we are very proud to take an additional step toward the challenge of establishing a future society in harmony with nature.”</P><P> IUCN’s ‘barometer of life’</P><P>The IUCN Red List assesses the risk of extinction of wild species based on past, present and projected threats. To date, 79,837 species have been assessed and more than 23,000 have been found to be threatened with extinction. The collaboration with Toyota will enable at least 28,000 more species to be assessed over the next five years.</P><P>“By doubling the scope of The IUCN Red List, it will become a more complete ‘barometer of life’,” says <STRONG>Global Director of IUCN’s Biodiversity Conservation Group, Jane Smart.</STRONG> “Toyota’s grant will enhance the Red List’s invaluable role in helping determine conservation policies; tracking progress toward reducing biodiversity loss; providing data for scientific research; and raising public awareness about species.”</P><P>Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050</P><P>Toyota is keenly aware of the importance of biodiversity in achieving sustainability, and has taken substantial steps to preserve and support plant and animal species around the world. In order to address these and other key environmental issues, the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050 was announced in October 2015. The program aims to reduce the negative impacts associated with automobiles to as close to zero as possible, whilst simultaneously making positive impacts on society. In order to help establish a future society in which humans live in harmony with nature, Toyota plans to globalize its long-running environmental grant program, and to create environmental preservation projects in collaboration with organizations that engage in such activities on a global scale.</P><P>Critical to food security</P><P>IUCN experts have chosen to focus much of the newly funded research on the populations of plants and fish that billions of people depend on as a vital source of food. These will include species of wild rice and wheat that are crucial to food security because they are the source of genetic material used to increase the yield, fertility and resistance to disease of staple crops produced by farmers across the world.</P><P>Additionally, marine fish, such as sardines, pilchards, sole and plaice will be assessed. They are not just a source of food for billions the world over, but catching and processing them also provides work for an estimated 200 million people worldwide.</P><P>The new grant will also be directed to work assessing other economically important plants, fungi, freshwater fish, reptiles, and invertebrates such as dragonflies, as well as upgrading the web platform used by more than 3.5 million people a year to access data on The IUCN Red List. Furthermore, the grant will support IUCN in carrying out activities to improve awareness about biodiversity.</P><P><STRONG>For more information or to set up interviews, please contact:</STRONG>

It is unstoppable, it’s just a question of when.”</P><P>Asked by this site after the event whether this meant that Formula 1 as the pinnacle of motorsport would have to become electric or become obsolete, she agreed.</P><P>The Costa Rican, who has been Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on <mark>Climate Change</mark> since 2010, suggested that racing involving internal combustion engines would have a future as an entertainment, a retro series, given that there are many beautiful cars from the last 100 years that people would want to see  – and hear – race. </P><P>But as a global sporting business and as a technology leader for the automotive industry there was no question of a long term for a series which uses hybrid or any other form of fossil fuel power units.</P><P>Speaking to <A href=""https://www.popsci.com/how-will-formula-one-reckon-with-electric-cars#page-4"">Popular Science Editor Joe Brown at the end of 2017</A>, F1 managing director motorsports Ross Brawn was asked about F1 having an electric future and responded, ““I don’t see it in the next five to 10 years. I can’t see that.</P><P>“We have some tough questions to ask ourselves.”</P><P>For the short term, he added, the new owners’ view is that what F1 needs is that “The show has to be the number-one priority. The racing, the drivers, the history, the noise, the smell, the atmosphere.”</P><P>Mercedes is reputed to be building a new V6 hybrid engine for this new F1 season, with 1,000hp from just 1.6 litres. But Mercedes is also entering Formula E and F1 team boss Toto Wolff says, “The reason for us joining is that our road cars are gonna go electric — that’s a fact.”</P><P>There is an hourglass running on Formula 1’s future as a fossil fuel powered series. As governments increasingly set dates to call time on sales of petrol and diesel engined cars, the waist aperture of that hourglass opens up. </P><P>The question, as Figures says, is how long? </P><P><STRONG> What do you think of these suggestions?

BP P.L.C.</EM> a month earlier, a different court in the Northern District of California remanded three &quot;global warming&quot; actions back to California state court. <EM>County of San Mateo v. Chevron Corp.</EM>, <EM>City of Imperial Beach v. Chevron Corp.</EM>, <EM>County of Marin v. Chevron Corp</EM>.</P><P>The County of San Mateo, the County of Marin, and the City of Imperial Beach filed suits in California state court against many of the top producers and sellers of fossil fuels worldwide claiming that the defendants knew that emissions from the fuels they produced and marketed created greenhouse gas <mark>pollution</mark> that has caused and will cause serious environmental impacts on the people of California, including flooding events and severe storms. Plaintiffs in these suits brought causes of action for public nuisance and strict liability. The defendants removed the cases to federal court.</P><P>In its remand opinion, the court granted the plaintiffs' motions to remand the proceedings back to state court because it found that removal based on the application of federal common law was not warranted. This court disagreed with the court in <EM>The People of the State of California v. BP P.L.C.</EM> and found that the Ninth Circuit decision in <EM>Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp.</EM> was directly applicable to the case. The court noted significant similarities between <EM>Kivalina</EM> and the instant matter, including the types of claims brought, types of damages sought, and the defendants named.</P><P>Based on these similarities, the court interpreted <EM>Kivalina</EM> to stand for the proposition that the federal common law is displaced by the federal Clean Air Act for both global warming related claims against direct emitters and energy producers. As a result, the court held that the plaintiffs' claims were not governed by federal common law and that federal common law did not preclude plaintiffs from asserting their state law claims.</P><P>The court then held that removal was also not warranted because: (i) the state claims were not completely preempted by any federal law; (ii) there was no actual, disputed, substantial federal issue requiring <EM>Grable</EM> jurisdiction; and (iii) no specialized statutory removal provision was applicable.</P><P>After determining that removal was not appropriate, the court stayed the matter for 42 days to allow the parties to consider whether the matter should be certified for interlocutory appeal or whether the remand order should be stayed pending appeal of the earlier remand order. The court requested a briefing schedule from the parties within seven days of the ruling.</P><P>The result of this ruling is that there is now no consensus, at least within the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, as to whether these suits brought by cities and counties in California against fossil fuel producers for global warming impacts should be in federal or state court. There are now rulings on each side of the issue that could be used by defendants and plaintiffs in other similar suits.</P><P><STRONG>Key Takeaway</STRONG></P><OL><LI>There is no consensus, at least within the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, as to whether suits brought by cities and counties in California against fossil fuel producers for global warming impacts should be in federal or state court.</LI></OL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,1.0,Neutral

In the email, which was shared by <EM><A href=""https://www.buzzfeed.com/johnpaczkowski/read-apple-ceo-tim-cooks-email-to-employees-about-trump?utm_term=.raeJpepR6#.pepEowojN"">BuzzFeed</A></EM>, Cook says that while <A href=""//www.macrumors.com/2017/05/31/apple-ceo-tim-cook-trump-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-accord/"">he tried to persuade Trump</A> to keep the United States in the agreement, &quot;it wasn't enough.&quot; Cook goes on to reiterate Apple's commitment to reducing its environmental impact through renewable energy and an eventual closed-loop supply chain.<BLOCKQUOTE>Team,

I know many of you share my disappointment with the White House's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement. I spoke with President Trump on Tuesday and tried to persuade him to keep the U.S. in the agreement. But it wasn't enough.

<mark>Climate change</mark> is real and we all share a responsibility to fight it. I want to reassure you that today's developments will have no impact on Apple's efforts to protect the environment. We power nearly all of our operations with renewable energy, which we believe is an example of something that's good for our planet and makes good business sense as well.

We will keep working toward the ambitious goals of a closed-loop supply chain, and to eventually stop mining new materials altogether. Of course, we're going to keep working with our suppliers to help them do more to power their businesses with clean energy. And we will keep challenging ourselves to do even more. Knowing the good work that we and countless others around the world are doing, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about our planet's future.

Our mission has always been to leave the world better than we found it. We will never waver, because we know that future generations depend on us.

Your work is as important today as it has ever been. Thank you for your commitment to making a difference every single day.

Tim</BLOCKQUOTE>Cook, who also shared his disappointment <A href=""https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/870439008316276736"">in a tweet</A>, was one of many tech leaders who attempted to persuade Trump not to pull the U.S. out of the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement earlier this week, but on Thursday, the president announced that the United States will indeed withdraw from the accord.

The CFTC order contends Cargill concealed its full mark-up because providing accurate marks might reduce Cargill's revenue. The CFTC also alleged that Cargill failed to diligently supervise its officers, employees, and agents relating to its business as a swap dealer. The regulator filed and simultaneously settled charges on Monday alleging Cargill had violated the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations but Cargill neither admitted nor denied the allegations.

Attracting manufacturers such as Audi, Jaguar, Mahindra, Renault and, from the 2019-20 season, Mercedes and Porsche, the electric single-seater series is in a position of enviably rude health.</P><P>The <A href=""/node/225290"" target=""_blank"">addition of electronics giant <mark>ABB</mark> as a title sponsor in a multi-year deal</A>, however, is potentially the biggest coup so far, with some suggesting an annual fee of around $15 million finding its way into the coffers.</P><P>It flies in the face of the current motor sport <mark>climate</mark>, one in which Santander has pulled its $40 million annual sponsorship of Formula 1 and Ferrari to enter the Champions League in 2018; McLaren enters another new season lacking a major sponsor; NASCAR continues to wrestle with Monster Energy to renew its contract and IndyCar has lost the support of Verizon.</P><P>By bringing on board a title sponsor that earns nearly $34 billion of revenue per year, Formula E has seemingly bucked the trend. Significantly, it could now turn a profit for the first time.</P><P>The results of the partnership, a week after FE made its announcement in London, were instantly clear at Marrakesh, with towering banners sporting the electronic giant’s name lining the circuit for its first round as sponsor.</P><P>But it wasn’t immediately clear why billboards sporting the <mark>ABB</mark> logo were there, or who <mark>ABB</mark> was. Even the company’s executives admitted that the giant suffers from a lack of identity when it comes to consumers.</P><P>“In the past, I think we were too humble as an engineering company to portray what we were contributing, which needs to change,” said Nicolas Ziegler, the head of global brand management, to a reporter from The Drum.</P><P>The trouble with longstanding energy infrastructure corporations is that they don’t have an obvious tangible product for spectators to engage with. <mark>ABB</mark> has been working behind the scenes since 1883, for example, and still anonymous to the wider world.</P><P>Those at <mark>ABB</mark> are adamant that Formula E will help the company shed its clinical image, as CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer’s impassioned speech stated: “Together, we will write the next phase of this exciting sports activity and foster high-performance teams,” he said.</P><P>“Together, we will write the future – one electrifying race at a time.”</P><P>Back at Marrakesh, <mark>ABB</mark>’s intentions were set out much more gently. A mock electronic charging station stood next to a model of its new fully electric ‘flash-charging bus’ –complete with battery changing robotic arm, which drops in a fully charged power supply from stop-to-stop.</P><P>The company also produces electric car chargers – more than 5000 are present in 56 countries around the world, with a growing business in charging networks. It should be noted that electric mobility isn’t <mark>ABB</mark>’s priority, but it’s an evolving part of a colossal firm that primarily focuses on producing the backbone behind electric grids, world over.</P><P>Those products alone make the reasoning behind its sponsorship of FE much clearer, and series founder and <A href=""https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/opinion/formula-e/formula-e-will-be-only-motor-sport"" target=""_blank"">CEO Alejandro Agag’s bullishness over the series’ staying power</A> seems to match comfortably with the tone of Spiesshofer.</P><P>Even more fitting is the fact that Morocco, which hosted the first FE round under <mark>ABB</mark> sponsorship (and the second of 2017-18), produces the fewest <mark>carbon</mark> emissions per capita out of any location in the calendar, with Chile, Mexico and Uruguay all relatively low CO<SUB>2</SUB> emitters. </P><P>Switzerland lifted its ban on motor racing for the first time in more than six decades to welcome Formula E in 2017, and it derives nearly 60 per cent of its energy from renewable sources.</P><H3>Related: <A href=""https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/september-1954/32/grosser-preis-der-schweiz"" target=""_blank"">Grosser Preis der Schweiz</A></H3><P>It is puzzling, then, as to why the United States is hosting the penultimate (or final, depending on whether FE secures a double-header on July 28-29) round after the electric grid hits Zurich on June 10.</P><P>The country is a thorn in the side of attempts to fight against <mark>climate change</mark>, with a lack of drive to reduce CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions and no signs of its leadership tearing the country away from its lucrative stash of fossil fuels; the round in New York seems an ill-fitting way to end the season.</P><P>It’s not just the USA. The presence of Hong Kong on the calendar, which sources a negligible proportion of its energy from renewable sources and has a continuing thirst for coal, should place the series at a crossroads.</P><P>A Birmingham round has been touted to be FE’s season-ender but, with a sponsor pushing its own green credentials and a series that urges a <mark>sustainable</mark> low-emission motor sport, perhaps there are more fitting locations than the United Kingdom to host the final two races of the 2017/18 series.</P><P>The CEO of <mark>ABB</mark> also questioned the UK’s motivation to increase the capacity of its charging network at the Formula E announcement in London: “The UK has a big population that really wants to contribute to a greener, more <mark>sustainable</mark> world,” said Spiesshofer.</P><P>“But there’s always a question of whether it’s quick enough. In the next couple of years, it’s in the interest of everybody to make sure the infrastructure is coming up.”</P><P>While the series will face questions over the lack of noise, the quality of racing and the choice of circuits, its barometer of success rests on whether FE’s environmentally friendly mission with <mark>ABB</mark> contains lasting substance. Or whether it will disappear under a smoky cloud.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""block-views-related-content-block"" class=""block block-views""><H3>Related &amp; recent</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,2.0,Positive

Even mainstream manufacturers like General Motors, Toyota, Volkswagen and <mark>Daimler AG</mark> have extensive plans in place to add hybrids, plug-ins and pure battery-electric vehicles to their line-ups. Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz, for example, plans 10 PHEVs by the end of next year.</P><P>What has long motivated a legion of Tesla fans — and driven the company’s stock to the sort of level generally reserved for Silicon Valley tech firms — is Musk’s vision and personal drive. He is also an effective user of social media, routinely tweeting on a variety of topics. And he released his latest strategy, appropriately enough, on Tesla’s blog site.</P><P>Musk is nothing, if not a visionary, and the Master Plan, Part Deux will clearly speak to the legion of followers who look to him to help change the world, with a focus on sustainability.</P><P>“By definition, we must at some point achieve a <mark>sustainable</mark> energy economy or we will run out of fossil fuels to burn and civilization will collapse,” he wrote. “Given that we must get off fossil fuels anyway and that virtually all scientists agree that dramatically increasing atmospheric and oceanic <mark>carbon</mark> levels is insane, the faster we achieve sustainability, the better.”</P><P>Of course, sustainability comes in many forms, and the challenge Tesla faces is, perhaps first and foremost, sustaining its own business. The carmaker is barely operating in the black — and, even then, only by using its own accounting procedures. Despite a stock price that has been running in excess of $200 a share in recent months, Tesla has been so short of cash it needed a nearly $2 billion May public offering to help fund the final development of its Model 3 sedan.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""section___1NkVN""><DIV class=""body___vDyiy""><SECTION class=""container___Ltqrl""><DIV class=""info___3BGcG""><H1 class=""title___1CDQX""><A href=""/video/tesla-s-master-plan-part-deux-is-revealed-729851971950"" to=""https://www.nbcnews.com/video/tesla-s-master-plan-part-deux-is-revealed-729851971950"">Tesla's 'Master Plan, Part Deux' Is Revealed</A></H1><SPAN class=""duration___27sD5"">01:13</SPAN></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""section___1NkVN lastSection___3zqOR""><DIV class=""body___vDyiy""><P>That’s Tesla’s first entry into the mainstream auto market, and initial signs are positive, with about 400,000 advanced reservations for the vehicle, which is set to debut at around $35,000. Tesla’s goal is to launch late next year and, by 2018, be selling 500,000 vehicles annually — or nearly 10 times its 2015 volume.</P><P>Despite the initial reception for the Model 3 it could be argued that the carmaker missed the mark, focusing on a new sedan at a time when Americans by the millions are abandoning passenger cars for light trucks. So, the addition of a compact SUV in the new Master Plan appears aimed at rectifying that problem. And it will be joined by a “new kind of pickup truck,” a move that will take it into one of America’s largest product segments.</P><P><A href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/electric-cars-aren-t-enough-tesla-now-going-vegan-n497396"">Read More: Electric Cars Aren't Enough: Now Tesla is Going Vegan</A></P><P>But Musk’s vision is that cars alone won’t save the world. Tesla may have been launched as an electric car company but it has been broadening its reach, notably with the addition of the Powerwall battery backup system launched last year.</P><P>Now, Musk wants to see the company become even more of a one-stop shop for all your green energy needs. That includes the ability to buy an all-in-one solar roof that would take advantage of Tesla’s proposed acquisition of SolarCity.</P><P>That move has generated plenty of controversy, in part due to the questionable synergies of the two companies, but also due to a seeming conflict of interest. A close Musk relative runs SolarCity and the Tesla CEO himself serves as the solar panel company’s chairman.</P><P>A fair section of Musk’s Master Plan takes a defensive tone. There is a strong defense laid out for the Solar City deal, for one thing. Pointing to the breadth of the Master Plan, Musk wrote that, “We can't do this well if Tesla and SolarCity are different companies, which is why we need to combine and break down the barriers inherent to being separate companies.”</P><P>The blog post also downplays the intense criticism that has arisen in recent weeks, ever since Tesla belatedly revealed the fatal crash of a Model S running in semi-autonomous Autopilot mode in Florida on May 9. In fact, the brouhaha, and news of two more crashes and several federal probes — one by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the other by the National Transportation Safety Board — may explain why the release of the new Master Plan comes a week later than Musk originally said.</P><P>&quot;When used correctly, (Autopilot) is already significantly safer than a person driving by themselves,&quot; he wrote in the new blog post.</P><P>If anything, Musk made it clear he is committed to fully autonomous driving, though he suggested it will need at least five more years of testing. But eventually, he made clear, Tesla plans to make all of its vehicles, commercial and retail, self-driving.</P><P><A href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/what-s-next-tesla-amid-safety-probes-weak-production-n610251"">Read More: What's Next for Tesla, Amid Safety Probes and Weak Production?</A></P><P>The company even appears ready to get into the ride-sharing game – in part by taking advantage of autonomous technology. Tesla appears to be interested in taking on giants like Uber and Lyft, and will tap its owners to help field a large fleet of vehicles.</P><P>“You will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and have it generate income for you while you're at work or on vacation,” he explained.</P><P>As broad as the Master Plan appears to be, the initial response is running from wildly upbeat to skeptical.</P><P>“The document is relatively short on details,” cautioned Deutsche Bank analyst Rod Lache, and though it discusses new products and ventures, he added, it does not lay out specific financial targets.</P><P>That concern seems reflected in Tesla’s stock price, which is sharply down since the Master Plan was announced, dropping 3.3 percent by Thursday afternoon.</P><P>Broad visions can be useful for a company entering uncharted territory. But Tesla is no longer a start-up. And there are growing demands for it to deliver. It needs to show that what it has already bitten off will work, many observers believe, before it moves on to the next grand plan.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""section___1NkVN""><DIV class=""body___vDyiy""><DIV class=""mobileNewsletter___3NlNx""><DIV class=""container___jsHMh news___34TC8""><DIV class=""signupBackground___27LhS""><H1 class=""signupTitle___15fvr"">Breaking News Emails</H1><DIV class=""signupForeground___2FAE6""><DIV class=""signupMessage___3ctJh"">Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The Planning and Building Act stipulates requirements for the assessment of natural damage in connection with all construction activity in Norway. NGI offers advice and guidance to developers and authorities with regard to prevailing legislation.</P><P>NGI has internationally recognised expertise in assessing the risk of natural damage. We help protect life and material values. Specialist expertise within the fields of natural geography, meteorology, geology, geomorphology, geotechnics, hydrology, rock mechanics, wave dynamics, monitoring technology, information technology, mathematics and physics gives us a unique basis as advisers to industry, authorities, land owners and other parties responsible for safety.</P><P>Our experts are familiar with local conditions in the majority of landslide, rock fall and avalanche-prone areas in Norway and have access to more than 50 years of experience data. We have mapped landslide-prone quick clay zones, as well as areas in Norway vulnerable to avalanches and rock slides. NGI has its own avalanche research station on Mount Strynefjellet and an office in Stryn. In the majority of major landslide, rock fall and avalanche incidents, NGI is approached to assist local authorities and offer advice on safety.</P><H3>Assignments and specialist expertise</H3><P>We assess landslide, rock fall and avalanche risks and operate landslide, rock fall and avalanche warning systems for the Norwegian Public Roads Administration, the Norwegian National Rail Administration and several local authorities, among others. The Norwegian Armed Forces utilise NGI's landslide, rock fall and avalanche expertise during all NATO winter exercises in Norway. NGI has actively worked on assessing landslide risk at Åkneset in Stranda municipality. Both here and in other fjord municipalities in North Western Norway, we have carried out detailed inundation modelling of tidal waves formed by landslides.</P><P>NGI's instrumentation department can supply customised monitoring systems for natural damage scenarios. For the authorities in Thailand and in partnership with several Norwegian institutions, NGI has assessed the risk of future tidal waves and prepared strategies in connection with this.</P><H3>Driving force for the development of the geosciences</H3><P>NGI frequently brings together authorities and institutions with landslide, rock fall and avalanche expertise to exchange experience. Participation in national and international research projects contributes to enhancing our expertise.</P><P>NGI took charge of one of the first centres of excellence, the International Centre for Geohazards (ICG). In partnership with the University of Oslo, the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and Norsar, NGI carried out R&amp;D on geohazards via the ICG from 2003–2012.</P><P>NGI was one of the main participants in the Geoextreme project and led the InfraRisk project that dealt with landslides, rock fall and avalanches, <mark>climate change</mark> and extreme weather events with regard to road and rail in Norway. NGI actively participates in several EU projects in the field of landslides, rock fall and avalanches and risk management and thus has close contact with international research.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""row full-width bottom-info no-print""><DIV :data=""getContactList(1905)""><DIV class=""row collapse"" v-if=""contacts.length &gt;0""><H4>/ Contacts</H4></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>",0.0,0.0,

Based on the 2015 listing of members we tracked down, (because IECA does not make their membership list public), the IECA is falsely claiming to represent companies  and appropriating their “worth” in the order of <EM>at least</EM> $200 billion. This group is grossly and intentionally exaggerating the opposition to the Paris Agreement and falsely leveraging the voice of member companies. Perhaps not surprisingly, IECA is supported by the <A href=""http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/global-warming/<mark>climate</mark>-deniers/koch-industries/"">Koch Foundatio</A><A href=""http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/global-warming/<mark>climate</mark>-deniers/koch-industries/"">n</A> and <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/15082016/donald-trump-economic-adviser-assault-trade-environment-regulation-epa-dan-dimicco-nucor"">Nucor</A>, which both fund <A href=""https://thinkprogress.org/nucor-ceo-funding-of-heartland-institutes-<mark>climate</mark>-denial-is-entirely-appropriate-9b8d75174815""><mark>climate</mark> denial</A> through groups such as the Heartland Institute. One company, when contacted about the IECA letter against the Paris Agreement, actually responded that it was not even aware of the IECA letter sent in their name to the White House in opposition to the Paris Agreement. </P><H3>Time to call out companies that oppose the Paris Agreement</H3><P>Consider that some of the companies the IECA falsely claims to represent, like<STRONG> <A href=""http://bteam.org/announcements/30-major-ceos-call-on-trump-stay-in-paris/"">Dow</A>, Alcoa, Corning and LafargeHolcim</STRONG>, have all written directly to the White House <EM>in support</EM> of the Paris Agreement. Given the emphasis placed on <mark>climate</mark> action by IECA’s own member companies, it seems very likely that the IECA is primarily speaking for a handful of polluters such as Koch Industries, rather than the other possibility that American companies are offering two contradictory and hypocritical stances on <mark>climate change</mark>. If the former is true, it’s yet another example of a small minority that wants to preserve profits at the expense of Americans. If the latter is true, then the companies should be called out for their hypocrisy. When the vast majority of companies have issued their support for the Paris Agreement, and made a strong economic case for why they support it, we must call out companies that are hiding behind polluter-backed trade associations opposed to <mark>climate</mark> action.</P><P>These companies must either come clean about their position on the Paris Agreement or extricate themselves from anti-<mark>climate</mark> groups such as the IECA. Companies that claim to embrace sustainability such as <STRONG>Eastman Chemical</STRONG> cannot claim social responsibility if they are also calling for withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and undermining America’s effort to reduce emissions through their membership in IECA. The <STRONG>International Paper Company</STRONG> signed the <STRONG>ABA <mark>Climate</mark> Pledge</STRONG> supporting a Paris deal, <STRONG>Owens Corning</STRONG> signed the Low <mark>Carbon</mark> USA letter supporting Paris, and <A href=""https://www.sabic.com/assets/en/Images/SABIC-Sustainability-Report-Technical-Supplement-2015_tcm12-19963_tcm1010-5617.pdf""><STRONG>SABIC </STRONG></A>has publicly touted their participation at the Paris COP21 venue —yet all three companies are in the IECA, which sent a letter to Trump calling for withdrawal from the Paris Agreement.</P><H3>The Paris Agreement supports America’s interests—despite what a few anonymous trade associations may claim</H3><P>What happens if Trump sides with a small band of polluters <EM>against</EM> the <A href=""https://www.nrdc.org/experts/han-chen/massive-support-paris-agreement-running-tally"">overwhelming support</A> for the Paris Agreement? He is going against <EM>thousands</EM> of companies worth several trillion dollars, institutional investors with over $17 trillion in assets, and seventy percent of Americans. Trump withdrawing from the Paris Agreement would be a <EM>huge</EM><EM>loss</EM> for the American economy and environment. Trump’s embrace of polluter interests and <mark>climate</mark> inaction makes America weak by increasing our exposure to the severe economic damages from <mark>climate change</mark> that affect homes and businesses across America, and to severe negative <A href=""https://health2016.globalchange.gov/"">health</A> implications for Americans for generations to come. The vast majority of American businesses have rightly stood up to Trump and asked him to stay in the Paris Agreement. A small minority disagree—but only via anonymous polluter-backed trade groups. The good news is, the anti-Paris companies-in-hiding are still far outnumbered. But with the tragic recent news that Trump plans to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, it’s time to call out these companies. </P><P><EM>* This blog has been updated to reflect that Goodyear ceased its membership in IECA in 2016, and was not a party to its May 15, 2017 letter urging withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, and that SABIC participated in the COP21 venue, not the negotiations themselves.</EM></P></SPAN><DIV class=""author-teaser""><H2 class=""center-title"">About the Authors</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,0.0,

Facilities in the U.S. Department of Energy-managed SEP program have met the ISO standard and improved their energy performance <A href=""http://www.energy.gov/eere/amo/superior-energy-performance"">up to 30 percent</A> over three years. For example, nine SEP-certified facilities have already saved, on average, <A href=""http://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/04/f21/superior_energy_performance_factsheet_0.pdf"">more than $500,000 a year</A> from improvements with little or no capital costs.</P><P>Business participation in the cross-border energy-saving program highlights the kind of international cooperation that is critically needed to combat global <mark>climate change</mark>.  </P><H3>The economic benefits</H3><P>It also underscores business' understanding of the significant economic benefits from smarter energy use and the potential economic costs of failing to respond to <mark>climate</mark> danger. The bipartisan business-focused <A href=""http://riskybusiness.org/"">Risky Business</A> Project warned of the potential costs to the U.S. economy from lower crop yields in the Midwest to massive property losses from rising sea levels on the East and Gulf Coasts.</P><P>The international standards are important to business, as the standards-setting <A href=""http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/benefitsofstandards.htm"">International Organization for Standardization</A> has noted, because they &quot;ensure that business operations are as efficient as possible, increase productivity and help companies access new markets.&quot;</P><P>The <A href=""http://www.ansi.org/"">American National Standards Institute</A> (ANSI) has called standards &quot;essential tools helping today's businesses stay innovative, reduce costs, improve quality and market their products or services.&quot;</P><P> &quot;They help break down barriers to trade, provide industry stability and encourage commerce,&quot; ANSI noted.</P><P>Earlier this year, I co-authored an op-ed with ANSI's Jason Knopes with the title: &quot;<A href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/265929-energy-efficiency-standards-help-businesses-thrive-and-consumers-save""><EM>Energy efficiency standards help businesses thrive and consumers save</EM></A>&quot; that reaffirmed the point that when specific standards are analyzed for their effects on the environment, jobs, and on economic benefits versus costs, it's apparent that standards overcome failures of the market and enhance economic growth.</P><H3>Successful savings</H3><P>The <A href=""http://www.cec.org/energy-program"">North American Energy Management Pilot Program</A>'s benefits have been demonstrated.

It claimed that the agreement could shrink U.S. gross domestic product by $2.5 trillion within two decades (though Trump stated the impact as coming within a decade). The report was criticized by some as being misleading, because that amount is less than 1 percent of the aggregate GDP over that period and the report did not account for the cost of taking no <mark>climate change</mark> action. Dayaratna was invited to attend Trump's withdrawal announcement in June in the White House Rose Garden.</P><P><STRONG>Paul Driessen</STRONG>, a senior policy adviser at the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, a libertarian environmental think tank: His organization handed out leaflets at a <mark>climate</mark> protest this year in Washington, D.C., that said, &quot;<mark>CO2</mark> is not the 'control knob' of the <mark>climate</mark>.&quot; He also co-founded <mark>Climate</mark> Exit, or &quot;Clexit,&quot; which criticized the science behind the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement and holds that spiking levels of atmospheric <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide benefit the Earth. &quot;The world must abandon this suicidal Global Warming crusade,&quot; the group stated in its founding statement. &quot;Man does not and cannot control the <mark>climate</mark>.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Gordon Fulks</STRONG>, a physicist and adviser to the Cascade Policy Institute, an Oregon-based libertarian think tank: He has denied that net sea ice melt is occurring and that the Earth is warming.

When you lose the quality of a place environmentally — the trees, the water, the space, the air — there are economic and human social consequences.

the wake of the recent signing of the US-China deal on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, Russia
is once again seen as a global outlier. Given Moscow’s lack of interest in
leading the <mark>climate</mark> battle, statements depicting Russia as the loser in this
development appear exaggerated.</P><P>Yet,
in the midst of excitement about the Obama-Xi <mark>climate</mark> accord, it is easy to
forget that 10 years ago Russia surprised the international community by
joining the Kyoto Protocol – a binding multilateral <mark>climate</mark> treaty that committed rich nations (at the time excluding
China and India, two of the largest greenhouse gas
polluters) to a moderate five percent average
reduction in emissions relative to 1990. The Kyoto Protocol is still the world’s only internationally binding
agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. On that
occasion, it was <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s new-found interest in the prestige of becoming
a ‘great ecological power’ (<EM>velikaya ekologicheskaya derzhava</EM>) that enticed Russia to endorse
the deal.</P><H2><STRONG>A great ecological power</STRONG></H2><P>But
why exactly did Russia join the Kyoto Protocol in 2004?  Many
observers speculated on this question: Russia has never championed
environmental protection on a global scale. During the lengthy pre-ratification
period, most Russian scientists remained ambivalent about the effects of global
warming. Meanwhile, Russia’s metallurgic sector has traditionally been among
the most energy intensive in the world. Until recently, the practice of flaring
natural gas was not seen as a worrisome practice. </P><P><EM class=""mag-quote-right"">Russia has never championed
environmental protection on a global scale.</EM></P><P>In
the early 2000s, both opponents and  supporters of the Kyoto Protocol tended to
view the commitment through the lens of the Russian economy and the country’s
national priorities. Ahead of the deal, two contrasting forces prevailed. </P><P>Russia
faced enormous challenges in terms of reviving its economy. It therefore
supported the argument advanced by other big emitters and transition economies
like China, Brazil, and India. These countries argued that they still hoped to
achieve the kind of economic development the West had been enjoying for
decades. Thus, they were unwilling to support any <mark>climate</mark> deal that would
hamper the attainment of that goal. </P><P>In
contrast, Russia did not want to lose the opportunity to add to its reputation
as a rising power on the world stage. Torn between the ‘developing country’ and
the ‘great power’ narrative, Russia’s ratification went through a long domestic
struggle before the final decision was made. Considering this domestic
bargaining and the country’s traditional low regard for environmental issues,
unpacking the incentives behind Russia’s ratification of the Kyoto protocol
becomes all the more interesting.</P><P><SPAN class=""wysiwyg_imageupload image imgupl_floating_none 0""><SPAN class=""image_meta""><SPAN class=""image_title"">The Kyoto Protocol logotype. Image: Marco Parilla via Wikipedia. Some Rights Reserved</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P>Initially,
many business groups opposed the treaty on the grounds that it would hamper the
growth of Russia’s economy. Certain academics even questioned the scientific
foundations of the Kyoto Protocol altogether. On the other side of the spectrum,
an eminent scientist, Nikolai Klyuev, from the Geographical Institute at the
Russian Academy of Sciences, introduced the idea of Russia as a ‘great ecological
power’. </P><P>In
line with Russia’s self-identification as a Great Power, and President Putin’s
strengthened national-patriotic ideology, the country welcomed the opportunity
to boost its image as a great ecological nation. </P><H2><STRONG>Putin’s hesitation </STRONG></H2><P>However,
in 2002, following the disappointment over the US withdrawal, Putin’s hesitance
became protracted. For Putin, the question of ratification had always been
political rather than environmental. In other words, the decision was guided by
the ‘relative gains’, which Kyoto could provide. </P><P>Subsequent
to the US rejection of the treaty, Russia’s economic interests in the Kyoto
Protocol decreased substantially, as it was left without a major buyer for its
emissions surplus. Moreover, some observers pointed out that if even a
rich country like the US was worried about the treaty’s economic impact, a
country such as Russia could ill afford it. Putin’s economic policy adviser,
Andrei Illarionov, was the most vocal among the critics. </P><P>Yet,
comparing Russia and the United States was misleading – the two countries were
in diametrically opposed positions. If the US had moved to ratify, the US would
have been obliged to take action to cut emissions, while Russia would actually
have gained through ratification due to sales of its surplus allowances.</P><P>Be
that as it may, after the US withdrawal, the EU undertook to save the protocol
by successfully rounding up enough signatories for the protocol to enter into
force in February 2005. Crucial to this was the EU’s diplomatic effort with
Russia. With the US’s refusal to join the treaty, only Russia carried the
weight to carry the treaty across the 55 % hurdle, that is, the combined percentage of
the industrialised world’s greenhouse gas emissions. By 2003, the industrialised
states that had ratified the Kyoto Protocol represented 44 % of these
emissions. Russia, if it also ratified the protocol, would add a further (critical)
17 % to this figure. </P><H2><STRONG>Political leverage</STRONG></H2><P>The
decisive role of Russia in the enforcement of global <mark>climate policy</mark> gave it
political leverage. In fact, to secure Russia’s participation, the country was
given more sink allowances, which effectively relaxed the emissions constraints
previously negotiated in Kyoto. The huge amount of <mark>pollution</mark> credits that Russia
won under the Kyoto’s emission trading system was the decisive concession, which
made Russia respond to the EU’s campaign of persuasion. </P><P>Many
observers speculated that Russia’s ratification of the protocol was a <EM>quid
pro quo</EM> for the EU’s support for its application to join the World
Trade Organisation (WTO). Besides the economic incentives, other contributing
factors included the political opportunity to boost Russia’s status while
leaving the Bush administration increasingly isolated internationally on
<mark>climate change</mark> issues. While these incentives could have played a role, they
pale in comparison to the key incentive: economic gains offered in <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s
favour. <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s support came from the realisation of the enormous profits it
could gain from selling unused emission credits, and investing these revenues
in clean technologies for the ‘greening’ of Russia’s economy.</P><P>Though
WTO accession loomed in the background, the decision to join Kyoto had much
more to do with the direct economic benefits Russia could extract from the
treaty than with considerations regarding WTO membership. <mark>Climate policy</mark> experts
estimated that Russia  benefited from the
protocol by roughly 10 billion dollars annually through emission trading, joint
investment projects, and increased foreign investments. The protocol set a zero
reduction target for Russia, meaning that Russian emissions could not exceed
the level of 1990 between 2008 and 2012, the first commitment period of the
agreement.</P><P class=""pullquote-right""><mark>Climate policy</mark> experts estimated that Russia benefited from the protocol by roughly 10 billion dollars annually.</P><P>Indeed,
Russia could actually increase emissions, or sell its excess emission
allowances to other states within the protocol without violating the agreement.
In 2003, the otherwise sceptical Russian corporate sector began to express
interest in the ‘capitalisation’ of climatic benefits. Alongside other energy
companies, <mark>Gazprom</mark> adopted this line of argument. Not by chance, by mid-2004,the
single most insistent lobbyist in favour of the agreement was <mark>Gazprom</mark>.</P><H2><STRONG><mark>Gazprom</mark> gains</STRONG></H2><P><mark>Gazprom</mark>
gained from Kyoto for a number of reasons. Firstly, the company saw the so-called Joint Implementation (JI)
projects as a cheap way of rehabilitating the company through foreign
investments. In 2006, one of <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s first pilot energy-savings projects was
implemented in cooperation with the German company Ruhrgas AG for the optimisation
of gas pipelines and the reduction of fuel gas waste.</P><P><SPAN class=""wysiwyg_imageupload image imgupl_floating_none caption-xlarge""><SPAN class=""image_meta""><SPAN class=""image_title"">A gas flame burns at a gas refinery. Imagine by: Kokhanchikov via Shutterstock (c)</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P>Secondly,
the industry knew that it could make profits from <mark>carbon</mark> trading due to
Russia's generous emissions targets, especially with the help of improvements
in energy efficiency from JI investment. Since Russia’s energy sector is
notoriously <mark>carbon</mark> intensive, it had vast potential for energy-saving
improvements. </P><P>Thirdly,
<mark>Gazprom</mark> looked forward to an increase in sales of natural gas that, as an environmentally-friendly fuel, would be in high demand from other European Kyoto signatories. An
EU study estimated that the initialisation of the EU Emissions Trading System
alone could boost European demand for natural gas by as much as 6% in the
period 2008–2012, since fuel switching is one of the cheaper short-term options
for industrial enterprises to meet their <mark>CO2</mark> emission caps. As
witnessed by the EU’s present day de-<mark>carbon</mark>isation policy, the centre-piece of
which is natural gas, these expectations have proven correct. </P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark>
also had reputational incentives to support the <mark>climate</mark> regime: on its website,
<mark>Gazprom</mark> listed a range of energy-saving measures, including the optimisation of
transmission system gas flow, the replacement of gas compressor units, and the
implementation of automated control systems, all of which had the goal of
simultaneously improving its image and attracting foreign investment.</P><P>Although
technically controlled by the state, <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s influence inside the Presidential
Administration has always been considerable. In fact, one of the priorities of
the government is to assure the outside world that <mark>Gazprom</mark> conducts its
business effectively, a necessity given the extraordinary amount of rents it
provides for the state. </P><P>Among
the insiders, Dmitry Medvedev (at the time Chairman of <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s Board of Directors)
was also Vladimir Putin’s Chief of Staff, and thus a particularly influential
figure. Russia’s flirtation with Kyoto may have been the consequence of
Medvedev’s policy priorities, which in turn were closely related to <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s
economic incentives.</P><H2><STRONG>Political fanfare </STRONG></H2><P>As
soon as Medvedev became president in 2008, he signed a decree increasing energy
efficiency. Yet, the main instrument for achieving this goal of reduced energy
usage in the economy would be the gradual increase of regulated domestic prices
on gas, a scheme that, once again, suited the interests of <mark>Gazprom</mark> far more
than it promoted energy-saving technologies.</P><P class=""pullquote-right"">As with many other Medvedev initiatives, the action plan remained on the level of political fanfare.</P><P>Moreover,
in May 2009, Russia officially adopted a <mark>Climate</mark> Doctrine, which committed the
country to eradicating the sources of <mark>climate change</mark> in its ‘own way’.
Initially, it was hoped that Medvedev’s energy-efficiency plan would offer real
potential for reducing greenhouse gases. Yet, as with many other Medvedev
initiatives, the action plan remained on the level of political fanfare rather
than a practical policy document. At the time of writing, the <mark>Climate</mark> Doctrine
has no legal standing and has not provided any concrete measures to mitigate
<mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>In
sum, Russia expected its <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by 2008 to decrease by 20% from 1990 levels.  In 2010, the country’s <mark>carbon</mark> emissions stood at 34.2 % below
their 1990 level – a notable track record. However, these reductions had not
been the outcome of focused policies to cut emissions. The decrease in
emissions was principally due to the economic decline that followed Russia’s
transition to a market economy after the collapse of the Soviet system. The
economic downturn shuttered factories, shrunk agriculture, and the re-growth of
forests sequestered more <mark>carbon</mark>.</P><P>But
the same card cannot be played in perpetuity. After Russia joined  the WTO in 2012, there were no further
incentives that would keep it on board. In fact, as of 2011, Russia gave notice
it would not enter into the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.
Moscow’s preference, shared by Japan and Canada, is for a new global agreement
that obliges all major emitters to participate, meaning that today the Kyoto
protocol covers no more than 16% of global emissions. </P><H2><STRONG>Agency and redemption </STRONG></H2><P>The success of the US-China
declaration on <mark>climate</mark>, raises hopes for the upcoming Paris <mark>climate</mark> talks, but
it also demonstrates two important points. Firstly, the Chinese Communist Party
has staked its legitimacy and political survival on raising the environmental
standards of average Chinese. Secondly, Obama is taking great pains to restore
his fortunes and reinvigorate his presidency; and <mark>climate policy</mark> is one aspect.</P><P>Most recently, at the UN’s latest round of
<mark>climate</mark> talks in Lima, Russia surprised many observers by strongly supporting
the draft for a new global deal, to be signed
in Paris, in a year. Putting rhetoric to one side, Russia has continued
with negotiations as is usual by choosing to remain isolated, and letting the US, China,
and India take the lion’s share of the blame for the current lack of progress. </P><P class=""pullquote-right"">Russia has shown very little
agency in the <mark>climate</mark> battle  </P><P>But now, with
China finally ready to work on <mark>climate change</mark>, India has become the
single-biggest wild card ahead of the Paris talks in December 2015. At present,
India has adopted an intransigent position on further
emission reductions. But if <mark>climate</mark> negotiators want a truly global agreement,
they will have to bring India on board. </P><P>In this constellation, there
is some room for Russian redemption. A decade after talking about becoming
a ‘great ecological power’, the country has shown very little agency in the
<mark>climate</mark> battle and has left the international <mark>climate</mark> community generally
unimpressed. However,
if Russia’s declared plan to cut emissions is genuine, the country could restore its international
standing by attracting followers in the BRICS, especially by enticing India,
which Putin has been courting since the escalation of geopolitical
tensions with the West. Undoubtedly,
Putin’s new-found relationship with Narendra Modi is strongly related to
Russia’s power struggle over Ukraine.<SPAN> </SPAN></P><P>

Despite this underlying geopolitical motivation, if cosy relations between Russia and
India result in a change of New Delhi’s stance on <mark>climate change</mark>, Moscow will regain
some legitimacy in the <mark>climate</mark> battle, and perhaps find that it has given the world
some hope in this fractious period of renewed tension.</P><P><EM>Standfirst Image: <mark>Gazprom</mark> offices in Russia.

                    [post_content] =&gt; With European gas import demand having risen substantially since 2014, <mark>Gazprom</mark> has dramatically increased its sales on the European market. In Q1 2018, <mark>Gazprom</mark> reported record daily gas exports to Europe in late February and early March. This Comment addresses the question of how those volumes were delivered to the market, and the extent to which the infrastructure for delivery of those volumes was used,  highlighting that, in times of peak European gas import demand, full utilisation of the Nord Stream and Yamal-Europe pipelines left Ukraine as the only transit route with spare capacity. Until Nord Stream 2 and Turkish Stream are built, <mark>Gazprom</mark> will remain dependent on gas transit via Ukraine throughout the year, with Ukraine providing substantial flows in summer as European gas storage facilities are refilled, and a combination of significant flows and additional spare capacity in the winter peak demand period.

                    [post_content] =&gt; The arrival of the first Russian LNG supplies to the UK coincided with the deterioration of UK-Russia diplomatic relations, triggering debates over the role of Russia in UK hydro<mark>carbon</mark> imports. Although Russia is the largest supplier of UK coal imports, coal is being phased out of UK energy consumption. Russia is just one of several substantial suppliers of crude oil and refined oil products to the UK, with levels of UK oil demand being strongly linked to developments in the UK transportation fuel mix. By contrast, natural gas is the largest source of UK heat and power generation, and underpins non-transportation sector energy consumption. UK gas import demand is currently largely met by pipeline imports from Norway and LNG imports from Qatar. However, as the UK seeks to cope with fluctuations in domestic gas demand through increased LNG imports and gas trade with north-western Europe, following the closure of the UK’s only seasonal gas storage facility, the challenge to UK energy security is not dependence on Russian gas supplies but rather increasing exposure to international gas market volatility.

                    [post_content] =&gt; <mark>Gazprom</mark> has confounded many expectations by enjoying two record years of gas sales in Europe in 2016 and 2017. External factors have certainly played a role in its success, with overall European demand rebounding, indigenous production continuing to fall and alternative sources of imports failing to deliver at the expected levels (especially LNG). In addition, <mark>Gazprom</mark> has demonstrated  a level of flexibility in its pricing strategy that has kept its gas very competitive, with the result that its market share in Europe has grown to 35%. However, the anticipation that this figure could rise towards 40% and above has led EU politicians and policy-makers to become concerned about over-dependence on Russian gas, and many now wish to ensure that <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s future options are limited by obstructing potential new pipelines. In addition the politics surrounding Ukraine, the imposition of stricter US sanctions, questions surrounding  the DG COMP investigation into <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s activities and the Stockholm arbitration ruling over contracts with Ukraine add further layers of complexity. This paper therefore explores whether <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s two <EM>anni mirabiles</EM> in 2016 and 2017 can be repeated or whether Russian gas faces a more challenging environment in the rest of the decade.
                    [post_title] =&gt; <mark>Gazprom</mark> in Europe – two “Anni Mirabiles”, but can it continue?

The first, published Monday morning by The Guardian, suggested USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service has instructed staff during the Trump era to avoid use of the term “<mark>climate change</mark>.” It drew an immediate repudiation from USDA. The second was an unpublished government report on <mark>climate change</mark>, leaked to and published by The New York Times, that placed human activity at the center of a rise in temperatures in the U.S. since 1980 that has made recent decades the warmest in the past 1,500 years.</P><P class=""story-continued"">Story Continued Below</P><P>From a headline perspective, anyway, when it rains it pours. The Guardian published a <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/07/usda-<mark>climate</mark>-change-language-censorship-emails"" target=""_blank"">series of emails</A> by career officials at the conservation service, indicating that using the term “<mark>climate change</mark>” was a no-no and that “weather extremes” should be used instead. The phrase “build organic soil matter,” the emails revealed, was preferred to “reduce greenhouse gases.” The Feb. 16 memo from Bianca Moebius-Clune, director of NRCS’ soil health division, also instructed staff to talk about how soil health increases opportunities for economic and business growth and production efficiency.</P><P><B>USDA officials were quick to push back.</B> USDA spokesman Tim Murtaugh told MA in a phone interview that “there has never been a directive to NRCS regarding the term ‘<mark>climate change</mark>’” and that it was unclear why the career officials behind the memos had raised the issue to staff. A spokesman for NRCS in an email backed Murtaugh’s response. “The Natural Resources Conservation Service has not received direction from USDA or the administration to modify its communications on <mark>climate change</mark> or any other topic,” the spokesman said.</P><P><B>Internet check:</B> It was unclear whether NRCS officials have curbed use of the term “<mark>climate change</mark>” since earlier this year. A quick search on the department’s website found that USDA’s conservation arm still has a page on the issue that highlights adaptation and mitigation efforts. “<mark>Climate change</mark> poses environmental, social, and agricultural challenges that require adaptation measures to help human and natural systems adjust to new or changing climatic patterns,” NRCS says on the <A href=""https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/<mark>climate</mark>change/"" target=""_blank"">site</A>. </P><P><B><mark>Climate change</mark> eggshells:</B> The Trump administration’s stance on <mark>climate change</mark> and actions on scientific issues has the environmental and scientific community permanently on edge, so it’s not surprising that the emails — which don’t seem to include any transition officials — would cause a stir. President Donald Trump has long questioned the existence of <mark>climate change</mark>, once calling it a “hoax” perpetuated by the Chinese, and has been mum on whether he thinks it is <A href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/01/trump-<mark>climate</mark>-change-belief-239037"" target=""_blank"">caused by humans</A>. The Trump administration has pulled the U.S. out of the Paris <mark>climate</mark> deal and changed <mark>climate</mark>-change-related webpages for EPA and other government agencies to reflect its skepticism about the science.</P><P><B>HAPPY TUESDAY, AUGUST 8! </B>Welcome to Morning Ag, where your host is admittedly a little grumpy about being back in D.C. but very thankful for cleaner air. Smoke from wildfires in British Columbia has <A href=""http://www.tri-cityherald.com/news/local/article165660972.html"" target=""_blank"">engulfed much of Washington state</A> for the past week. The air quality is still <A href=""https://fortress.wa.gov/ecy/enviwa/"" target=""_blank"">quite bad</A> across much of the state. You know the deal: Thoughts, news, tips?

The <A href=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_academy_of_sciences/index.html?inline=nyt-org"" target=""_blank"">National Academy of Sciences</A> has signed off on the draft and is awaiting permission from the Trump administration to release it,” the report said.</P><P>The document states it is “extremely likely” that more than half of global average temperature increases can be “linked” to human activities. The Times report also suggested scientists within the federal government are worried the Trump administration would suppress the report.

But we know Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue will be sticking by the pick as the nomination battle plays out. </P><P>Perdue on Monday defended Clovis when questioned by reporters about controversial comments Clovis made in 2011 and 2012 on a <A href=""https://www.politicopro.com/agriculture/story/2017/08/clovis-targets-progressives-socialist-barack-obama-in-old-blog-posts-160407"" target=""_blank"">since-deleted blog</A>, and said the CNN report that brought the statements to light was nothing more than a smear campaign. He also shot down criticism that Clovis is not qualified for the post. The administration has <A href=""https://www.politicopro.com/energy/story/2017/07/the-sam-clovis-factor-160036"" target=""_blank"">taken heat on the left</A> for nominating Clovis to a position that by law must be drawn from “among distinguished scientists with specialized training or significant experience in agricultural research, education and economics.”</P><P>“I don’t necessarily buy the issue that you have to be [a scientist] to manage that field and guide our capabilities,” Perdue said. “This person that is undersecretary of [research, education and economics] is not going to be doing basic applied research. That’s not what the job calls for.” Clovis has a Ph.D. in public administration. He taught business, management and public policy at Morningside College, a small liberal arts school in Iowa. He was an early supporter of Trump’s campaign, serving as co-chair and policy adviser.</P><P><B>Perdue’s comments were the first public response from the administration</B> after the CNN report last week, which highlighted how Clovis once called progressives “liars, race-traders and race-’traitors’” and accused labor unions of coming out of the “Communist closet” to support President Barack Obama. Perdue told reporters he was unfamiliar with those remarks, but accused the media of taking part in an effort to tear Clovis down. “That’s what the opposition does … they dredge up these stories,” he said. </P><P>Perdue said he would work to ease concerns over Clovis — a <mark>climate change</mark> skeptic — arguing that he trusts him to ensure the department engages in sound science. &quot;I fully support his nomination,” Perdue said. “I’ll do everything I can in the confirmation process.” </P><P><B>PERDUE LOOKS TO INDUSTRY FOR DICAMBA FIX:</B> Perdue doesn’t want to have to get involved in finding a solution for how to keep certain formulations of dicamba used on Monsanto’s Roundup Ready Xtend crops from damaging neighboring crops. “I’m hoping that the industry itself and the producers themselves are working toward a resolution,” the secretary told reporters Monday. “I would much prefer that method rather than a prescriptive, top-down regulation.”</P><P>Thousands of complaints have been filed across the Southeast and Midwest — <A href=""http://www.aad.arkansas.gov/arkansas-dicamba-information-updates"" target=""_blank"">Arkansas</A> alone has had 845 — by farmers who say their crops have been damaged by drift from the highly volatile herbicide. The situation has gotten so bad that some states have banned the herbicide, and a group of soybean and watermelon farmers filed <A href=""http://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/arkansasmatters/document_dev/2017/06/15/Dicamba%20Complaint%20-%20Class%20Action_1497537976264_22796036_ver1.0.pdf"" target=""_blank"">suit</A> in federal court against Monsanto and BASF, which makes the herbicide, to recoup profits lost due to spoiled crops. Last week, Monsanto <A href=""https://monsanto.com/products/product-stewardship/articles/to-our-farmer-customers/"" target=""_blank"">said</A> it is taking the situation “extremely seriously.” It said it will offer support to farmers who have experienced problems with their crops and work to better educate growers of Roundup Ready Xtend crops.</P><P><B>PERDUE PREPS FOR NAFTA REWRITE: </B>Perdue plans on being in D.C. next week when formal NAFTA renegotiation talks begin. The secretary told reporters Monday that he will be engaged in the conversation, and he’ll work with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on ag issues. </P><P>There are a few areas where Perdue wants to see changes — easing controls on Canadian dairy and timber and Mexican pork, for example — but his focus will be on protecting agriculture. “The mantra I’ve continued to promulgate in the White House is first of all, do no harm to ag,” Perdue said.</P><P><B>ROAD TRIP FUEL: </B>Perdue wraps up his “Back to Our Roots” road trip across the Midwest in Indianapolis today with an event at Colt’s training camp to promote good nutrition and then a visit to the Indiana State fair. All told, Perdue’s RV will have covered more than 1,000 miles across five states, with a host of stops each day to get feedback from farmers and agribusiness on the farm bill and rural issues. While the secretary and his staff are digesting all of the information they received, MA had to ask: What does the head of the U.S. food production system eat on a road trip? Though Perdue and his staff captured a lot of the trip on Twitter, his meals were largely undocumented, with the exception of this <A href=""https://twitter.com/SecretarySonny/status/894322707445284864/photo/1"" target=""_blank"">mammoth cinnamon roll</A> in Davenport, Iowa, and a <A href=""https://twitter.com/SecretarySonny/status/893160289339920384/photo/1"" target=""_blank"">burger</A> enjoyed while chatting with farmers in Wisconsin. </P><P>A USDA spokesman tells MA that the RV was stocked with Coke products, nuts, fruit — specifically oranges, apples and bananas — and granola bars. The most popular items: Soy-and-wasabi-flavored almonds and cream puffs acquired at the Wisconsin state fair.</P><P><B>You can take the secretary out of Georgia, but ... : </B>Perdue gave a shout-out to one of his home state’s most iconic products in a <A href=""https://twitter.com/SecretarySonny/status/894602240492744705/photo/1"" target=""_blank"">tweet</A> following a farm bill discussion with Illinois Agriculture Director Raymond Poe and members of the Illinois Farm Bureau on Monday. “Got to peel back stifling regulations like a sweet Vidalia onion, one layer at a time. <A href=""https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BackToOurRoots"" target=""_blank"">#BackToOurRoots</A> tour in Rochester, Illinois.” </P><P><B>VEGAN GROUP PETITIONS USDA OVER MYPLATE: </B>The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a vegan advocacy group made up of thousands of doctors,is filing a petition this week that will urge USDA to nix the focus on protein and dairy in its federal nutrition advice. MyPlate, which replaced the Food Pyramid under the Obama administration, currently recommends a quadrant of the plate be filled with protein. It also recommends dairy on the side. PCRM argues that instead of protein, which can be found in vegetables and grains, the protein quadrant should instead promote the “legumes food group.”</P><P>“MyPlate should focus only on essential food groups,” the petition says. “Vegetables, fruits, grains, and legumes are staples available in all grocery stores and familiar to all Americans. Together these four food groups provide the nutrients necessary for a healthful diet that maintains a healthy body weight and prevents disease.”</P><P><B>EGG SCANDAL EXPANDS IN EUROPE: </B>Eggs contaminated with the insecticide fipronil may have been sold in some seven countries, POLITICO EU reported Monday. Per our colleagues across the Atlantic: “Dutch authorities said in late July that they had shut poultry farms after finding high levels of fipronil — an insecticide banned for use on farm animals because of its danger to human health — in batches of eggs. A Belgian company is under investigation for creating an illegal mite-killer containing fipronil. Belgium launched an investigation in June, but did not notify the European Commission until July. Germany, which receives Dutch egg shipments, launched its own investigation in July.” More <A href=""http://www.politico.eu/article/brussels-warns-egg-scandal-could-now-involve-seven-countries/?utm_content=buffer47d41&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer"" target=""_blank"">here</A>. </P><P><B>MA’S INSTANT OATS:</B></P><P>— Sen. <A href=""https://cd.politicopro.com/member/140963"" target=""_blank"">Elizabeth Warren</A> has put a hold on the nomination of Makan Delrahim, Trump’s pick to run DOJ’s antitrust division, over her concerns that he would be pro-consolidation, Bloomberg <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-07/trump-s-pick-for-antitrust-chief-is-said-to-be-blocked-by-warren"" target=""_blank"">reports</A>. </P><P>— The widely held belief that poor people eat more junk food than rich people is not true, so say two academics in this <A href=""https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/7/16011002/junk-food-rich-poor-people"" target=""_blank"">Vox</A> piece. </P><P>— Is John Kelly as White House chief of staff good news for agriculture?

However, Cargill is both a major importer of palm oil into the U.S., and has a two-part business model in the palm oil industry: it both owns and operates palm oil plantations in Indonesia and it purchases and trades palm oil and its derivatives worldwide. Cargill’s palm oil problem stretches far beyond its own plantations.</P><P>While it is true that progress can, and should, be made to reduce the impacts of its own plantations, the real human and environmental costs of Cargill’s palm oil business is in the actions of its suppliers in plantations where oil palm fruit is planted and grown. More spin than substance, Cargill fails to come clean about the real and ongoing impacts of its supply chain in its new video. Overly focusing on its own plantations, Cargill admits the true nature of its palm oil supply chain almost as an aside, briefly stating in its report, “we source primarily from third-party suppliers.”</P><P style=""text-align: left;"">Cargill first committed to eliminate palm oil suppliers associated with deforestation, degradation of <mark>carbon</mark>-rich peatlands and human and worker rights’ violations in September 2014. Since then, little progress has been made to drive real change on the ground in Indonesia, Malaysia and Latin America, where a majority of the palm oil Cargill buys and sells is produced. Take for example, the following cases where serious environmental and social impacts remain: <STRONG>Problem: Land grabbing and Human Rights Abuse</STRONG></P><P>The practice of land grabbing occurs when palm oil companies seize community land for the further development of plantations. Over the past years, <A href=""http://www.ran.org/palm_oil_giant_kuala_lumpur_kepong_berhad_klk_plagued_by_ongoing_conflict_and_exploitation_new_progress_report_finds"" target=""_blank"">Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad (KLK)</A>, a known supplier to Cargill, has attempted to pursue development in Collingwood Bay, Papua New Guinea, and Grand Bassa County, Liberia, despite active opposition and lack of Free, Prior and Informed Consent from local communities.</P><P>Grupo Olmeca, and its subsidiary <A href=""http://www.ran.org/alarming_developments_in_latin_american_palm_oil_industry_spur_global_call_to_action_for_palm_oil_traders"" target=""_blank"">REPSA</A>, is a major palm oil company in Guatemala that according to local communities has committed egregious violations of human rights, including the alleged murder of human rights defender Rigoberto Lima Choc, who opposed its operations due to direct impacts on local communities and workers.</P><P>Cargill has failed to take meaningful and transparent actions to remedy the human rights violations of these suppliers, but has instead kept KLK and Grupo Olmeca in the supply chain with little transparency and no accountability.</P><P><STRONG>Problem: Exploitation of Workers</STRONG></P><P>In a recent <A href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/palm-oil-migrant-workers-tell-of-abuses-on-malaysian-plantations-1437933321"" target=""_blank"">Wall Street Journal report</A>, forced labor and human trafficking were exposed in the operations of palm oil giant Felda Global Ventures (FGV)––a known supplier to Cargill in Malaysia where a number of Cargill’s palm oil refineries are located. Rather than admit that problems exist and develop a plan to address them, FGV has denied the accusations, accused the reporter of lying, and attempted cosmetic efforts to ride out the media storm without making any fundamental changes to its labor practices. An inadequate audit commissioned by the Roundtable on <mark>Sustainable</mark> Palm Oil (RSPO) detailed several indicators for forced labor but then failed to actually investigate two of the most critical indicators: the method of recruitment and legal work status of subcontracted workers.</P><P>Cargill has so far failed to commission a skilled labor assessor to independently and transparently verify FGV’s compliance with its policy. Even on its own plantations, Cargill’s efforts toward upholding workers’ rights are weak. In 2015, Cargill undertook a ‘labor pilot’ on its own plantation in West Kalimantan but the findings have not been published.</P><P><STRONG>Problem: Deforestation Of Endangered Species Habitat and <mark>Carbon</mark> Rich Peatlands</STRONG></P><P>Cargill has failed to enforced a moratorium on forest and peatland clearance in the operations of its suppliers and new acquisitions, such as the <A href=""http://www.greenomics.org/docs/IPOP_Implementation_Report-05_Greenomics.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Polipant Group</A>. Palm oil expansion continues to drive deforestation in the 6.5 million acre global biodiversity hotspot known as <A href=""http://www.ran.org/lastplaceonearth"" target=""_blank"">The Leuser Ecosystem</A>. Located in Aceh on the island of Sumatra, it is the last place on Earth where Sumatran orangutan, tiger, elephant, rhino and sunbear coexist in the wild, and the companies responsible for the destruction of rainforests and peatlands in the area sell palm oil to Cargill’s key global suppliers.</P><P>Sadly, a devastating annual forest fire season has become the norm in Indonesia, as fires intentionally set to cheaply clear land for new plantations rage out of control. Cargill has posted maps of the fires in its own concessions as a way to appear like it is taking action to address its contribution to the fires which burn across Indonesia and blanket the skies of local villages and cities, as well as those cities across Southeast Asia, with toxic smoke each year. The fires are huge drivers of <mark>climate change</mark>, disrupt air traffic, provoke public health emergencies and trigger diplomatic crisis among Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Cargill will not be able to guarantee that it is not sourcing palm oil from plantations where fires are ablaze until it requires all its suppliers to publish all concession maps and enforce a moratorium on the clearance of forests and peatlands across their entire operations.</P><P>What’s more, Cargill’s efforts to halt deforestation have taken a step backward as it supports and plans to trial the <A href=""http://www.ran.org/ran_statement_on_the_final_high_<mark>carbon</mark>_stock_science_study"" target=""_blank"">High <mark>Carbon</mark> Stock (HCS+) Study</A>. The so-called “High <mark>Carbon</mark> Stock+” model will allow further clearance of forests and peatlands and includes a dangerous loophole that allows companies to offset ongoing deforestation in palm oil concession areas through setting aside forests in other landholdings. Its proposal to use ‘offsets’ and a ‘<mark>carbon</mark> neutral approach’ in the implementation of “No Deforestation” commitments has been criticized by many NGOs. If implemented, Cargill will continue to drive further destruction of important forests and the expansion of the flawed, industrial concession palm oil plantation model, aggressively developed in Indonesia and Malaysia into other frontier regions.</P><P><STRONG>Problem: Lack of Transparency and Accountability</STRONG></P><P>While Cargill has begun issuing regular progress reports in an effort to update its customers and critics these reports lack the details needed to demonstrate whether or not real progress is being made on the forest frontlines of palm oil expansion and in existing plantations growing the palm oil Cargill currently sells.</P><P>Cargill has not yet made public the names and locations of all of its suppliers in its global supply chain; its non-compliance protocols or the names of suppliers it has dropped; or data on the proportion of its suppliers that have been verified by an independent third-party as compliant with its policy. Cargill has established a grievance procedure, but has failed to ensure that it meets international norms for truly independent grievance mechanisms and the company currently fails to recognize and demand the resolution of outstanding social conflicts in its supply chain.</P><P>These cases demonstrate that more action is needed before Cargill can claim to be “responsible.” Cargill must stop misrepresenting the progress it has actually made, come clean on the ongoing impacts of its global palm oil supply chain and start taking real action to address the serious social and environmental consequences of its palm oil business.</P><P>Cargill’s business lines touch all aspects of palm oil production, trade, refining and marketing as it moves palm oil from producers to end consumers. The palm oil giant has a crucial role to play in building traceable and responsible palm oil sourcing from growers to markets. With your help, Rainforest Action Network will demand real action, not just lip service, and continue to hold Cargill to account for the impacts of its global demand for commodities, including palm oil.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,2.0,Strongly Negative

This paper focused on their impact on <mark>climate change</mark> and estimated the <mark>carbon</mark> footprint of commercial and home-made sandwiches. The study also explored how the information on the <mark>carbon</mark> footprint could be combined with nutritional data to assist consumers in making more informed food choices. In total, 40 different recipes were considered, focusing on most popular consumer choices in the UK. The estimated impact from ready-made sandwiches ranges from 739 g <mark>CO2</mark> eq. for egg &amp; cress to 1441 g <mark>CO2</mark> eq. for the bacon, sausage &amp; egg option. The <mark>carbon</mark> footprint of the most popular home-made sandwich (ham &amp; cheese) varies from 399–843 g <mark>CO2</mark> eq. per sandwich, depending on the recipe. The average impact from the home-made option is around two times lower than the impact from the ready-made equivalent with the same ingredients. The greatest contributor to the <mark>carbon</mark> footprint of both types of sandwich is the agricultural production of ingredients; for ready-made sandwiches, the preparation and retail stages are also significant. Various improvement options were considered through 22 scenarios, including changes in the cultivation of ingredients, recipe changes, reduction of food waste, alternative packaging and different waste management options. The findings suggest that reductions in the <mark>carbon</mark> footprint of up to 50% are possible for ready-made sandwiches. The greatest improvement opportunities lie in reducing post-consumer waste; however, these are most difficult to realise as they involve changing consumer behaviour.</DIV></DIV><DIV class=""request-fulltext-promo pdf""><DIV class=""nova-o-media-object nova-o-media-object--gutter-m nova-o-media-object--vertical-align-middle""><DIV class=""nova-o-media-object__item nova-o-media-object__item--width-full""><P class=""nova-e-text nova-e-text--size-l nova-e-text--family-sans-serif nova-e-text--spacing-auto nova-e-text--color-inherit"">Do you want to <STRONG>read the rest</STRONG> of this article?</P><BUTTON class=""nova-c-button nova-c-button--align-center nova-c-button--radius-m nova-c-button--size-s nova-c-button--color-blue nova-c-button--theme-solid nova-c-button--width-auto ga-fulltext-request-new-promo"" type=""button""><SPAN class=""nova-c-button__label"">Request full-text</SPAN></BUTTON></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1.0,0.0,

They are feeding on stale bread, rotting mangoes, overripe cantaloupe and squishy zucchini. </P><P>But this is no garbage dump. It’s a farm. </P><P>Enterra Feed, one of an emerging crop of insect growers, will process the bugs into protein-rich food for fish, poultry - even pets. After being fattened up, the fly larvae will be roasted, dried and bagged or pressed to extract oils, then milled into a brown powder that smells like roasted peanuts. </P><P>The small but growing insect farming sector has captured attention and investments from some heavyweights in the $400 billion-a-year animal feed business, including U.S. agricultural powerhouse <mark>Cargill Inc</mark> [CARG.UL], feed supplier and farm products and services company Wilbur-Ellis Co and Swiss-based Buhler Group, which makes crop processing machinery. </P><P>Fast food giant McDonald’s is studying using insects for chicken feed to reduce reliance on soy protein.  </P><P>“This pioneering work is currently at the proof-of-concept stage,” Nicola Robinson, McDonald’s Corp <mark>sustainable</mark> supply chain manager, told Reuters. “We are encouraged by initial results and are committed to continuing to support further research.”</P><P>The fact that such global food production giants are turning to insects illustrates the lengths they will go to find alternative sources of protein that are profitable and <mark>sustainable</mark> as animal feed or additives to human food. Bugs are just one many alternatives being studied or developed by major agricultural firms. Others include peas, canola, algae and bacterial proteins. </P><P>Global population growth and an expanding middle class have raised per capita meat consumption by 50 percent over the past four decades, fueling fears of a protein pinch. Traditional sources of the key macronutrient are growing increasingly unreliable amid a changing global <mark>climate</mark> and worries about the environmental impacts of row-crop farms and commercial fishing. </P><P>(For a graphic on rising meat consumption, see: <A href=""https://tmsnrt.rs/2INBgFY"">tmsnrt.rs/2INBgFY</A> ) </P><P>Benoit Anquetil - strategy and technology lead for Cargill’s animal nutrition business - called developing new sources of protein a “long-term opportunity.”</P><P>“<mark>Sustainable</mark> protein is a key challenge, which is why Cargill is evaluating the viability of insects as part of the solution to nourish the world,” Anquetil said. </P><P>People tend to pivot from grain- and plant-based diets to meat-based meals as they grow wealthier. The problem is that as meat demand grows, feed production needs to grow faster. It typically takes about two pounds of feed to produce a pound of chicken. For pork, it takes four pounds. </P><P>Expanded cultivation of soybeans - the foundation of livestock and poultry rations for decades - is not a long term solution because it contributes to deforestation and overuse of harsh farm chemicals. </P><P>In addition, supplies of fishmeal - an aquaculture feed made from wild-caught fish and fish by-products - have fluctuated wildly with climactic cycles, overfishing and regulation to prevent it. </P><P>Nutritionists and scientists have long touted insect consumption for humans as a <mark>sustainable</mark> and cheap source of protein, but snacking on bugs is a stomach-churning prospect for people in many countries and cultures. Introducing insect protein further down the food chain may be more palatable. </P><P>The bug business still has a few hurdles ahead - like the yuck factor, even when the insects are fed to animals. Regulators will also need to be convinced that ground-up bugs won’t introduce new toxins into the food supply. </P><P>“They are considered filth in the food system,” said Virginia Emery, CEO of Beta Hatch, which grows mealworms above an auto body shop near Seattle-Tacoma Airport. </P><H3>FEEDING BUGS TO FISH </H3><P>Cargill conducted an insect-based feed trial on poultry in 2015, but the company’s efforts with insects have since focused on bolstering its growing aquaculture business, where demand for alternative proteins is most acute. </P><P>Beta Hatch is chasing the same market. The small company’s mealworms - larvae of the mealworm beetle - will likely end up as fish food as Emery expands her business with the help of an investment from Wilbur Ellis, whose fish-farming customers have pressed for <mark>sustainable</mark> alternatives to fishmeal. </P><P>“Fishmeal has a limited supply, and aquaculture is continuing to grow,” said Andrew Loder, president of Wilbur Ellis’ feed division. “We see insect meal as one piece of a solution.”</P><P>Fish farming is growing fast with growing consumer demand and increasing concerns about overfishing, resulting in catch restrictions in many depleted fisheries. Warming oceans in some areas have also disrupted supplies. </P><P>That means fish eaten by humans will increasingly come from farms - driving up demand and prices for fish feed. </P><DIV class=""container_1tVQo"" tabindex=""-1""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption_KoNH1""><SPAN>Black soldier fly larvae at the Enterra Feed Corporation in Langley, British Columbia, Canada, March 14, 2018.

Black soldier fly larvae also contain high levels of calcium and iron and can feed on a broad array of food waste.  </P><P>Crickets - a favorite for human consumption in some countries - are by contrast picky eaters. They’re also noisy, and can damage nearby crops if they escape. </P><P>Enterra is expanding to a second commercial-scale plant in Calgary within the next year and targeting opening similar facilities in other North American cities every year for the next five years, with financing from Calgary-based Avrio Capital and UK-based Wheat Sheaf. </P><P>Protix opened its first commercial black soldier fly larvae plant in the Netherlands in 2017 and will break ground on a second facility there later this year, aided by a $50 million investment from Buhler. The Dutch company, working with fish farmers, has also launched a brand of “friendly salmon,” fed with rations containing insect meal instead of fishmeal. </P><P>“If we are able to be successful in Europe, then this will be a global solution,” said Protix CEO Kees Aarts. </P><P>    Neither company would disclose the production costs or capacity, citing proprietary technology. But both said their insect feed prices are on par with to slightly above competing feeds like fishmeal. </P><P>Ohio-based EnviroFlight, a black soldier fly larvae producer, will break ground on the first commercial-scale insect meal production facility in the United States near Cincinnati later this year. </P><H3>    REGULATORY HURDLES </H3><P>    Humans have been eating insects for centuries, but the practice is not common in many western cultures and still spooks food regulators. </P><P>Black soldier fly larvae production has gained a handful of approvals in Europe, Canada and the United States, mostly for use in fish farms. Poultry, swine and pet food regulations are not as far along. </P><P>    “Since fish eat insects in the wild naturally, it is easier for consumers to wrap their heads around insects as part of the feed,” Cargill’s Anquetil said. </P><P>    Thorough safety testing of insects as feed will be critical for consumer acceptance, said Thomas Gremillion, director for the Food Policy Institute at the Consumer Federation of America. </P><P>“If there was a big change in how animals are being fed, I’d want to see some extra scrutiny of whether the animals were accumulating any kinds of toxins from the insects,” he said. </P><P>It will take years for the insect farming sector to scale up. But growing the business to even a small market share would make a big difference to the feed industry and the environment, said Robert Nathan Allen, an insect farmer and chairman of the North American Coalition for Insect Agriculture.  </P><DIV class=""inline-container_1QqKC mega_19SOz""><FIGCAPTION class=""caption_2BUXy"">Slideshow<SPAN class=""count_3OPtf""> (8 Images)</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></DIV><P>“If we’re replacing 5 or 10 percent of the proteins that are normally in those feeds with insect protein,” Allen said, “That’s a lot of resources saved.”</P><DIV class=""container_28wm1""><DIV class=""attribution_o4ojT""><P class=""content_27_rw"">Reporting by Karl Plume in Chicago; Additional reporting by Ben Nelms in Langley, British Columbia; Editing by Simon Webb and Brian Thevenot</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1.0,1.0,Neutral

        In pulling out of the Paris <mark>climate</mark> deal, Trump showed America is a clear and present danger to civilization itself
      </P></DIV></ARTICLE></ASIDE><P>Politicians across the nation, noting that majorities of voters in every single state (even West Virginia!) opposed withdrawing from the pact, pledged to keep up the fight. More than 300 mayors and counting have announced a compact to fight for the goals of the Paris accord, and 12 states (including New York and California and representing more than a third of the nation's economy) formed the U.S. <mark>Climate</mark> Alliance to reach the targets set in the French capital in 2015. In fact, as the director of Canada's <mark>Climate</mark> Action Network said, &quot;Trump's move to withdraw the U.S. from the accord has resulted in the clearest...call for <mark>climate</mark> action from every corner of human civilization yet.&quot;</P><P>Still, one is allowed just the teensiest bit of cynicism when it comes to CEOs and politicians. The head of <mark>Dow Chemical</mark>, for instance, had expressed his &quot;disappointment&quot; with Trump, noting in grave CEO-speak that &quot;Leaders don't leave tables. Leaders stay.&quot; It turned out, however, that Dow was a member of a key lobbying group pushing for withdrawal. In Vermont, the hypocrisy was on display the very same day. Republican Gov. Phil Scott, who called the president's decision &quot;concerning,&quot; said the state would join the <mark>Climate</mark> Alliance. And yet, the same afternoon, Scott named as the state's top utility regulator a lawyer who has spent the past few years fighting new wind and solar power. </P><P>All of which is to say, just as physics is unlikely to be intimidated by Trump's bluster, it won't pay any heed to meaningless pledges by politicians. Physics cares about how much <mark>carbon</mark> is in the atmosphere. The time for encouraging messages of support for the <mark>climate</mark> is over – we need action. This has been a problem for years; Democrats in particular have been able to slip by with simple declarations that they &quot;believe&quot; in <mark>climate</mark> science. But at this point, who cares? Certainly not the swift heating planet. We need serious and immediate commitment to action. Here are three simple criteria for determining whether your local politicians are serious enough to pass the <mark>climate</mark> test.</P><P><B> They are committed to converting to 100 percent renewable energy</B>A few years ago, this would have been a hard test, because while it was clear that we needed to drive <mark>carbon</mark> emissions to zero in order to have a chance of slowing down <mark>climate change</mark>, it wasn't clear we had enough alternative power available. Solar and wind were still expensive, and worse, they operated intermittently: When the sun wasn't shining or the wind ceased to blow, you were out of luck. But over the past decade, these technologies have gotten cheaper and more powerful. From Abu Dhabi to Chile to Mexico to India, solar power costs less to produce than any other form of energy; across much of America, wind costs the same as or less than coal-fired power. As of this year, wind and solar account for 10 percent of electricity in the U.S., and that's only a glimmer of our potential. Best of all, the sundown problem is being solved fast, as batteries are able to store the energy from the morning sun and the wind from a gusty evening to keep the power running overnight.</P><P>For years, the research teams at places like Exxon have not just been lying about global warming, they've also been insisting that change must come slowly – that by 2040 the world will still be relying almost entirely on fossil fuel. But <mark>innovation</mark> has badly outrun those predictions. At the end of May, Patrick Lee, a vice president at Sempra Energy, one of the country's biggest utilities, addressed an industry gathering: &quot;I am speaking with confidence....We have a solution now to adjust the intermittency of solar and wind energy that is no longer a technology challenge. Now it is an economic decision.&quot; Three years ago, Lee said, his engineering background made him doubt that 100 percent renewable energy was possible – the grid might always need some coal or gas-fired plants to ensure stability. &quot;But today my answer is: The technology has been resolved. How fast do you want to get to 100 percent? That can be done today.&quot;</P><P class="""">That the management at his Southern California utility reportedly made him walk back the statement two days later only underlines the point: Technological possibility now bumps up against the everlasting power of the fossil-fuel industry. Recent studies have raised questions about where the last few percentage points of that energy may come from a decade or three down the line, but those are technical quibbles: In 2017, 100 percent renewable is the test of whether a politician is serious.</P><P class="""">That's why Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley and Sen. Bernie Sanders introduced a bill in April calling for the 100 percent mark to be reached by 2050 (or, hopefully, sooner – if technological <mark>innovation</mark> continues apace). It obviously won't pass the current Congress, but on a planet where an iceberg the size of Delaware is about to calve from the Antarctic ice shelf, that number is now the minimum standard for <mark>climate</mark> credibility. In the words of the great gospel song/civil-rights anthem, &quot;99 and a half won't do.&quot; The civil-rights theme is no accident, by the way: What was once the environmental movement is now increasingly the <mark>climate</mark>-justice movement, led by communities that are choking on <mark>pollution</mark> and workers who know the next burst of good jobs will come from this renewables build-out.</P><ASIDE class=""inset-image inset-full""><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""credit"">Kayana Szymczak/The New York Times/Redux</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></ASIDE><P class=""""><B>They will work to keep remaining fossil fuels in the ground</B>Since we're committing to 100 percent renewable, there's absolutely no need for any new fossil-fuel infrastructure – no new pipelines, no new frack wells, no new coal mines like the one Trump lauded in his Paris speech. The reason is obvious: If you build them, given the payback time for investments, you're signing up for another four decades of heating the planet. This would seem an obvious test for a <mark>climate</mark>-credible politician – it's been at the heart of the anti-warming movement since at least 2011, when droves of people went off to jail to protest the Keystone XL pipeline. (Full disclosure, I was one of them.)</P><P>The movement has won some of these fights: There are bans on fracking in New York and Maryland; Shell retreated from a proposed drilling operation in Alaska after activists blocked delivery of its rigs; and half a dozen proposed coal ports along the Pacific coast are still unbuilt. Even seeming losses aren't done deals – in June, a federal court ruled that the Dakota Access pipeline hadn't gone through the proper reviews, a big win for the Standing Rock Sioux, who may yet shut the project down. </P><P>What's interesting is how hard it's been to get politicians to help. Republican opposition is easy to understand: The party is a wholly owned subsidiary of the fossil-fuel industry (every time there's a major vote in Congress, Oil Change International- helpfully publishes a list of how much each of the &quot;ayes&quot; has taken from the hydro<mark>carbon</mark> lobby). But too often, Democrats go along as well, even if they're not getting big Texas money. The week before the November election, and the month after security- guards sicced German shepherds on native protesters, Hillary Clinton released this statement about the Dakota pipeline: <I>All of the parties involved – including the federal government, the pipeline company and contractors, the state of North Dakota, and the tribes – need to find a path forward that serves the broadest public interest. </I>For those of us campaigning for her, that waffling didn't make it easy to win votes – but it was at least predictable, because she and other Democrats were under pressure from the unions that like building pipelines. </P><P class="""">It may get easier now for Democrats and progressives to take a stronger stand, because those construction unions have become some of Trump's most uncritical supporters. Two days after the Women's March filled the streets of D.C., the brass from the Building Trades Unions visited the Oval Office, where they had nothing but praise for its new occupant. &quot;We have a common bond with the president,&quot; Sean McGarvey, head of the Building Trades, said. &quot;We come from the same industry.&quot;</P><P class="""">Happily, the other three-quarters of the labor movement has increasingly sided with the communities fighting against <mark>climate change</mark>, in part because it's obvious that renewable energy will supply the jobs of the future. As Naomi Klein wrote in <I>The New York</I><I>Times</I>, &quot;Today labor leaders face a clear choice:&quot; Back bogus pipelines or &quot;join the diverse and growing movement that is confronting Mr. Trump's agenda on every front and attempt to lead America's workers to a clean and safe future.&quot;</P><P class="""">For politicians, that choice is even clearer- – and some have responded. Portland, Oregon, for instance, recently banned any new fossil-fuel infrastructure. Philadelphia has plans to become a fossil-fuel &quot;hub&quot; for the Atlantic seaboard, but a broad coalition of scientists and community groups is putting up a stiff fight. In Virginia, even though he lost the primary, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tom Perriello put a scare into the party's hierarchy with an insurgent candidacy powered by his opposition to two pipelines and his refusal to be bankrolled by the state's utility giant, Dominion Energy – in fact, 61 Democratic- legislative candidates across the state joined Perriello in turning down Dominion campaign cash. </P><ASIDE class=""inset-image inset-full""><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption"">A protest march to a sacred burial ground at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota in September.</SPAN><SPAN class=""credit"">Alyssa Schukar/The New York Times/Redux</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></ASIDE><P><B>They understand natural gas could be the most dangerous fuel of all</B>For the past decade, the democratic get-out-of-jail-free card for dealing with <mark>climate</mark> was natural gas – but as with renewable energy, the passage of time changed the situation enormously. It seemed at first blush a victory when wildcatters began finding vast supplies of natural gas beneath America's soil in the aughts. Because natural gas produces half as much <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide as coal when you burn it in a power plant, President Obama seized on this bounty as both an environmental and economic windfall.</P><P>But two problems soon emerged. One, to get at the gas, you had to frack (that is, explode) the subsurface geology, and soon communities were reporting all kinds of environmental woes – particularly with contaminated groundwater. Second, researchers began to report that the process of producing gas was releasing so much methane (itself a powerful greenhouse gas) into the atmosphere that it was no better for the environment than burning coal. In fact, satellite data suggested that even though <mark>carbon</mark> emissions had fallen as coal-fired power plants closed, the U.S. was venting so much more methane that total greenhouse-gas emissions may have increased during the Obama years. Just as bad, the flood of cheap natural gas retards the necessary swift conversion to sun and wind, which produce no emissions at all. Ten years ago, natural gas was seen as a bridge; now, it's clearly a sharp detour away from renewable energy and toward an ever-hotter future.</P><P>Standing up to natural gas will be hard, because it's where the fossil-fuel industry increasingly concentrates its investments. (Exxon, to the surprise of some, opposed the Paris withdrawal – that's because the company sees its gas business benefiting as <mark>carbon</mark> cuts go into effect but methane is left unregulated.) And it's easy for politicians to play rhetorical games here: If you just talk about &quot;<mark>carbon</mark>,&quot; then gas looks good. But physics, again, is unimpressed by spin. It just adds up all the greenhouse gases in the air, and then it does its thing. Our job is to make sure that truly clean power comes next – we can't waste another few decades playing around with gas.</P><P>So now it's up to the rest of us to make sure this dark moment produces real gain. If we let politicians simply &quot;stand up for science&quot; or promise to someday reincarnate the Paris accord, then we will never catch up with <mark>climate change</mark>. If instead the rage that Trump has provoked catapults us into truly serious action – well, that will be the best revenge. </P><DIV id=""module-more-news""><H3 class=""module-header"">More News</H3></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></SECTION></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></BODY></HTML>",2.0,1.0,Neutral

The DriveNow app launched in London in late December 2014 but has since expanded to Stockholm and Copenhagen, Denmark, as well as a number of cities in Germany, <mark>BMW</mark>’s home country. Partnering with another app will expand <mark>BMW</mark>’s reach and emphasize its environmental awareness to like-minded consumers.“DriveNow’s on-demand car sharing service was always designed to provide city dwellers with another flexible way of getting around, sitting alongside things like public transport, taxis and Boris Bikes rather than replacing them,” said Joseph Seal Driver, director of DriveNow UK. “By partnering with Moovit and integrating DriveNow’s fleet of 290 cars into the app, we’re now helping people to compare every transport option in London at the click of the button.”
As the effects of <mark>climate change</mark> make themselves visible and scientists warn of future damages, the socially minded consumer has looked for ways to minimize her <mark>carbon</mark> footprint. Because of the impact of automobiles on the environment, ride-sharing services have emerged as a popular way of combating <mark>climate change</mark>.
The ride-sharing consumer skews young, so automobile purchase rates have consequently dropped among millennials. As such, automakers hoping to appeal to recent and upcoming luxury consumers have invested in mobility services and electric vehicles with the hopes of attracting young consumers.
With the partnership, Moovit users will be able to rent a car when they need one in accordance with the “pick up anywhere, drop off anywhere” slogan. A map will show all the DriveNow vehicles in the area, which consumers can rent for as long as they wish, with billing by the minute.
Also included within the app are options of finding and renting bicycles, as well as tracking trains and buses.
Moovit operates in 800 cities and more than 60 countries, providing <mark>BMW</mark> with an enormous platform for expansion. At present, most automotive brands have localized mobility sharing available in a small number of cities. This partnership could help <mark>BMW</mark> get out in front and show that automakers can be major players in the mobility service market.
<mark>BMW</mark> was an investor in Moovit’s most recent round of funding. The new relationship thus builds upon the existing sign of faith and helps position <mark>BMW</mark> as an environmentally-friendly option among other automakers.<STRONG>SBD has just released a new analytical report investigating the impacts of innovative mobility and vehicle ownership models on the automotive industry.

And as the Trump administration seeks to play down <mark>climate change</mark>, some states are pushing back. Now, two California cities have brought a lawsuit against the <mark>Chevron</mark> Corporation and other big oil companies, looking to find them responsible for their role in <mark>climate change</mark>. And because the federal judge in the case felt he wasn’t quite up on his <mark>climate</mark> science, he asked each side to teach him how they view the state of the research.</P><P>Molly Peterson was in that courtroom and is here to fill us in on that story. She’s a reporter for KQED Science out there in San Francisco. Thanks for joining us this hour.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Yeah, my pleasure.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: So each side had a different tactic for presenting the <mark>climate</mark> data. Tell us. <mark>Chevron</mark> was the only company, though, representing all the oil companies.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Yeah, that day, he was. So for both sides, the judge wanted both the current state of the science and a kind of history of what they knew, what scientists knew, when they knew it. Each side had two hours to present. The cities turned it over to scientists. The City Attorney was there to introduce scientists to give this story. And <mark>Chevron</mark> used a lawyer to convey its information.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: So what was his argument?</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Well, I mean, he went on the record saying, it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the 20th century. So <mark>Chevron</mark> says, it has been its position for 10 years that it accepts the findings of the IPCC report. But at the same time, <mark>Chevron</mark> was also pointing out and casting doubt wherever it could on how certain scientists were about the influence of humans on <mark>climate change</mark> over this time.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: And so San Francisco and Oakland are the two cities involved in this case. And so they presented their side.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: And their side focused a lot on sea level rise, because obviously, that’s a major concern in California. And I should say that this is part of this growing body of cases, not just San Francisco and Oakland, but the city of Richmond, San Mateo County, Imperial, Beach in Southern California, these other cities are also suing using different legal strategies that one historian of science kind of told me reminded him of the tobacco lawsuits.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: Yeah. And so, they’re upset, of course, that if the oceans are rising, they’re going to be underwater. And they can show, then, that there is actual money damages that are going to occur to their cities.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: That’s right. I mean, in San Francisco in particular, they’re talking about billions of dollars, including, I think, a $350 million bond that might be on the ballot there later this year. The city’s got engineers and consultants out there, trying to figure out what would happen to the Embarcadero along San Francisco. So yeah, they are connecting it to that.</P><P>And so, the presence of IPCC science and scientists was interesting and important, because the most recent IPCC was 2013, 2014. The end of the data for that report was 2012. And a lot has happened in sea level rise science since then.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: Now, I understand this isn’t the first time that this judge has done research for a court case.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: No, it’s not. And he doesn’t do it exclusively in science. But he did it for LIDAR in a case involving self-driving cars. He did it for DACA recently. He’s famous for having taught himself how to program in Basic, and for learning a few lines of Java for a case involving Oracle.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: Wow. So where does this head? This is not the actual court case itself, right?</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: It’s not. In fact, <mark>Chevron</mark> was kind of subtly trying to make this argument that it is also filed with the court a motion to dismiss. <mark>Chevron</mark> says, this is a global problem. It needs a global solution. So even though they’re saying that human activity contributed to this, they say that they’re beyond the reach of this court. So the judge still has to rule on that.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: So do all of the oil companies agree with what <mark>Chevron</mark> is saying?</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Well, at the of the hearing, the judge looked at the other oil companies and said, do you agree with everything this guy said? And they all kind of sat there. And he said, well, you can have two weeks, which is up just about now, for them to weigh in on every single word that was said. So he said to them, his message was clear, you can’t get away sitting here in silence.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: So there’s going to be a lot more we’re going to hear about this, as it moves forward.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Yeah.

Eddie Bernice Johnson recently held an alternative hearing on <mark>climate change</mark> for members of Congress and the public, defying the leadership of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. Johnson, ranking member of the committee and a Democrat who represents the 30th district of Texas, decided to hold what she calls a “round table” on global warming because she feels that the committee chair—Lamar Smith (R–Texas)—has not allowed real <mark>climate</mark> experts to speak about their research at the hearings he has run. Instead, she says, Smith gives <mark>climate change</mark> deniers a platform to express their views.</P><P>Johnson says this problem is not confined to global warming, and that under Smith’s leadership the committee does not focus enough on science issues in general. So Johnson plans to host a series of these round tables on issues such as ocean acidification, environmental justice, artificial intelligence and more. <EM>Scientific American </EM>asked Smith’s staff for comments on the alternative hearings and Johnson’s remarks but did not receive a response by the time of publication.</P><P><EM>Scientific American</EM> spoke with Johnson about her plans for the round tables and what she hopes they will accomplish<EM>.</EM></P><P>[<EM>An edited transcript of the interview follows.]</EM></P><P><STRONG>You held a <mark>climate change</mark> round table late last month. What did it entail? </STRONG>
It’s important that the science behind global <mark>climate change</mark> be acknowledged. And clearly, at the rate we’re going with the leadership in the current [House Science] Committee, it’s probably not going to happen. So we wanted to make sure that the scientific information had an opportunity to be discussed.
We had that [round table], and we plan to have several more to discuss a number of topics—but [<mark>climate change</mark>] is certainly an important one. We had two panels: one with experts who could talk about the research as well as the effects of what’s happening with the <mark>climate</mark>. The second panel had to do with the international view, from ambassadors as well as participants in the [2015] Paris [<mark>climate</mark>] conference, to show that this is a world view—deniers might be confined to the United States.</P><P><STRONG>Why not discuss these issues during the standard House Science Committee hearings?</STRONG>
Because the chairman in the majority has control over what is discussed, and we have not been successful in getting [<mark>climate change</mark>] discussed with actual scientific research. Whenever the topic has come to the surface, we get at most fringe witnesses—people who agree to be in denial. The experts who do the research on a daily basis are never allowed to speak during the regular order of business.
In my judgment the country is moving backwards with this type of committee leadership. But we don’t want the public to believe that it’s the entire committee. There are people on the committee who believe strongly in research, the National Science Foundation, the Environmental Protection Agency and in NASA. So we have no choice but to attempt to do some alternative hearings to make sure that people are aware that we do believe in science, and that it should be discussed—we should not deny good research. It’s an opportunity to listen to a view that we never hear on the committee.</P><P><STRONG>What do you currently see happening with science issues in the House Science Committee?</STRONG>
There really is not much focus on the science. It’s focused on the administration or against the agencies, and it’s always an approach of suspicion and denial.</P><P><STRONG>Would you say that applies only to <mark>climate change</mark> or science issues in general?</STRONG>
It’s science issues in general. I’m in my third term of dealing with this particular chairman. And almost exclusively, the goals seem to have been pointed against anything the Obama administration had made any type of goals on—the attitude was to be against it. Now the attitude is to cut the agencies that are doing the research in these areas—as if to say: “We’re not going to even listen to them. We don’t want them to do the research.”</P><P><STRONG>You are planning to do a series of round tables. What issues do you want them to focus on?</STRONG>
We need to look at the public health implications of <mark>climate change</mark>, ocean acidification, environmental justice, biological engineering, forensic science, artificial intelligence—there are a number of issues that we’re not getting the opportunity to have honest hearings on under the leadership of this committee. We cannot afford to sit idly by and let those topics slide as if they don’t have an impact today.</P><P><STRONG>What do you hope these round tables will accomplish?</STRONG>
I don’t know the impact they might have on Congress, because those of us who are interested in getting the scientific evidence at this time appear to be Democrats—although we know there are members on the other side who are not blinded to this information. But they are influenced by their leadership.
But it’s foolhardy for us to just give in and act as if nothing is happening, just because the leadership feels that way. So I feel an obligation to respond to the public. Whether we can get [anything] done will depend on the committee leadership, and this administration’s leadership.
When you look at the cabinet that this president [Donald Trump] has put in place, it does appear that they are in agreement with each other that they’re going be in denial [about <mark>climate change</mark>], and if they don’t like the research, they stop it. Well, that is not how we got to where we are on the world stage, and I don’t think we should step off the stage as if we’re going to stop thinking and living for the future.</P><P><STRONG>Is this the beginning of a larger effort by some members to change attitudes toward science in Congress?</STRONG>
I cannot begin to guess why the attitude persists from this leadership for us to go backwards. But what I can say is, I’m not willing to cooperate with it. We might be hampered temporarily, but we want the public to understand that we do not have our heads in the sand. We’re getting a lot of positive feedback from the general public. People are very concerned about <mark>climate change</mark>, about environmental safety, about the conditions of our water and air. That concern continues to be expressed, and we feel an obligation to be responsive. At the rate we’re going, though, I don’t know how much we can do.</P><P><STRONG>Are you concerned that elected officials are putting less stock in evidence-based thinking? If so, what larger steps could help stop or even reverse this trend?</STRONG>
A leading nation cannot afford to be governed by ignorance for more than a very short period of time. The leadership that we have on this committee is out of step, and people will react to it. The facts are real. The world is aware of [<mark>climate change</mark>]. And we look like a group of ignoramuses, saying, “It’s not happening.” The people of this nation will not tolerate that for very long.
This attitude is so temporary and backwards that it’s worth pushing ahead to the extent that we can—to continue to acknowledge the scientific evidence, and hope that we don’t lose too much ground.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,0.0,

But whether that will lead to a less-congested transportation system—saving fuel and cutting down on greenhouse gas emissions—remains to be seen, according to be transportation experts.</P><P>“The impact can be dramatic, but there remains a lot of uncertainty about it,” said Jeffrey Gonder, a researcher at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado. “There needs to be further research to try to more intelligently understand where are the key tipping points in the evolution of the technology, so we can help encourage the beneficial impacts and mitigate the negative impacts.”</P><P>The plan comes on the heels of President Obama’s call in his State of the Union address to reduce emissions in a “21st-century transportation system.” The sector’s <mark>carbon</mark> footprint is second only to the power sector, contributing around 27 percent of overall emissions in the United States in 2013, according to U.S. EPA.</P><P>Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx announced Thursday the president’s upcoming fiscal 2017 budget proposal would include $3.9 billion over 10 years for automated cars. The money would go to testing self-driving cars and other connected vehicle systems in designated corridors around the country (<A href=""https://www.eenews.net/eenewspm/stories/1060030650"" target=""_blank""><EM>Greenwire</EM></A>, Jan. 14).</P><P>“We are on the cusp of a new era in automotive technology with enormous potential to save lives, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transform mobility for the American people,” Foxx said at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. “Today’s actions and those we will pursue in the coming months will provide the foundation and the path forward for manufacturers, state officials and consumers to use new technologies and achieve their full safety potential.”</P><P>Safety grabbed the spotlight. Foxx also described a series of initiatives aimed at making sure government regulations kept up with the technology. He promised an <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/assets/2016/01/14/document_pm_01.pdf"" target=""_blank"">update</A> to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s 2013 preliminary policy statement on autonomous vehicles within six months that recognizes the progress the technology has made in the past three years.</P><P>But reducing emissions from the transportation sector is an increasingly important theme for Obama as he works to build a legacy of <mark>climate change</mark> action. Last December, the Department of Transportation launched a Smart City competition asking municipalities to submit plans integrating technology <mark>innovation</mark>s to help ease traffic and reduce greenhouse gases.</P><P><STRONG>Lots of theories, not much practice</STRONG>
Transportation experts have long modeled the many hypothetical ways in which connected, intelligent or driverless vehicles might cut back on fuel. Cars that talk to each other can flow right by each other at intersections, avoiding stopping and starting. Smart routing systems can make moving around more efficient, reducing congestion. Vehicles driving directly behind one another because their systems are linked might reduce air drag, a phenomenon called “platooning.”</P><P>When combined with other <mark>innovation</mark>s in transportation, the benefits can be even greater, researchers suggested. Driverless taxis gained more attention when General Motors Co. in early January made a $500 million investment in the ride-sharing company Lyft to develop a network of autonomous, on-demand vehicles.</P><P>“The idea of automated car-sharing vehicle or a ride-sharing service, when you increase the occupancy of a vehicle, the emissions and fuel use overall are going to be split over those individuals, hence they are going to be lower,” said Susan Shaheen, the co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley, whose research focuses on car-sharing.</P><P>Another proposal would combine automation and electric cars. A <EM>Nature <mark>Climate Change</mark></EM> study last year estimated that emissions per mile from light-duty vehicles could fall by as much as 94 percent by 2030 in a “best-case scenario” of electric driverless taxis (<A href=""https://www.eenews.net/<mark>climate</mark>wire/stories/1060021326"" target=""_blank""><EM><mark>Climate</mark>Wire</EM></A>, July 7, 2015).</P><P>“Autonomous vehicles can accelerate or enable the greater use of electric,” said Jeffery Greenblatt, a co-author of the study and an energy researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. “Especially with a car that’s providing rides to others, the vehicle itself can take care of battery recharging, which makes owning an electric car a lot easier. And because these cars would be used five to six times as often as gas-powered vehicles, you pay off the upfront cost more quickly.”</P><P>But an automated transportation might increase fuel use, too, he warned. Driverless technology might get people who don’t usually drive in gas-guzzling vehicles. Trips may get longer if people use automated cars as mobile offices.</P><P>The pilot programs floated by the Department of Transportation funding will be particularly important in figuring out how humans actually react to the technology, said Gonder, from the NREL.</P><P>“Without the technologies out there and people interacting with them, it’s really just speculation and relying on surveys,” Gondor said. “That type of real world experience would really help to get a better understanding to reduce these uncertainties around making predictions for individual behaviors.”</P><P><EM>Reprinted from <mark>Climate</mark>wire with permission from Environment &amp; Energy Publishing, LLC. <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/"" target=""_blank"">www.eenews.net</A>, 202-628-6500</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""article-author-container""><H3 class=""article-author-container__title"">ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)</H3></SECTION></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1.0,1.0,Neutral

It aims to provide what it calls the first-ever &quot;comprehensive assessment of the economic risks our nation faces from the changing <mark>climate</mark>.&quot;</P><P>There will be lost productivity, the report says, because of extreme heat. More power plants will need to be built to provide electricity for air conditioners. Sea-level rise, meanwhile, threatens infrastructure, particularly along the Eastern Seaboard and Gulf Coast.</P><P>&quot;If we stay on our current <mark>climate</mark> path, some homes and commercial properties with 30-year mortgages in places in Virginia, North Carolina, New Jersey, Alabama, Florida, and Louisiana and elsewhere could quite literally be underwater before the note is paid off,&quot; the report says.</P><P>There is a 1-in-20 chance, it says, &quot;that by the end of this century, more than $701 billion worth of existing coastal property will be below mean sea levels, with more than $730 billion of additional property at risk during high tide.&quot;</P><P>The <A href=""https://www.eenews.net/assets/2014/06/24/document_cw_01.pdf"" target=""_blank"">56-page document</A>, which targets a business audience, will be formally unveiled this morning in New York City and posted online at riskybusiness.org. <EM><mark>Climate</mark>Wire</EM> obtained an advanced copy of the report.</P><P>Steyer, Paulson and Bloomberg are scheduled to attend the New York event, in addition to several members of the Risky Business advisory committee: Clinton administration Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Henry Cisneros, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala, as well as Alfred Sommer of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Gregory Page, former CEO and current chairman of the board of <mark>Cargill Inc</mark>.</P><P><STRONG>Short- and long-term impacts</STRONG>
The American economy is already beginning to feel the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, the report says, and &quot;these impacts will likely grow materially over the next 5 to 25 years and affect the future performance of today's business and investment decisions.&quot;</P><P>Rising seas, increased damage from storm surge and more frequent bouts of extreme heat will have &quot;specific, measurable impacts on our nation's current assets and ongoing economic activity,&quot; it says.</P><P>The analysis focuses on three major areas where there are risks as a result of &quot;human-induced <mark>climate change</mark>&quot;: coastal property and infrastructure, agriculture, and energy.</P><P>There are likely to be more extreme storms, it says, such as 2012's Superstorm Sandy.</P><P>&quot;Within the next 15 years, higher sea levels combined with storm surge will likely increase the average annual cost of coastal storms along the Eastern Seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico by $2 billion to $3.5 billion,&quot; the report says. Combined with potential changes in hurricane activity, &quot;the likely increase in average annual losses grows to up to $7.3 billion, bringing the total annual price tag for hurricanes and other coastal storms to $35 billion.&quot;</P><P>Temperature increases over the next five to 25 years are likely to bring about a demand for more power, an amount equal to the generation of roughly 200 average coal or natural gas-fired power plants, the report says. That will cost residential and commercial ratepayers up to $12 billion per year.</P><P>Over the longer term, there will be many more days with uncomfortable and dangerous temperatures, it said. That extreme heat—especially in the Southwest, Southeast and Upper Midwest—threatens &quot;labor productivity, human health, and energy systems,&quot; it says.</P><P>&quot;By the middle of this century, the average American will likely see 27 to 50 days over 95°F each year—two to more than three times the average annual number of 95°F days we've seen over the past 30 years,&quot; the report says. &quot;By the end of this century, this number will likely reach 45 to 96 days over 95°F each year on average.&quot;</P><P>Higher temperatures will bring serious challenges to the farming industry, it says, particularly in certain regions.</P><P>Without adaptation, some Midwestern and Southern counties could see yield declines of more than 10 percent over the next five to 25 years if they continue to sow corn, wheat, soy and cotton, the report says. There is a 1-in-20 chance of yield losses of those crops of more than 20 percent, it says. The analysis does not put a dollar value on those potential losses, because it would be impossible to project future prices, said Matt Lewis, director of communications for Risky Business.</P><P>Risky Business based its findings on data from the National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment and Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC) reports, as well as peer-reviewed literature on extreme weather impacts on crops, labor productivity and energy system performance. It also uses proprietary models on coastal storm surge impact from Risk Management Solutions (RMS), which models catastrophes for the insurance industry and financial institutions.</P><P><STRONG>'Explicitly avoiding' policy prescriptions</STRONG>
The Risky Businesses analysis has been eagerly anticipated by some environmental groups, businesses and Democratic activists because of the high-powered team behind the document. In addition, Steyer has been active politically, using his personal wealth to back candidates he believes support his goals on <mark>climate</mark> and to target others with opposing views.</P><P>The &quot;Risky Business&quot; document, however, does not advocate any actions to address <mark>climate change</mark>. Lewis emphasized that Steyer is just one of 10 people involved, after counting the seven-member Risk Committee.</P><P>&quot;We're not building a list of businesses who are on board for policy. That's not the objective of 'Risky Business,'&quot; Lewis said. &quot;We're explicitly avoiding a discussion of policy in the entire project.&quot;</P><P>Members of the group's Risk Committee don't agree on the best policy to address warming, he said.</P><P>&quot;What they completely agree upon is that <mark>climate change</mark> poses many risks across many sectors of the American economy, and that we should not in good conscience leave those risks unaddressed,&quot; Lewis said.</P><P>The primary goal of the analysis is to help businesses understand those risks, he added. That could help companies make informed decisions.</P><P>&quot;You could change the way capital flows work to real estate, if they start to realize there's properties they're investing in now that could be uninsurable in 20 years,&quot; Lewis said. There could be different investments in the agricultural field &quot;to deal with the changing growth patterns that we expect,&quot; he said.</P><P>Businesses could be involved in shaping government action, Lewis said, but they will have to decide on their own if that's in their best interest.</P><P>&quot;The American business community has a critical role to play both in preparing itself for <mark>climate change</mark> and in informing the policy response,&quot; Lewis said.</P><P><STRONG>Some foresee pushes for regulations</STRONG>
Critics of the Risky Business project, however, said they were concerned it would be used to advocate for expensive fixes.</P><P>The report is likely to &quot;raise alarm bells,&quot; said Chris Neefus, spokesman for Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group linked to energy barons Charles and David Koch.</P><P>&quot;Generally, we find that on the heels of something like this, that folks are looking to raise taxes,&quot; either directly through a <mark>carbon</mark> tax or by rule changes that raise power prices, Neefus said.</P><P>Tom Pyle, president of American Energy Alliance, a nonprofit focused on free-market advocacy and partly funded by energy companies, said that restrictions on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions would be costly and not extremely effective.</P><P>Cutting greenhouse gas <mark>pollution</mark> to zero by 2100 would result in a temperature drop of 0.17 degree Celsius, he said, adding that he was citing information from reports prepared for the IPCC analysis.</P><P>&quot;Squandering the huge amount of resources to do any more than the marketplace is already doing doesn't make a lot of sense to me,&quot; Pyle said.</P><P>Lewis said that one of the key findings of the &quot;Risky Business&quot; report is that increases in temperatures will vary by regions. The average global temperature drop or avoided temperature increase that Pyle is citing is not very useful, Lewis said.</P><P>&quot;While it's easy to sort of point to averages,&quot; Lewis said, &quot;for places like Alaska or like the Southeast that are going to see extreme changes, it doesn't help.&quot;</P><P>Averages mask variability and don't give the true impact, he said. There is the same problem with averages on sea-level rise and flooding, he said.</P><P>&quot;On average, the United States is not going underwater,&quot; Lewis said, &quot;but don't tell that to the people of Miami.&quot;</P><P>One Democratic strategist said he hopes facts in the report will be used for political advocacy with TV ads and other outreach to voters before the election.</P><P>&quot;It potentially can be a piece to the puzzle of turning around the basic framework on this issue,&quot; said Mark Longabaugh, a partner at Democratic media consulting firm Devine Mulvey Longabaugh. &quot;It helps the public accept the idea that <mark>climate change</mark> is going to drastically affect our economy.&quot;</P><P>Oil and coal interests have promoted the idea that cutting <mark>carbon</mark> emissions is costly, he said, while the long-term damage from warming &quot;is far greater.&quot;</P><P>&quot;Once that turns, I think people opposing serious <mark>climate change</mark> legislation are going to be in a really tough spot,&quot; Longabaugh said.</P><P>Lewis, asked about whether Steyer plans any activism on <mark>climate</mark> using the report, referred questions to Steyer's political advocacy arm, NextGen <mark>Climate</mark>. A spokeswoman there did not immediately respond to an inquiry.</P><P><EM>Reprinted from <mark>Climate</mark>wire with permission from Environment &amp; Energy Publishing, LLC. <A href=""https://www.eenews.net"" target=""_blank"">www.eenews.net</A>, 202-628-6500</EM></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class=""article-author-container""><H3 class=""article-author-container__title"">ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)</H3></SECTION></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1.0,1.0,Neutral

Four days have been set aside for the case to be heard at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, beginning today.</P><P>A moratorium on the technique had been in place in Scotland since 2015 and in October last year energy minister Paul Wheelhouse said planning regulations would be used to “effectively ban” it by extending the moratorium “indefinitely”.</P><P>At the time, he said 99 per cent of respondents to a public consultation backed the ban.</P><P>Announcing the legal action in January, Tom Pickering, operations director at <mark>Ineos</mark> Shale, said: “The decision in October was a major blow to Scottish science and its engineering industry, as well as being financially costly to <mark>Ineos</mark>, other businesses and, indeed, the nation as a whole.</P><P>“We have serious concerns about the legitimacy of the ban.”</P><P>The company, which owns two fracking licences in Scotland, said the ban on unconventional oil and gas extraction would result in Scotland missing out on economic benefits, including about 3,100 Scottish jobs and £1 billion for local communities.</P><P>Environmental charity Friends of the Earth Scotland (FoE Scotland) last month submitted a public interest intervention in the case.</P><P>It will argue that the fracking ban is lawful and necessary to meet Scotland’s legally binding <mark>climate change</mark> commitments. The organisation’s lawyers believe it is the first public interest intervention granted in the Court of Session on environmental grounds.</P><P>FoE Scotland’s head of campaigns, Mary Church, said: “We are getting involved in <mark>Ineos</mark>’s judicial review of the fracking ban in order to put forward crucial <mark>climate change</mark> arguments in support of the ban that otherwise would not have been heard.</P><P>“Our intervention argues that the Scottish Government is required to ban fracking so as to urgently cut greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, in line with legally binding <mark>climate</mark> targets.</P><P>“We are confident that the process to ban fracking was robust and fair.”</P></DIV></SECTION></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV><FOOTER role=""footer""><DIV class=""slab slab--wide ""><DIV class=""slab__inner""><DIV class=""footer-social""><DIV class=""footer-social__links""><H3 class=""footer-social__title"" title=""Follow Us On"">Follow Us On</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></FOOTER></BODY></HTML>",2.0,2.0,Strongly Negative

Why ?</I></P><P><I> Well, read the interviews of editor-in-chief Dean Baquet</I><A href=""http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/01/dean-baquet-addresses-nyts-republication-of-antisemitic-200788.html "" target=""_blank""><I>to know why</I></A><I>:</I></P><P><I> 'Here is how I made the call, and it wasn't easy. We have a standard that is pretty simple. We don't run things that are designed to gratuitously offend.'</I></P><P><I> 'Gratuitously offend'? What is offensive about Charlie's last cover? Depicting a bearded muslim, not even designated as Muhammad, with a sign 'I Am Charlie' and a message 'All Is Forgiven'? Drawn by a guy who had been shot at a week before by two Islamic turds and miraculously managed to survive? Offensive TO WHOM?</I></P><P><I> Well, we know. We know that the New York Times has not shied from publishing anti-semitic caricatures when those caricatures were news. And Baquet makes no bones about it:</I></P><P><I> 'Let's not forget the Muslim family in Brooklyn who read us and is offended by any depiction of what he sees as his prophet. I don't give a damn about the head of ISIS but I do care about that family and it is arrogant to ignore them.'</I></P><P><I> And Public Editor Margaret Sullivan adds: 'Ultimately, he decided against it, he said, because he had to consider foremost the sensibilities of Times readers, especially its Muslim readers. To many of them, he said, depictions of the prophet Muhammad are sacrilegious; those that are meant to mock even more so. We have a standard that is long held and that serves us well: that there is a line between gratuitous insult and satire. Most of these are gratuitous insult.'</I></P><P><I> So it's not that Baquet and the NYT are saying that Charlie's latest cover is particularly offensive or disrespectful. No, its only drawback it THAT IT IS. Not even 'a depiction of Muhammad'. No: a depiction of a bearded muslim that might be construed by some muslim reader in Brooklyn to be Muhammad.</I></P><P><I> What's the meaning of this? Some say that the NYT is simply scared, scared of being the target of Muslim fundamentalists if it publishes the Charlie cover. But it's not even that â€“ which would already be bad enough. It's worse.</I></P><P><I> It's that they have made the choice that they'd rather pander to the sensibilities of their muslim readership, in Brooklyn or elsewhere, than bring them the news. They have accepted that if their muslim readership thought a depiction of a bearded muslim who may be construed as Muhammad was offensive to them, then they would not show it to them, or anyone else.</I></P><P><I> And what in turn is the meaning of this?

	</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>If renewable energy is ever to account for a large part of the total energy supply, countries will need to install new, large-scale transmission grids, both to get power to cities from remote areas such as deserts that often have the best renewable resources, and to combine power from widely distributed wind turbines and solar panels, which can help average out fluctuations in their output. In Europe, there’s been talk for years of a supergrid that would pull together power from hydroelectric dams in Scandinavia with wind farms in Germany and large solar farms in Spain and even North Africa (see “<A href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/news/405558/a-supergrid-for-europe/"">A Supergrid for Europe</A>”).</P><P>But such a supergrid has faced serious technical hurdles. The transmission lines that make up conventional power grids use alternating current (AC), which loses large amounts of power over long distances unless complicated and expensive measures are taken. DC is more efficient over long distances, and it offers the additional benefit of working well underground and underwater, reducing or eliminating the need for the unsightly transmission towers that can make it difficult to site new transmission lines.</P><P>DC lines have long been used to transmit power across the North Sea, and from large hydroelectric dams to cities. But until <mark>ABB</mark>’s advance, it wasn’t safe to connect DC lines into a large-scale grid.</P><P><mark>ABB</mark>’s circuit breaker changes that. Within five milliseconds it can stop the flow of a huge amount of power—equal to the entire output of a nuclear power plant, <mark>ABB</mark> says. The breakers could be used to nearly instantaneously reroute power in a DC grid around a problem, allowing the grid to keep functioning. “Ordinarily, if something goes wrong anywhere, all the power goes off,” says Claes Rytoft, <mark>ABB</mark>’s chief technology officer. “The breaker can cut out the faulty line and keep the rest healthy.”</P><P>Researchers have been trying to develop high-voltage DC circuit breakers for a century (see “<A href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/news/427504/edisons-revenge-the-rise-of-dc-power/"">Edison’s Revenge: The Rise of DC Power</A>”). Mechanical switches alone didn’t work—they shut off power too slowly. Power electronics made of transistors that can switch on and off large amounts of power offered a possible solution, but they proved far too inefficient. <mark>ABB</mark>’s solution combines power electronics with a mechanical switch to create a hybrid system that’s both fast and efficient. The new circuit breaker could also be far less expensive than systems that use only transistors.</P><P>“The cost of the power electronics breaker was humongous,” says Ram Adapa, a power delivery technical leader at the Electric Power Research Institute. “The hybrid breaker should be less costly.”</P><P>With the major hurdle to DC grids out of the way, <mark>ABB</mark> is now developing algorithms to control them. The system will still need to work in concert with AC lines for distributing the power in local communities, since there is no inexpensive DC equivalent of the transformers needed to step down power to the relatively low voltages used in homes and businesses. One of the first markets for the new technology could be Germany, which has decided to turn off its nuclear power plants and rely heavily on renewable energy (see “<A href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/428145/the-great-german-energy-experiment/"">The Great German Energy Experiment</A>”).</P><P>The degree to which high-voltage DC grids can help renewables may depend on the economics of installing underground cables versus overhead lines. Obtaining rights-of-way is one of the biggest obstacles to installing new transmission lines in many countries, and underground installations don’t require obtaining new rights-of-way, since they can be easily installed along existing roadways. <mark>ABB</mark> says that when the entire system cost is taken into account, underground installations are only slightly more expensive than overhead ones. But Adapa is skeptical, saying that underground installations could cost five times as much.</P><DIV class=""callout--tagged-event-promo"" desc=""in-story-promo-mittr-subscribe""><P class=""callout__copy"">Cut off?

If that proves correct, VW’s defective vehicles could be responsible for between 237,161 and 948,691 tonnes of NOx emissions each year, 10 to 40 times the <mark>pollution</mark> standard for new models in the US. Western Europe’s biggest power station, Drax in the UK, emits 39,000 tonnes of NOx each year.</P><P>Germany’s Tagesspiegel newspaper said on Tuesday that VW’s board would replace Winterkorn, who has led the company since early 2007, with Matthias Mueller, who runs the company’s Porsche sports car division. Volkswagen rejected Tagesspiegel’s report and Winterkorn continued to ask for the public’s trust on Tuesday, saying the scandal was caused by “the bad mistakes of a few”. But Wednesday’s meeting will prove crucial to how VW responds. </P><P>The company’s shares fell 10% as the German stock market opened on Wednesday although recouped some early losses. A third - some €25bn - of the company’s stock market value had already been lost since Friday when the emissions scandal first emerged.</P><P>New York and other state attorney generals are forming a group to investigate the scandal, New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman said, adding to a series of investigations in the US, <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Europe</A> and Asia that threaten to sap Volkswagen’s resources and impose large penalties.</P><P>In the US, just <A href=""http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1097513_which-states-have-the-most-diesel-vehicles-new-data-gives-results"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">3% of passenger cars are diesel</A> compared with almost half in the EU. Prof Martin Williams of King’s College London said the US’s low percentage of diesel cars meant higher diesel emissions in some cars would have a “limited effect” on air quality there.</P><P>“[In the US it would be] nowhere near the effect it would have in this country and in the rest of Europe for that matter,” he said. In the UK, Williams added, emissions from diesel cars cause roughly 5,800 premature deaths each year. “If you were to make the cars emit at the legal limit you could reduce those deaths by at least a factor of two and maybe more. Maybe a factor of five.”</P><P>The <A href=""http://cleanair.london/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Clean Air in London campaign</A> called for a royal commission to investigate carmakers’ activities in the UK. “Diesel is without doubt the biggest public health catastrophe in UK history.

But the Grangemouth plant will receive 27,500 cubic metres of ethane extracted from beneath western Pennsylvania in the US, where shale gas production has boomed.</P><P>The imports are due to replace dwindling supplies from the UK’s North Sea reserves.</P><P>The gas has travelled more than 3,500 miles via a “virtual pipeline” of eight tankers to reach Grangemouth, where <mark>Ineos</mark> has built an import terminal as part of an overhaul costing £450m. The ethane will be fed into “crackers” that convert the gas into ethylene, used in the production of a range of plastic products.</P><P>“Shale gas can help stop the decline of British manufacturing and today is a first step in that direction,” said Ratcliffe.</P><P>But consignments such as this one, due to arrive on a giant tanker named the <mark>Ineos</mark> Insight, will be the only source of shale gas for Grangemouth if the Labour party wins a general election.</P><P>Speaking at Labour’s annual party conference the shadow energy minister, Barry Gardiner, said the party would ban fracking and focus on low <mark>carbon</mark> energy sources if it wins the next general election. “Fracking locks us into an energy infrastructure that is based on fossil fuels long after our country needs to have moved to clean energy,” said Gardiner. “So today I am announcing that a future Labour government [would] ban fracking.”</P><P>Jeremy Corbyn, Labour’s leader, has previously said that fracking is “not compatible” with tackling <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Although <mark>Ineos</mark> has begun importing from the US, where an abundance of shale gas has left the world’s largest economy with more than it needs, it would like to become the leading player if fracking takes off in the UK.</P><P><mark>Ineos</mark>, which slashed its tax bill by moving its headquarters to Switzerland in 2010, was awarded 21 new licences in December, including sites in North Yorkshire, the north-west and east Midlands.</P><P>The awards increased the area of land over which it holds licences to 1m acres, nearly twice the area of the Yorkshire Dales national park.</P><P>But <mark>Ineos</mark>’s ambitions have been curtailed by slow progress in obtaining planning permission, which is necessary before it can exploit the licences.</P><P>A spokesperson for <mark>Ineos</mark> said earlier this year that it hoped to have 30 planning applications lodged before the end of the year but the company has since scaled back its plans to five, followed by a further 25 over the next 12 months.</P><ASIDE class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded"" data-component=""rich-link"" data-link-name=""rich-link-2 | 2""><DIV class=""rich-link""><DIV class=""rich-link__container""><DIV class=""rich-link__header""><H1 class=""rich-link__title"">UK advertising watchdog admits it was wrong to ban Greenpeace fracking advert</H1></DIV><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more""><DIV class=""rich-link__read-more-text"">

Average new car emissions in Europe were 135.7g in 2011, almost meeting the 2015 target four years early, which environmental campaigners have cited as evidence the targets were not set low enough. On Wednesday, the EU is expected to propose a target of 95g by 2020.</P><P>Greg Archer, of campaign group Transport and Environment said: &quot;It is time for the hypocrisy to stop. <mark>BMW</mark> should stop talking up how green and efficient their cars are whilst at the same time lobbying to weaken planned regulations to improve the fuel efficiency of cars.

It's clear that a lower CO<SUB>2</SUB> target is better for British motorists' pockets. The target needs to be achievable but we think 95g is.&quot;</P><P>The car industry is split on the new EU proposals, with smaller car makers such as Fiat, Renault and Peugeot lining up with &quot;progressive&quot; makers such as Ford and Toyota against the German car makers, Volkswagen, <mark>BMW</mark> and Daimler. Paul Everitt, the chief executive of the UK motoring trade body, the SMMT, told the Guardian the 95g target was &quot;fairly comfortable&quot; – albeit &quot;technically challenging&quot; – for manufacturers.</P><P>The German car companies are understood to favour a &quot;phase-in approach&quot;, where the cut-off date for their new fleets to meet the 95g target is pushed back to 2022, with only a percentage of their fleets required to meet it in 2020 and 2021. A similar phased-in approach was used for the 2015 target – 75% of a manufacturer's fleet must meet the 2015 target by 2013.</P><P>A new version of the leaked proposals shows that additional allowances have been given to heavier and larger vehicles since the first proposals were leaked in early June.</P><P><mark>BMW</mark> declined to comment.</P><P>Sara Ayech, <mark>climate</mark> campaigner at Greenpeace, said: &quot;The new car efficiency targets being discussed by the EU this week must not let the big polluters off the hook.

</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ASIDE><P> Dudley had run BP’s Russian joint venture for years and knew better than anyone the risks and rewards in the booming hydro<mark>carbon</mark> superpower. On 14 January, the BP boss agreed a bold share swap deal with Putin’s state-controlled <mark>Rosneft</mark>.</P><P>It was a deal that stunned the business world, revealing BP’s determination to reinvent itself with a new centre of gravity to the east. It was again perceived as a global force on the world stage, and its shares hit their highest level since the disaster.</P><P> Environmentalists, though, were infuriated. Once at the vanguard of efforts to migrate to a low-<mark>carbon</mark> world “Beyond Petroleum”, BP was now hitching its wagon to Putin’s controversial state-controlled oil giant, a business racing to dominate fossil fuel riches beneath Arctic — and dismissive of western <mark>climate change</mark> warnings.</P><P>Whatever <mark>climate change</mark> rhetoric might have been aired before or since, this was serious. In BP’s hour of need, like so often before, the British government sprung forward with its official blessing.</P><P> “You cannot move to a low <mark>carbon</mark> economy overnight,” said the then energy minister Chris Huhne after the hastily arranged signing ceremony on that damp, dark Friday evening at BP’s head office in London’s St James’s Square. “This is a very key British player which happens to be a fundamental part of almost everybody’s pension fund.”</P><P>“BP, as we all know, is coming out of a difficult period in its history. This partnership shows BP is very much open for business.” </P><P>Yet it was only three years since Dudley had fallen out spectacularly with the Russian establishment, fleeing Moscow in the face of what he claimed was “sustained harassment” and going into semi-hiding.</P><P>Leaked US diplomatic cables revealed how Dudley had been whispering to American officials, accusing Igor Sechin, Putin ally and <mark>Rosneft</mark> boss, of supporting a “black PR” campaign against him. Another US cable recorded many observers “believe [Sechin] was behind … attacks on TNK-BP”. TNK-BP was the BP joint venture Dudley had run.</P><P>The eventual BP-<mark>Rosneft</mark> tie-up was to be cast on slightly altered terms than initially planned — BP sold its Russian joint venture and took cash and a 19.75% stake in <mark>Rosneft</mark>. But this was the UK giant pointing to its future.</P><P> When Vladimir Putin was asked why he had chosen to link up with a company so recently tainted by the Gulf of Mexico disaster, he reached for a suitably muscular Russian proverb: “One man who’s been beaten is worth two who haven’t.” In Washington, there was outrage. “BP once stood for British Petroleum. With this deal, it now stands for Bolshoi Petroleum,” spluttered Ed Markey, senior Democrat on the House of Representatives’ natural resources committee.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1.0,1.0,Negative

</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></HEADER><DIV class=""content__article-body from-content-api js-article__body"" itemprop=""articleBody"" data-test-id=""article-review-body""><P>This past year had so many stories involving human-caused <mark>climate change</mark> – it will be forever in our memories. Here is a summary of some of the high points, from my perspective. When I say “high points” I don’t necessarily mean good. Some of these high points are bad and some are downright ugly. Let’s do the good first.</P><H2><STRONG>The Good</STRONG></H2><P>The best news of all, in my opinion, is the continued cost reductions and huge installations of clean energy both in the US and around the word. Wind, solar, and other <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/<mark>climate</mark>-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/03/doe-charts-show-why-<mark>climate</mark>-doom-and-gloom-isnt-needed"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">renewables have been on an incredible run of decreasing costs</A> and creative financing, which has made them economically competitive with dirty fossil fuels. Improvements and expansion of grid-based power storage has also advanced. These storage abilities are needed to allow intermittent power sources (like wind and solar) to play an even larger role in delivering power to the grid. In the end, clean power will win out based on simple dollars and cents – regardless of the fact they will also help save the world. </P><P>On an international scale, the US, China, and other countries <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/<mark>climate</mark>-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/dec/14/the-paris-agreement-signals-that-deniers-have-lost-the-<mark>climate</mark>-wars"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">ratified the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement</A>, which gives us a reasonable chance at avoiding the worst effects of <mark>climate change</mark>. In the lead up to that ratification, the US took major actions domestically to reduce its own emissions through steps like <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/03/obamas-clean-power-plan-hailed-as-strongest-ever-<mark>climate</mark>-action-by-a-us-president"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">the Clean Power Plan</A>. </P><P>Emissions have been reduced in some countries like the US for a variety of reasons. First, very cheap natural gas is displacing dirtier coal-based power. Secondly, renewable energy sources like wind and solar are expanding, and people are using energy more wisely. All of this happened with a major reduction in energy costs in the US. This shows you can have clean energy that is also cheap.</P><P><A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/<mark>climate</mark>-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/may/02/peabody-coals-contrarian-scientist-witnesses-lose-their-court-case"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">In court, it was a good year</A>. A rag-tag group of pro-bono <mark>climate</mark> scientists beat a bunch of <A href=""https://www.desmogblog.com/2016/06/07/peabodys-outlier-gang-couldnt-shoot-straight"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">high-paid contrarians in court</A>. We showed that their science was nonsense and the smart judge gave a very harsh judgement to the funded deniers.</P><P>And last in this part of the list, I think this is the year we can say the <mark>climate</mark> deniers and the contrarians who downplay global warming threats finally lost the science war. In the past, there were a dwindling few scientists each year that attempted to find evidence that the world was not warming, or wasn’t warming much. </P><P>Each year, the number of scientists in this group got smaller and smaller. This year, they were virtually nonexistent. The contrarians have almost given up looking for contrarian evidence – it just isn’t there. They have ceded the scientific field because their research was found to be wrong. Now, these contrarian scientists only appear in blogs, op-eds in newspapers, sometimes in pay-for-play journals – but rarely in competitively reviewed scientific venues. After being wrong for decades, they have seemingly just given up.</P><H2><STRONG>The Bad</STRONG></H2><P>Despite the progress above, global warming continued. In fact, <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/<mark>climate</mark>-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/21/global-warming-continues-2016-will-be-the-hottest-year-ever-recorded"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">2016 marked the third year in a row that record global temperatures were set</A>. We are well over halfway to the 2-degree mark that puts us into a real <mark>climate</mark> danger zone and we have not even come close to doubling <mark>CO2</mark> yet (although we will).</P><P>The temperature levels reached this year don’t prove the world is warming; in fact, we never look at a single year as evidence. Rather, <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/<mark>climate</mark>-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jul/27/<mark>climate</mark>-models-are-accurately-predicting-ocean-and-global-warming"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">proof was found in the oceans</A>. Several major studies were published this year that clearly show the world’s oceans are warming and that computer simulations have been spot-on in their predictions. Simply put, the Earth is warming and the models got it right.</P><P>But that said, reaching almost 1.5 degrees Celsius with only about a 45% increase in the amount of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere means that the contrarians, like <A href=""http://www.drroyspencer.com/2016/06/another-potential-reason-why-<mark>climate</mark>-sensitivity-is-over-estimated/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Roy Spencer</A>, <A href=""http://www.reporting<mark>climate</mark>science.com/2016/05/08/schmidt/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">John Christy</A>, <A href=""https://skepticalscience.com/lindzen-illusion-4-<mark>climate</mark>-sensitivity.html"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Richard Lindzen</A>, <A href=""https://www.skepticalscience.com/William_Happer_blog.htm"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">William Happer</A>, and <A href=""https://judithcurry.com/2016/04/25/updated-<mark>climate</mark>-sensitivity-estimates/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Judith Curry</A>, are shown conclusively to be wrong. The rate of warming we are seeing, in both the air and ocean temperatures, is inconsistent with the fanciful and optimistic beliefs of this group. </P><P>But not only does the Earth not care about the contrarians; the weather doesn’t either. And it has been a crazy year with many <mark>climate</mark>-change induced weather events that should give us all cause for concern. We know that a warming <mark>climate</mark> will have many weather effects. For instance, in a warming world, there is increased evaporation which tends to dry out areas and make droughts worse. But, in some parts of the world, the warming air has more water vapor (higher humidity) so that heavy rainfalls occur and<A href=""http://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/abs/10.1680/feng.14.00015"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline""> more flooding</A> happens. The general rule of thumb is that areas which are currently dry will become more dry. Areas that are currently wet become wetter. And rains will occur in heavier downpours. And that is just what we are seeing.</P><P>In the United States, we have had a continuation of the <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/<mark>climate</mark>-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/sep/17/global-warmings-one-two-punch-extreme-heat-and-drought"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">terrible drought in California</A>. We’ve had a new heat-wave drought in the southeastern part of the US and that led to <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/<mark>climate</mark>-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/dec/02/fires-and-drought-cook-tennessee-a-state-represented-by-<mark>climate</mark>-deniers"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">terrible wildfires</A>.</P><P>There have been terrible floods in other locations, including Maryland, West Virginia, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, Iowa, among others. Outside the US, there has been an incredible heat wave in the Arctic which has led to the lowest ever <A href=""https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">wintertime ice ever recorded there</A>. The Arctic is looking very precarious for the important summertime low ice extent. We have a good chance at breaking the record (again). </P><P>Terrible flooding the UK, Myanmar, Argentina, Indonesia, Spain, and Egypt, and others. There have been simultaneous flooding and heat waves in Australia, crazy hot weather in India and the Middle East.</P><P>And typhoons and hurricanes are <A href=""https://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/top-ten-tropical-cyclone-events-of-2016-potentially-influenced-by-clim"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">getting stronger because of <mark>climate change</mark></A>. As we warm the planet and its oceans, there is more energy available to fuel these hurricanes. According to expert Jeff Masters, 2016 saw the strongest storms ever observed in two regions. We also witnessed seven Category 5 storms, which is a huge number. Among typhoons that hit land, two of the top five occurred this year. These listed weather events, which are increasing, have been predicted to be an outcome of global warming. The scientists making these predictions got it right. </P><H2><STRONG>The Ugly</STRONG></H2><P>One of the two events in this category should come as no surprise – the election of Donald Trump. While I continue to hold out hope that Trump will take <mark>climate change</mark> seriously, he is <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/<mark>climate</mark>-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/nov/17/trump-begins-filling-environmental-posts-with-clowns"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">surrounding himself with people who are not scientists</A> – rather, they are advocates for the fossil fuel industry. Many have histories of not only denying the science but working to undermine the science and the scientists who study <mark>climate change</mark>. There is very little evidence that Trump or his administration will take <mark>climate change</mark> seriously. </P><P>However, there are rumors <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/<mark>climate</mark>-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/dec/12/on-<mark>climate</mark>-change-angels-and-demons-are-battling-over-trumps-soul"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Trump’s daughter may be more understanding of science</A>. There is also the possibility that Trump will realize he is in a powerful position, a Republican President with a Republican Congress. If he realizes the economic and social peril that <mark>climate change</mark> poses, he may take it upon himself to be a savior of sort for the world. If, on the other-hand, he kills <mark>climate</mark> funding, pulls us out of our international agreements, and goes backwards on our own emission reductions, we will see a devastating effect for our <mark>climate</mark> and a probable rise in energy prices. It would be so ironic if, for instance, energy prices are higher in four years than they are now.</P><P>The second ugly event is the continuation of the ubiquitous misinformation on <mark>climate change</mark>. With the reduction of responsible and professional staff and organizations, news has been abdicated to second-rate non-reporters. Some examples are David Rose from the UK who writes for The Mail on Sunday. In November he wrote <A href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3974846/Stunning-new-data-indicates-El-Nino-drove-record-highs-global-temperatures-suggesting-rise-not-man-emissions.html"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">an article</A> wherein he claimed that the recent record temperatures were a result of El Niño, not global warming. <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/<mark>climate</mark>-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/dec/05/fake-news-tries-to-blame-human-caused-global-warming-on-el-nino"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">His fake news article was embarrassingly wrong</A>. </P><P>You might have thought Mr. Rose was a <mark>climate</mark> scientist by reading his article, but he ignored 7 out of 8 <mark>climate</mark> records, he focused on a portion of the atmosphere and threw out out most of the warming data, he cherry picked his data set, ignored records set without El Niño, and he omitted the entirety of the Earth’s oceans in order to get his result – and he was still wrong. But, when articles appear in newspapers, even ones like The Mail, they have a veneer of credibility. Simply put, the reason 2014, then 2015, and now 2016 are all-time records is that we have emitted heat trapping gases. Rose is full of baloney.</P><P>But misinformation wasn’t limited to the UK, it had its normal huge presence in the US. In the Wall Street Journal, contrarian Roger Pielke Jr. <A href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/my-unhappy-life-as-a-<mark>climate</mark>-heretic-1480723518"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">published an article</A> where he described himself as a <mark>climate</mark> heretic. His name might be familiar as <A href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/<mark>climate</mark>-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/mar/25/fivethirtyeight-misrepresents-<mark>climate</mark>-change-research"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">a former writer for Nate Silver’s 538 blog</A> before they rapidly parted ways. Pielke claims that he was attacked by “thought police in journal, activities groups funded by billionaires, and the White House”. </P><P>What Pielke didn’t tell his readers is that he threatened colleagues who dared to confront his faulty science (<A href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/7/28/1317347/-<mark>Climate</mark>-disinformer-Roger-Pielke-Jr-out-at-Nate-Silver-s-FiveThirtyEight-blog"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">For which Nate Silver apologized). </A> He also wrote misleading pieces that <A href=""http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/disasters-cost-more-than-ever-but-not-because-of-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">discussed tsunamis, volcanoes and earthquakes as though they were weather events</A> (or at the very least, he failed to distinguish the difference to his readers). They are not weather events. Roger Pielke Jr’s problems were of his own making by poor science and shoddy professionalism. There are many other examples including those of second rate scientists or non-scientists finding high-profile media venues to spin their fantasies. It has become harder for readers to discern the real from the fake, the low from the high quality, the good from the fodder. And this issue brings me to the end, and my hope for 2017. </P><H2><STRONG>Hope for 2017</STRONG></H2><P>After this year of fake news in US politics and elsewhere, I am hopeful that consumers of news will become much more discerning. I am hopeful that people who were duped this year will have higher standards next year. I hope that the thirst for reputable news and responsible sources will revitalize news media in the US. </P><P>In particular, I hope that we see a resurgence in real reporters. People who have a professional obligation to get things right. People who live and die by their reputations and therefore cultivate those reputations. I understand that the Washington Post is actually hiring news reporters. This is unheard of in US print media but I hope it is a harbinger of things to come.</P><P>If news consumers ask “where is this information coming from?” “Is it reputable?” “Can I double-check this article?” “What conflicts of influence might be present with this reporter of news?” Then, 2017 will be a glorious year and set us on a path of recovery.</P><P>I am also hopeful that the economic position of renewable energy continues to improve. If so, the president of the USA won’t matter. We will be on a path to a cleaner safer world just based on unstoppable economics.</P><P>Here’s to 2017!</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,0.0,

In the case of Cargill, its undeclared <mark>climate</mark> emissions of 130m tonnes are comparable to the combined national emissions of Denmark, Bulgaria and Sweden.</P><P>“They shouldn’t be able to indulge themselves in the fiction that they are not culpable for these indirect <mark>climate</mark> impacts,” says Alex Scrivener, policy officer at Global Justice Now and co-author of the analysis, who adds that Yara, Tyson and Cargill are just the “tip of the iceberg” when it comes to evaluating the <mark>climate</mark> emissions produced by agri-food companies.</P><P>Campaigners have been particularly critical of Yara and Tyson for their membership of a two different <mark>climate</mark>-smart agriculture initiatives – the <A href=""http://www.fao.org/gacsa/members/en/"" rel=""nofollow"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Global Alliance on <mark>Climate</mark> Smart Agriculture</A> and <A href=""http://www.wbcsd.org/agri-business-leaders-get-<mark>climate</mark>-smart-at-cop21.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">World Business Council for <mark>Sustainable</mark> Development</A>.

Yara says it is helping to reduce emissions through sharing knowledge on more efficient farming techniques and supporting research to reduce emissions from fertiliser application.</P><P>“Obviously companies aren’t as responsible for indirect emissions as they are for direct emissions. But I think most people would recognise that, at the very least, companies need to be aware of the impact of their supply chain and end use of their products, and make this information public,” says Scrivener.</P><P>While the focus of the findings were on global agri-food businesses, Tara Garnett, coordinator of the food <mark>climate</mark> research network at Oxford University, says the responsibility for <mark>climate</mark> emissions lies across the food chain with consumers who eat the food and supermarkets who sell it, as well as manufacturers like Cargill and Tyson who produce it. </P><DIV class=""submeta""><SPAN class=""submeta__label"">Topics</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,2.0,Strongly Negative

The news is a major victory that the iPhone maker has been working toward for years through the <A href=""https://9to5mac.com/2017/06/13/renewable-energy-1-billion-green-bond/"">purchase of green energy bonds and other renewable investments</A> in its supply chain and physical infrastructure. The company’s last milestone, <A href=""https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/21/11277498/apple-renewable-energy-environment-iphone"">announced two years ago</A>, was 93 percent of its worldwide operations running on clean energy. </P><P id=""aZItyo"">The announcement comes just one week after Google announced that it now <A href=""https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/4/17197342/google-renewable-energy-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">purchases enough renewable energy to offset its global energy consumption</A>. Similarly, Apple’s global operations, including some suppliers in China and facilities in places without access to clean energy, are not technically 100 percent renewable, meaning not every single joule or electron used is initially created by wind, solar, or other green energy plants and farms. </P><DIV class=""c-float-right""><ASIDE id=""huq4aZ""><Q>Apple is not technically powered by 100 percent renewable energy</Q></ASIDE></DIV><P id=""Zq5siL"">For instance, Apple Stores that are powered by municipal power grids cannot reliably use clean energy because once electricity enters the grid, you can no longer determine its source or cleanliness. As a way to account for that, Apple purchases what are known as <A href=""https://www.vox.com/2015/11/9/9696820/renewable-energy-certificates"">Renewable Energy Certificates</A>, or RECs, which are a tradable commodity that guarantee the cleanliness of an energy source. (Think of it like the opposite of a <mark>carbon</mark> tax.) Apple also invests in wind, solar, and other clean energy facilities around the globe, builds its own energy sources, and ensures that any new offices and plants it constructs do actually run on 100 percent clean energy, like the <A href=""https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16295514/apple-park-campus-photos-iphone-event-2017"">newly opened Apple Park campus</A>. The company says it also puts excess green energy into the grid, so it can be used by others. </P><P id=""KZgAnF"">Apple says its approach differs from others in the tech industry in some key ways. For one, the company says it always seeks to fund and build its own energy projects, and does so for around two thirds of all of its energy needs globally. “Where it’s not feasible to build our own generation, we sign long-term renewable energy purchase contracts, supporting new, local projects that meet our robust renewable energy sourcing principles,” reads the company’s <A href=""https://images.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Responsibility_Report_2017.pdf"">58-page Environmental Responsibility Report</A> published last year. “In cases where we aren’t able to create new renewable energy projects ourselves due to local constraints, we directly purchase renewable energy from newer projects in nearby markets, or through available utility green energy programs. Apple says that when it purchases REQs, “we require that they are Green-e Energy certified and come from the same power grid—and preferably the same state — as the Apple facility they support.”</P><P id=""Mz3uSy"">Apple is working toward making sure that every single retail store, office, data center, and manufacturing facility worldwide, in all 43 countries it operates in, run on 100 percent clean energy. That’s not possible today, given the dependency on electric grids, regional utility monopolies, and energy hurdles in manufacturing hubs like China, among other factors.

Dozens of states now require that a portion of their electricity come from renewable sources. In October, California became the first to require its utilities to install energy-storage equipment — expected to boost technologies such as batteries that can be used when the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow. China has increased its use of solar power to reduce the smog blanketing its major cities.</P><P class=""p-text"">&quot;The good news: We already know how to do a lot,&quot; says Jane Long, who's leading the California Council on Science and Technology's study on how the state can meet its pledge to slash emissions 80% from 1990 levels by 2050. Even so, she says breakthrough technologies, requiring a public and private partnership, will be needed to make fuels with nearly zero emissions.</P><P class=""p-text"">There's not a lot of time to make changes, says <mark>climate</mark> scientist David Archer of the University of Chicago. He says research suggests dire changes could occur if the Earth warms 2 degrees Celsius (or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) this century.</P><P class=""p-text"">&quot;We're halfway there,&quot; Archer says, adding the planet could reach that mark as soon as 2040 if <mark>carbon</mark> emissions continue their current climb. &quot;This is just the fire alarm.

But he says it also offers another lesson: &quot;Never discount the power of human ingenuity.&quot;</P><P class=""p-text"">Here are six technologies — some old, some new — that might stem the worrisome warming trend:</P><P class=""p-text"">1.<B>Solar geo-engineering </B> is sort of the Hail-Mary pass when attempts to cut <mark>carbon</mark> emissions don't go far enough. It includes blasting sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight away from Earth or spraying fine sea salt into the sky to whiten clouds.</P><P class=""p-text"">&quot;They all act very fast. They're all cheap enough that money is not the issue and they're all inherently imperfect,&quot; says Keith, author of the 2013 book <I>A Case for <mark>Climate</mark> Engineering. </I>&quot;The thing we most need to do is talk about it,&quot; he says, adding more research is needed on the effects and efficacy.</P><P class=""p-text"">&quot;One powerful country could do it by itself,&quot; if desperate enough for a quick but temporary fix,&quot; says <mark>climate</mark> scientist Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution for Science. He notes how Mount Pinatubo's 1991 eruption in the Philippines, which fired sulfur particles high into the air, cooled global temperatures nearly one degree Fahrenheit in 1992 and 1993.</P><P class=""p-text""><B>2. <mark>Carbon</mark> capture, </B>which traps emissions from power plants and removes them the atmosphere<B>, </B>might obviate the need for such a drastic step.</P><P class=""p-text"">Because of its current high cost,  no commercial, coal-fired facility has yet to employ this technique. In May, the first effort is slated to debut in Kemper County, Miss; it's designed to capture 65% of <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. Earlier this year, MIT developed a simpler scrubbing system that it says can be added relatively easy to existing facilities.</P><P class=""p-text"">The U.S. Department of Energy is funding research on how to capture industrial emissions and either store them underground or use them to make products such as fuel, plastics, cement and fertilizer. Without federal funds, Mark Herrema founded Newlight Technologies, a California-based company that captures methane emissions from dairy farms and uses them to make plastic.</P><P class=""p-text"">Klaus Lackner, a Columbia University geophysicist, is working on synthetic trees that absorb <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide about a thousand times faster than natural trees. Keith's Calgary-based start-up, <mark>Carbon</mark> Engineering, funded partly by Bill Gates, is developing industrial-scale technologies to capture <mark>carbon</mark> from the atmosphere and use it to produce low-<mark>carbon</mark> transportation fuels.</P><P class=""p-text"">3. <B>Artificial photosynthesis </B>could yield an entirely new, emissions-free energy source. In 2011, Nocera unveiled his &quot;artificial leaf&quot; — a credit-card-sized silicon solar wafer that, when placed in a glass of tap water and exposed to sunlight, generates hydrogen and oxygen bubbles that can be stored and — when needed — recombined in a fuel cell to generate electricity.</P><P class=""p-text"">&quot;We already know how to do this,&quot; Nocera says. The problem: His water-splitting device generates hydrogen fuel, but there's no network yet of hydrogen filling stations in the United States. So his start-up, Sun Catalytix, launched to develop the device, is now focusing instead on grid-scale flow batteries.</P><P class=""p-text"">DOE is funding related research at the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, led by the California Institute of Technology. &quot;The goal is to produce a chemical liquid fuel&quot; that can replace gasoline, says spokesman William Royea, adding it will likely take a decade or so to reduce costs enough to make it commercially viable.</P><P class=""p-text"">4.<B> Solar and wind power</B> have surged in recent years, and research is finding new applications. MIT and Sandia National Laboratories have developed ultralight, atom-thin solar cells that can be embedded in flexible products like drapes or harder structures like a tablet's outer shell to produce power. Similarly, they're developing transparent cells that can be placed on windows.</P><P class=""p-text"">Companies such as California-based Makani, acquired this year by Google, are trying to harness power from high-altitude wind, which is faster and steadier. Their challenge: tethering airborne turbines hundreds of feet off the ground without interfering with aircraft. MIT researchers are looking at far-offshore wind turbines and, to store their power and anchor them, huge concrete spheres that sit on the seafloor.</P><P class=""p-text"">&quot;Storage will be the game changer&quot; for solar and wind, because their power is intermittent but electric grids need consistency, says Bob Armstrong,director of the MIT Energy Initiative. So universities, start-ups and major companies are working to boost battery performance. Some advances debuted this year, including a battery by General Electric that's paired with a Texas wind farm to provide continuous power.</P><P class=""p-text"">5. <B>Nuclear power</B>, disliked by many environmentalists because of safety and waste disposal concerns, is welcomed by <mark>climate</mark> scientists including James Hansen as a major energy source that doesn't emit <mark>carbon</mark>.</P><P class=""p-text"">DOE has offered $8.3 billion in loan guarantees to help build a nuclear power plant in Georgia and is funding efforts by  two companies — North Carolina-based Babcock &amp; Wilcox and Oregon-based NuScale Power — to develop small modular reactors. These school bus-size versions of current light water reactors could be made in U.S. factories and moved from site to site. DOE says it expects commercial operation around 2025.</P><P class=""p-text"">TerraPower, a start-up in Bellevue, Wash., that's partly funded by Bill Gates, is developing a larger, 500-megawatt, &quot;traveling wave&quot; reactor that runs on nuclear waste and can go 40 years without refueling. Last year, Gates said the company is looking to build a demonstration plant and &quot;China is one possible place.&quot; This month, DOE posted a proposed agreement between an unnamed U.S. company and the Chinese government to develop such a reactor.</P><P class=""p-text"">6. <B>Efficiency </B>is often seen as the invisible energy source, because it's energy not used. Though basic technology, its potential is huge. Long, who's studying California's efforts, estimates efficiency upgrades could halve the state's energy demand by 2050. Building practices such as superior insulation and air sealing have proven to slash a home's energy use up to 90%.</P><P class=""p-text"">&quot;This is the best way to get at <mark>climate</mark> mitigation,&quot; says David Gottfried, co-founder of the U.S. Green Building Council, a private non-profit group. Noting that residential and commercial buildings account for nearly 40% of total U.S. energy use, he says ultra-efficient buildings can essentially become &quot;our power plants of the future.&quot;</P><P class=""p-text p-text-last"" id=""article-body-p-last"">IBM is working with cities, utilities and the federal government to boost efficiency by using sensors, meters and digital controls to monitor and automate how energy is used. The Obama administration is requiring new cars and light trucks to nearly double their fuel efficiency by 2025.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,1.0,Positive

In 2015, USGBC participated in two events hosted by <mark>BASF</mark>’s Creator Space™ to examine paths to resilience in urban, coastal neighborhoods. Findings from those discussions were recently published in the whitepaper “<A href=""https://creator-space.<mark>basf</mark>.com/content/<mark>basf</mark>/creatorspace/en/celebrating-150/white_papers/new-york-whitepaper.html"" target=""_blank"">Co-creating solutions for urban neighborhoods in coastal cities</A>.&quot;</EM></P><P>Coastal cities are on the front lines of <mark>climate change</mark> impacts. Cities such as New York are increasingly being affected by devastating storms and events that threaten natural resources, infrastructure and communities. A greater understanding of where and how communities are vulnerable to loss from coastal hazards is leading to the adoption of planning and development practices that help dictate the ability to bounce back and limit the amount of loss after damaging storms and events.  </P><P>In an effort to address some of these issues, <mark>BASF</mark> held a Creator Space<SPAN> New York City</SPAN> tour in May 2015. The aim was create strategies to improve urban living in coastal areas, using the Red Hook area of Brooklyn, N.Y. to serve as a model for other communities recovering from disasters. A diverse collection of industry experts, including members of USGBC, local residents and academics converged during two key Creator Space events, the Summit on Urban Living and the Creator Space Design Competition.</P><P>The events focused on three broad areas: habitat, citizenship and resilience, all aimed at improving the quality of life in Red Hook.</P><P>Ideas generated from the summit are captured in the white paper<SPAN>,</SPAN> which contains actionable recommendations for both rebuilding the community and increasing the resilience of infrastructure and buildings in the event of rising sea levels. Three ideas, featured below, represent ways to further resiliency and sustainability for coastal cities around the globe. Although these ideas could work in isolation, their impact is exponential when deployed holistically.</P><P><STRONG>Establish a network of green corridors:</STRONG> In addition to enhancing circulation and absorbing or channeling runoff from rainstorms to increase flood resilience, re-landscaping required to create green corridors would also improve social cohesion and reduce Red Hook’s isolation through shared spaces for pedestrians, as well as allowing for increased community interaction.</P><P><STRONG>Create a coastal park</STRONG>: To work in harmony with an ever-changing environment, a coastal park would serve not only as a first line of defense from storm surges and rising sea levels, but would also double as protection and recreational space for Red Hook’s residents. A second line of protection farther from the shoreline, consisting of breakwaters, dikes and ponds, would help absorb storm surges.</P><P><STRONG>Inspire with a model block:</STRONG> The concept behind the model block could demonstrate how smart design, the latest technology from <mark>BASF</mark>, can affordably preserve the character of a neighborhood and contribute to its resiliency and sustainability. Additionally, it serves to demonstrate a framework for <mark>sustainable</mark> and efficient living and working in an urban environment.</P><P> </P><P>Since the summit, <mark>BASF</mark> is continuing the dialogue among multiple stakeholders to share the solutions developed from the summit in an effort to help other coastal communities benefit from the research and findings. We are also exploring opportunities with private development partners, government advocates and NGOs with local interests that recognize the value of investing in a more resilient Red Hook. We see community engagement as paramount to the success of this effort and are establishing strong relationships with local residents, neighborhood businesses and key stakeholders to address consequences of <mark>climate change</mark> on the environment.</P><P>We are feeling the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> across the globe. As the frequency and intensity of natural disasters become increasingly common, building greater resilience in coastal communities in a timely and responsible manner is of the utmost importance and requires investment, <mark>innovation</mark> and action. Extreme weather events, like Superstorm Sandy, remind us that development cannot occur without addressing <mark>climate change</mark> and sea level rise.</P></SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2.0,2.0,Strongly Positive

                        The historical Paris Agreement was adopted in December 2015 by as many as 196 States, parties to the UNFCCC. It aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of <mark>climate change</mark> by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C. In October 2016, after a very swift process, the accord cleared the final threshold of 55 countries representing 55 percent of global emissions required for it to enter into force. Both developed and developing countries shall commit to ambitious emissions reductions, while the UNFCCC defines the rules of implementation and establishes a viable plan to provide financial support to developing countries to support <mark>climate</mark> action. International scientific, technological and financial co-operation is viewed as an element of crucial importance. How are global corporations, institutional players and first-tier research institutions reacting to the new, global challenges in the energy sector? At this event, global stakeholders will present their visions and strategies, which will then be challenged by ETH faculty members and researchers.

          This article is part of the <SPAN class=""related-item"">World Economic Forum Annual Meeting</SPAN></A></DIV><DIV class=""article-body""><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>For anyone concerned about disruptive <mark>climate change</mark>, 2016 was a tumultuous year. On 4 November, the <A href=""https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/09/what-is-the-paris-agreement-on-<mark>climate</mark>-change/"">Paris <mark>climate change</mark> agreement</A> went into force; three days later, Donald Trump, who has called <mark>climate change</mark> a <A href=""https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en"">hoax</A> “created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive” was elected President of the United States.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>Even before election day, there were troubling signs on the horizon. Scientifically, new data showed that two of the most dangerous impacts of <mark>climate change</mark>, <A href=""https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/09/greenland-s-ice-sheets-are-disappearing-faster-than-predicted-here-s-why-you-should-care"">ice-melt</A> and record <A href=""https://www2.ucar.edu/atmosnews/news/1036/record-high-temperatures-far-outpace-record-lows-across-us"">high temperatures</A>, were accelerating. Politically, conservatives in Washington, DC were already mobilizing to <A href=""https://cei.org/content/paris-<mark>climate</mark>-agreement-treaty-requiring-senate-review?gclid=CjwKEAiA17LDBRDElqOGq8vR7m8SJAA1AC0__jNJOAcaaE761vv8pA9xc-iBRGMvh9k2RBF607KA4xoCNGzw_wcB"">block</A> the Paris accord, just as they blocked US participation in the Kyoto protocol. </P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>Now the President-elect proposes to appoint the CEO of Exxon-Mobil, Rex Tillerson, whose company has <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/31/business/global/exxon-and-rosneft-partner-in-russian-oil-deal.html"">committed to developing</A> the world’s largest untapped oil reserves - in the Russian Arctic - to lead the US State Department.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>Scientists have <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>brief.org/analysis-only-five-years-left-before-one-point-five-c-budget-is-blown"">little doubt</A> that development and combustion of these reserves will push global atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations above the level of dangerous <mark>climate</mark> disruption. As one recent scientific <A href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v517/n7533/abs/nature14016.html"">paper</A> puts it: “development of resources in the Arctic … [is] incommensurate with efforts to limit average global warming to 2°C.” </P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>But the fact is, a number of oil and gas companies have been gearing up to drill in the Arctic for many years and the Paris Agreement doesn’t change that. In fact, it left each country to decide for itself what to do and how to do it. So while American leadership would be desirable, it is not a prerequisite for the rest of us to proceed.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>There is an enormous amount that the business community can do, because at root the solution to <mark>climate change</mark> is technological. Anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> is primarily caused by burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests. Therefore, it will be prevented primarily by switching the sources of our energy and greening our supply chains. Government policies can support and accelerate these transitions, but they are not required.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>According to <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-14/solar-and-wind-just-did-the-unthinkable"">Bloomberg</A>, solar power is now the <A href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2017/1/1/1615247/-Solar-now-cheapest-new-form-of-energy-in-nearly-60-countries"">cheapest</A> form of energy in many countries, including in nearly 60 low-income ones. In emerging markets, solar and wind are outcompeting oil, gas and coal, despite very low <A href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-14/solar-and-wind-just-did-the-unthinkable"">prices</A> for those commodities. Some of this is driven by government policy, particularly investment by the Chinese government in renewable energy infrastructure, but increasingly renewable energy is both preferable and profitable. </P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>Meanwhile, at Unilever, <A href=""https://www.unilever.com/news/speeches/Paul-Polman-interview-with-Business-Green.html"">CEO Paul Polman</A> is demonstrating that businesses can support <mark>sustainable</mark> development while serving both their customers and their shareholders. Unilever has aligned their corporate strategy with the United Nations Millennium Development goals, noting that the scale of the activities of large corporations enables them to have real impact.</P></DIV><H2 class=""st__content-block st__content-block--heading""><B>Overcoming obstacles </B></H2><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>However, private-sector leadership on <mark>climate</mark> will require us to overcome some conceptual obstacles. </P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>One conceptual obstacle is that “socially responsible” is not fiscally responsible. In diverse sectors, companies around the globe have proved that isn't true. Just look at <mark>BMW</mark>. According to a recent <A href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/kathryndill/2016/01/22/the-worlds-most-<mark>sustainable</mark>-companies-2016/#4a7f3ef4965f"">report</A> in Forbes, <mark>BMW</mark> was the world’s most <mark>sustainable</mark> company in 2016, while enjoying low employee turnover, taking a responsible approach to investment, maintaining a low ratio of CEO-to-average worker pay, and, yes, making large profits by making great cars.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>That said, many socially responsible policies don't address <mark>carbon</mark> - indeed, <mark>BMW</mark> lags badly on that point. Addressing <mark>climate</mark> in terms of both products and policies - including the application of corporate prestige and influence to advance sound <mark>climate policy</mark> - should be an essential part of any programme of social responsibility. </P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>A second is the free-rider problem. For a long time, many argued that it would be ineffective, perhaps even foolish, to act alone on <mark>climate</mark>: <mark>climate change</mark> was a global problem that needed a global solution. Going forward, Russia or the US could become drains on the world economy if they continue to promote damaging fossil fuel development, and already some political <A href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/19/us/politics/trump-<mark>climate</mark>-change.html?_r=0"">leaders</A> have <A href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/donald-trump-us-<mark>carbon</mark>-tax-nicolas-sarkozy-global-warming-paris-<mark>climate</mark>-deal-a7418301.html"">suggested</A> that a <mark>carbon</mark> tax might have to be imposed on US imports. But the fact is: as renewable energy technology becomes increasingly profitable, the companies and countries that lead its development will see their influence and power increase. </P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>A third is the idea that efficiency and design are for sissies. Most near-term population growth is likely to be in urban areas, which offers tremendous opportunities not just for energy efficiency but also for creative solutions that support a high quality of life, both at home and in the workplace. The <A href=""http://www.bullittcenter.org/"">Bullitt Center</A> in Seattle is a case in point: it doesn’t just use less energy, it <I>produces</I> energy. </P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>The fourth is the hobgloblin of “energy poverty”. Of course poor people need energy, but that does not mean they need fossil fuels. To the contrary: the work of Social Entrepreneur <A href=""http://www.schwabfound.org/content/harish-hande"">Harish Hande</A>, Global Shaper <A href=""https://www.globalshapers.org/shapers/jaideep-bansal"">Jaideep Bansal</A>, and others like them demonstrates that renewable power can meet the needs of poor communities quickly and efficiently.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>Just as many rural communities leapfrogged land-lines to adopt mobile telephones, so these communities are <A>leapfrogging</A> 20th Century style land-line electricity into 21st Century distributed solutions. Large, smart integrated grids may be a good choice for the US and Europe, but highly distributed energy may well solve energy poverty, particularly when coupled to the rapid advances in <A href=""https://electrek.co/2016/07/27/tesla-powerwall-6-months-customer-review/"">local</A> energy storage that are underway. After all, why make poor people wait for a big expensive grid run on fossil fuels when they can have the energy they need right now?

The floodwaters have since receded, but the images of upheaval remain etched in our collective memory. Recovery will take years, perhaps decades, and it will cost billions of dollars.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>Experts tell us that warming oceans are causing hurricanes to become <A href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/09/05/global-warming-make-powerful-hurricanes-more-likely-scientists-say/Q3lUW6iKuGEKvpTOD22sGL/story.html"">more powerful</A>, and other consequences of anthropogenic <mark>climate change</mark> – from <A href=""http://www.fao.org/emergencies/crisis/drought-hoa/en/"">severe droughts</A> in the Horn of Africa to <A href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/india-floods-bangladesh-nepal-deaths-millions-homeless-latest-news-updates-a7919006.html"">extreme flooding</A> in Asia – are leaving millions without food and basic shelter. But while the link between burning fossil fuels and deadly weather has been <A href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9s9-7.html"">strengthening for years</A>, policymakers have not always heeded the warnings.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>This is changing rapidly. Today, countries, citizens, and a growing number of businesses around the world are finally taking action. This month, thousands gathered for the UN’s <A href=""http://unfccc.int/meetings/bonn_nov_2017/meeting/10084.php""><mark>climate change</mark> conference</A> in Bonn, Germany, to ratchet up global ambition in the fight against <mark>climate change</mark>. Following the successful <A href=""http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php"">Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement</A> two years ago, expectations for further progress and continued collaboration are high.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>One of the more promising recent initiatives is the <A href=""http://www.<mark>carbon</mark>pricingleadership.org/""><mark>Carbon</mark> Pricing Leadership Coalition</A> (CPLC), which brings together 30 governments and more than 180 businesses and strategic partners to put a value on <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions. The idea is simple: if we are to meet the Paris accord’s target of limiting the increase in global average temperature to less than 2° Celsius above preindustrial levels – ideally, to 1.5° above preindustrial levels – we must dramatically cut emissions. As <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>pricingleadership.org/governance/"">co-chairs of the CPLC</A>, we believe that one of the best ways to do that is by shifting the social and economic costs of heat-trapping gases from the public to the polluter.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>With the sense of <mark>climate</mark> urgency increasing, it is no longer acceptable to pollute for free and pass the bill to future generations. Putting a price on <mark>carbon</mark> is the most efficient way to reduce global emissions while encouraging <mark>sustainable</mark> and robust economic growth. Moreover, by putting a price on <mark>pollution</mark>, governments can generate revenue for investments like clean energy, schools, and health care, making it a double win.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>The ultimate goal, of course, is to encourage businesses to clean up their acts, and today, a growing share of business leaders understand that pricing <mark>carbon</mark> is one of the best ways to combat <mark>climate change</mark>. They also recognize that their businesses can thrive even as they work to reduce emissions.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>In fact, many business leaders are among the most enthusiastic supporters of effective <mark>carbon</mark> pricing. Just last month, the <mark>Carbon</mark> Disclosure Project <A href=""https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/002/738/original/Putting-a-price-on-<mark>carbon</mark>-CDP-Report-2017.pdf?1507739326"">revealed</A> that the number of companies with plans to pursue internal <mark>carbon</mark> price mechanisms has grown to almost 1,400 globally, up from 150 in 2014. This includes more than 100 of the world’s largest companies, with total annual revenues of some $7 trillion. Royal DSM (which is led by one of the authors) has set a <A href=""http://annualreport.dsm.com/ar2016/en_US/5-letter-from-the-ceo.html""><mark>carbon</mark> price of €50 ($59) per ton</A>, joining other global companies like Michelin, Danone, and General Motors in applying meaningful <mark>carbon</mark> prices to “<A href=""http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2016/06/01/dutch-company-royal-dsm-prices-<mark>carbon</mark>-to-future-proof-its-business"">future-proof</A>” their business.</P></DIV><DIV class=""st__content-block st__content-block--text""><P>Some 40 countries – including Canada – are also putting a price on <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark>, and more governments are planning to implement similar schemes soon. In 2015, China announced plans to create the world’s largest <mark>carbon</mark>-pricing system. And earlier this year, Ontario, Québec, and California <A href=""https://www.<mark>carbon</mark>pricingleadership.org/news/2017/9/12/ontario-california-quebec?rq=quebec"">signed an agreement</A> to create the world’s second-largest <mark>carbon</mark> market.</P></DIV><FIGURE class=""st__content-block st__content-block--image""><DIV class=""image__credit"">

To reduce greenhouse-gas emissions further and foster economic vitality, we must improve public transportation; construct energy-efficient buildings; and support efforts by businesses, innovators, and investors to develop clean-energy solutions.

By pricing <mark>carbon</mark> <mark>pollution</mark> and harnessing our collective abilities, we can address the former and seize the latter.

To create a more resilient and food-secure future, organizers recommend several policy priorities to narrow these gaps:</P><UL><LI><STRONG>The Knowledge Gap:</STRONG> Public- and private-sector leaders should build on successful early warning systems to develop a real-time global food security dashboard that allows decision-makers to detect and address disruptions to the global food system before they occur.</LI><LI><STRONG>The Productivity Gap:</STRONG> Public, private and multilateral actors must invest to increase agricultural productivity in low-income countries in a <mark>sustainable</mark> manner, while minimizing its impact on the environment.</LI><LI><STRONG>The Collaboration Gap:</STRONG> Global leaders need to create specialized forums to enable better decision-making in times of crisis, introduce long-term measures, and engage cross-sector decision-makers on global food security issues.</LI></UL><P>“This exercise shed light on areas in which collaboration can catalyze cooperation to help head off food shortages before they occur,” said exercise mentor Senator Tom Daschle, CAP Chairman and Founder and CEO of The Daschle Group. “<mark>Climate change</mark> will certainly stress our global food system, but we are now better armed with a deeper understanding of how decision-makers may act as shortages escalate into crises.”</P><P>“In the beginning stages of the simulation, leaders were apprehensive to act and collaborate. But, as inaction led to increased volatility and instability, they worked together to find solutions,” said <A href=""../../experts/dave-mclaughlin"">David McLaughlin, senior vice president for <mark>sustainable</mark> food at WWF</A>. “They found that no one nation, organization or business could successfully address global food security, yet the actions of any one entity could create negative impacts globally.”</P><P>“Food Chain Reaction demonstrated that the global food system can withstand the pressures of <mark>climate</mark> and political instability,” said Joe Stone, vice president for animal nutrition at Cargill. “But a new approach focused on breaking down barriers and public-private action is required.”</P><P>“Governments, civil society and businesses are grappling with how to work together to provide safe, affordable and nutritious food for a growing population threatened by <mark>climate change</mark>,” said Dave Crean, vice president for corporate research and development at Mars, Incorporated. “Food Chain Reaction gives us all clear evidence that collaboration and innovative public-private partnerships are essential to building a more secure food system for the future.”</P><P>A full set of findings, recommendations and participants are available at <A href=""http://foodchainreaction.org/"">www.foodchainreaction.org</A>.</P><P># # #</P><P><STRONG>About Food Chain Reaction</STRONG></P><P><A href=""http://foodchainreaction.org/"">Food Chain Reaction</A> was held in Washington, D.C.

Despite occupying only 1.3% of the world’s surface, Indonesia represents about 10% of the world’s remaining tropical forests, and is home to 12% of world’s mammals, 7.3% of reptiles and amphibians, and 17% of birds. However, Indonesia is rapidly losing its biodiversity due to various factors.</P><P>Over the last century, Sumatra has seen drastic losses of its forest areas, especially in the low-lying eastern part of the island which are exposed to greater risk. The altering of forest landscapes for palm oil, natural rubber and pulp and paper  etc. has been a primary driver of this loss. If the current rate of deforestation continues, Sumatra may lose all of its forests in the near future.</P><P>Forests in Borneo (Kalimantan), which was also covered with tropical rainforests and a very important habitat for endangered mammals such as orangutans, elephants and rhinos, have declined by 50% over the last fifty years.</P><P>The partnership engages in a variety of forest conservation activities in different parts of Indonesia including the Tesso Nilo and Bukit Barisan Selatan National Parks in central and south of Sumatra respectively, and Borneo. </P></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id=""lafp-view-4th""><DIV class=""lafp-2block lafp-box-900""><DIV class=""lafp-2block-right lafp-float-right lafp-2block-4image""><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><B>©</B>naturepl.com / Lynn M.
