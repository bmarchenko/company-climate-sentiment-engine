Out of these applications electrical motors are having the highest share of electrical energy use, about 53 per cent. By 2030 the number of transformers and motors needed is expected to grow considerably. Most of the older motors and transformer products in use today and many of the new ones being sold waste electricity. This leaves less money for citizens, businesses, and governments to spend on other priorities. It also worsens air <mark>pollution</mark> and strains electricity grids. As a Partner in United for Efficiency, <mark>ABB</mark> is helping developing and emerging countries adopt energy efficiency policies to transform their markets to high performance motors and transformers.</P><P>The energy savings potential is enormous. For example, the best transformers can reduce energy losses by up to 60 per cent. Optimised motor systems can yield energy improvements of 20 to 30 per cent.</P><P><mark>ABB</mark>, a global market and technology leader in motors and transformers, is a longstanding Partner of United for Efficiency. Recently, <mark>ABB</mark> <A href=""http://www.<mark>abb</mark>.com/cawp/seitp202/4357e5f25b4d8bccc12580eb00358f41.aspx"">renewed</A> its commitment for another three years.</P><P>“<mark>ABB</mark> is happy and proud to be involved as a Partner in this initiative,” says Kai Pollari, Manager, Energy Efficiency, Global Marketing Unit at <mark>ABB</mark>’s transformer business.</P><P>“The strength of the United for Efficiency is that it brings together the views, experience and knowledge of the different parties and stakeholders from different sectors. It is inspiring to see that actors with different mission and background we have worked with in this programme share the same basic views on energy efficiency – the benefits it can provide to people, companies and nations; and that it makes sense and is necessary.”</P><P>Energy efficiency is an essential element of <mark>ABB</mark> corporate strategy.</P><P>“Global <mark>climate change</mark> and the obligations of the Paris Agreement are calling for immediate actions. We see United for Efficiency as a practical vehicle for addressing these questions,” says Olli Mansikka, Business Intelligence Manager at <mark>ABB</mark>´s motor &amp; generator business.</P><P>United for Efficiency has over 30 <A href=""http://united4efficiency.org/partners/"">Partners</A>. They contribute to the overall objective of reducing 2030 worldwide electricity demand by more than 10 per cent in a variety of ways: offering technology expertise, supplying market intelligence to help inform decision making, lending resources for training sessions and events, offsetting the costs of activities, conducting communications, and much more.</P><P>Over the coming years, <mark>ABB</mark> will be involved with training policymakers and technical experts around the world as they look to implement electricity policy and equipment market transformation in their countries. <mark>ABB</mark> will also promote the multiple benefits of energy-efficient products through a global campaign.</P><P>Together, United for Efficiency’s Partners are helping people around the world enjoy a higher quality of life with modern products that are kinder to the planet and to their finances compared to the outdated technologies of the past.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>","1","1","Positive"
