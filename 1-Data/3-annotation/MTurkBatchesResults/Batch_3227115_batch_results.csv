It therefore includes the Arctic 30 – the 28 activists and two freelance journalists who were arrested following a protest at a <mark>Gazprom</mark>-operated Arctic oil platform in the Pechora Sea on September 18.</P><DIV id=""attachment_81140"" style=""width: 384px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><P class=""wp-caption-text""><STRONG>Greenpeace activist, left, puts his hands up as Russian Coast Guard officers, center masked, disrupt the action. Another Greenpeacer hangs from a rope thrown upon the <mark>Gazprom</mark> drilling rig, September 18, 2013. (Photo courtesy Greenpeace).</STRONG></P></DIV><P>Several of the Greenpeace activists attempted to scale the oil platform to dramatize their contention that oil extraction in Arctic waters risks  spills that would be impossible to clean up, and burning the fossil fuel would accelerate <mark>climate change</mark>. Originally also charged with piracy, that charge against the Arctic 30 was dropped by Russian prosecutors.</P><P>A ruling in November by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ordered Russia to allow the Arctic 30 to leave the country immediately and to release the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise, as soon as a bond of 3.6 million euros in the form of a bank guarantee was paid. That bond was posted by the Government of the Netherlands – where the Arctic Sunrise is registered – on November 29. The ship is still in Russian hands and Russia is now in defiance of that order.</P><P>While the Arctic 30 were in prison, first in Murmansk and later in St. Petersburg, <mark>Gazprom</mark> was not idle.</P><P>Today the Russian oil giant announced it has produced the first commercial quantities of oil from its Arctic drilling platform Prirazlomnaya in the remote waters of the Pechora Sea.</P><P>Oil production at Prirazlomnaya is the first commercial oil extraction from the Arctic shelf anywhere in the world.</P><P>The Prirazlomnaya platform was the focus of the Greenpeace protest in September which led to the arrest and imprisonment of the Arctic 30.</P><P>In response, Greenpeace said that the “clock is ticking” on a major environmental accident in the Arctic region.</P><P>One of the Arctic 30, Faiza Oulahsen of the Netherlands, said, “This is a dark day for the Arctic. <mark>Gazprom</mark> is the first company on Earth to pump oil from beneath icy Arctic waters and yet its safety record on land is appalling. It is impossible to trust them to drill safely in one of the most fragile and beautiful regions on Earth.”</P><P>“This is why I have spent the last two months of my life in jail, but I am just one of millions who oppose this reckless oil rush,” said Oulahsen. “We must stop this trickle of Arctic oil before it becomes a flood.”</P><DIV id=""attachment_47946"" style=""width: 360px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text""><mark>Gazprom</mark>’s Prirazlomnaya platform (Photo courtesy <mark>Gazprom</mark>)</P></DIV><P>“The timing of this announcement is intriguing, to say the least. When <mark>Gazprom</mark> called the authorities and instructed them to arrest us, they never bargained for the global outrage they sparked. Now we are going home and <mark>Gazprom</mark> is licking its wounds,” said Oulahsen.</P><P>“Announcing they have started producing oil does not dissuade us, it makes us more determined than ever to grow this global movement to save the Arctic. We’ve already discovered more oil than we’ll ever need if we’re going to avoid dangerous <mark>climate change</mark>. Looking for more of the stuff in the beautiful fragile Arctic is an act of extreme folly,” she said.</P><P>The offshore Arctic is characterized by freezing temperatures, thick ice, months of constant twilight, giant storms and hurricane-force winds that pose technical risks to any oil company. Greenpeace warns, “There is no proven way of cleaning oil spilled in ice and even a small accident would have devastating consequences on the Arctic’s fragile and little-understood environment.”</P><P>To realize its goal of opening up more of the Arctic to oil exploration, which Russia aims to turn into its “resource base of the 21st century,” <mark>Gazprom</mark> has signed an exploration deal with Shell that will provide it with new capital and much-needed expertise in offshore drilling, even though Shell’s own 2012 attempts to drill in the Alaskan Arctic were marked by a series of repeated accidents and embarrassing safety blunders.</P><P>Yet this deal represents a huge financial and reputational risk for Shell and its investors.</P><P>A recent report written by Greenpeace, Share Action and Platform examined at the risks posed by Shell’s deal with <mark>Gazprom</mark>. It concluded that the partnership may expose Shell and its investors to risks associated with the Russian firm’s poor record on safety, environment and transparency.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>","2","2","Negative"

Moreover, the EU says, <mark>Gazprom</mark> abused its dominant market position to try to keep control of the Yamal transit pipeline across Poland, and to bully Bulgaria into supporting South Stream, a now-cancelled Kremlin project to bring gas across the Black Sea into the EU.</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> had put out feelers to Brussels in previous months to see if it could reach a settlement. But those talks broke down amid the freeze in East-West relations over Ukraine. Now <mark>Gazprom</mark> has 12 weeks to deal with the charges—by rebuttal, concessions or both. If it fails to satisfy the commission, the next stage is enforcement. This could mean fines of €1 billion ($1.1 billion) or more—in theory up to 10% of its turnover—and legally mandated changes to its business model. Such options are still in reserve. “All roads are open,” says Ms Vestager. “We would like <mark>Gazprom</mark> to answer and we would like to talk.”</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark>’s initial response was icy. It said the EU’s complaint was “unfounded”, insisted that it already abides by international law and the domestic legislation of the countries where it does business, and argued that the dispute should be settled at a governmental level. <mark>Gazprom</mark> was established “beyond the jurisdiction of the EU”, it noted. Revealingly, it said that Russian law gave it “special, socially significant functions…and the status of a strategic government-controlled business entity”. Back in 2012 President Vladimir Putin banned such “strategic” companies from disclosing information to foreign regulators or obeying their orders.</P><P>The EU began its move against <mark>Gazprom</mark> with the launch of the “Third Energy Package” in 2007. That was a deceptively bland title for a series of measures that “unbundled”—in fact, upended—Europe’s energy market. The main effect was to ban the same company from owning both the gas pipelines and the molecules that flow through them. Russia objected harshly to this, seeing it as a politicised, unprovoked and confiscatory attack on <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s assets and business model.</P><P>However, rather like Microsoft, which fell foul of EU competition law for bundling its Internet Explorer browser with its Windows operating system, the company and its political masters did not grasp the EU’s ferocious prosecutorial powers. And the more the EU looked at Russian gas imports, the less it liked what it saw. In 2011, in the biggest antitrust raid in the EU’s history, officials with search warrants seized documents and computers from dozens of offices belonging to <mark>Gazprom</mark> and its affiliates. In 2012 the EU followed this up by opening a formal investigation.</P><P>The statement of objections has been largely ready since 2013, but was subject to a long and timorous delay. Ms Vestager’s predecessor, Joaquín Almunia, repeatedly promised to launch charges, but left office in November with that pledge unfulfilled. Senior people in the commission thought a deal would be better than worsening relations with Russia.</P><P>Now Europe is in a more robust frame of mind. Ms Vestager, a steely Dane, insists that her directorate is part of the justice system and acts without fear or favour. The move against <mark>Gazprom</mark> came only a week after it launched a statement of objections against another corporate giant, Google.</P><P>For <mark>Gazprom</mark> the most petulant option would be to ignore the EU. That brings speedy penalties—and also potential lawsuits from customers who have been overcharged, notes Alan Riley, a British law professor. Another option is to mount legal challenges—including ones claiming abuse of property rights. Vaclav Bartuska, the Czech Republic’s energy envoy, forecasts a climbdown, masked by a showy but empty deal on future exports to China to show the Russian public that the Kremlin is punishing Europe for its impudence.</P><P>Russia may also press ahead with <A href=""http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21647939-hungary-and-greece-are-joining-turkey-new-route-russian-gas-twist-pipeline"" target=""_blank"">Turk Stream</A>, a Black Sea pipeline which would deliver gas just as far as the Turkey-Greece border, to avoid the EU rules that stymied South Stream. The Kremlin is wooing Greece to support the project, with a $5 billion sweetener. More such divide-and-rule tactics in Europe are likely: Russia’s pipelines export political influence even when they are still mere lines on a map.</P><P>But turning off the gas taps, to punish the EU, seems unlikely. Russia is losing market share in Europe already, and cannot afford to annoy its customers or endanger its $40 billion export revenues.</P><P class=""xhead"">A cold <mark>climate</mark></P><P>Worries about dependence on Russian gas have in any case diminished. Not only is the winter over but Europe is generally in better shape to withstand a Russian tantrum. It has improved storage, and built north-south gas links, so that a cut in shipments across, say, Ukraine, can be made up with other supplies. Lithuania, once wholly dependent on Russian gas, has built a terminal to import liquefied natural gas (LNG), gaining a swift price cut from <mark>Gazprom</mark>. This year America will start LNG exports, creating yet more supply options.</P><P>For Mr Putin, the commission’s move underlines the scale of Russia’s isolation.

American company ExxonMobil lost its status as the world's largest energy
company, which it retained for 12 years. On the first place in the list was the
Russian concern &quot;<mark>Gazprom</mark>&quot;, the second - the German energy company
E.ON.</SPAN></P><P class=""MsoNormal""><SPAN lang=""EN-US"">According
to the new annual rating of Platts, the largest energy company in the world was
the Russian <mark>Gazprom</mark>, and Exxon Mobil, which previously headed the rating,
dropped to the 9th position.</SPAN></P><P class=""MsoNormal""><SPAN lang=""EN-US"">&quot;In
the conditions that we had in the past year, companies like ExxonMobil and
Chevron, which are prone to commodity price risks, have fallen predictably in
the ranking compared to those companies that have government guarantees of
profit,&quot; an economist from the University told Platts Houston Edward Hears.</SPAN></P><P class=""MsoNormal""><SPAN lang=""EN-US"">According
to Platts analysts, the volatility of prices for hydro<mark>carbon</mark> raw materials,
geopolitical shifts and consolidation of industry forced investors to look for
companies with a high return on their invested capital, which operate under
long-term fixed tariffs, the stability of state regulation and unhindered
access to regional markets.</SPAN></P><P class=""MsoNormal""><SPAN lang=""EN-US"">In spite of
the fact that integrated oil and gas companies continue to occupy high
positions in the list of the largest energy companies, they have been replaced
by electric power companies and network operators. The second in the ranking
was the German company E.ON, whose business is now focused on renewable energy
sources and electric power infrastructure. Thanks to the new development
strategy, E.ON company quickly rose to the top rating from 114th position,
which it occupied a year earlier.</SPAN></P><P class=""MsoNormal""><SPAN lang=""EN-US"">Changes in
the Platts rating reflect fundamental shifts in the energy sector that became
irreversible after the adoption of the Paris Agreement on <mark>Climate Change</mark>
Prevention, when a number of states and large corporations within the framework
of the RE100 initiative assumed voluntary commitments to switch to 100%
renewable energy sources to stop using Fossil fuels and rapidly reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.</SPAN></P><P class=""MsoNormal""><SPAN lang=""EN-US"">The Platts
news agency is part of the US publishing group McGraw-Hill and specializes in
publications on the energy sector and industry information on price quotations
for oil, oil products, natural gas, petrochemical products and industrial
metals in various regions of the world.</SPAN></P><P class=""MsoNormal""><SPAN lang=""EN-US"">Annually
Platts makes a rating of 250 largest power companies in the world. All
companies on the list have assets of at least 5.5 billion US dollars.
Participants of the rating are assessed on profit, asset value, revenue and
financial returns from capital investments.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>

It is likely to be a litmus test of the state of European integration, the EU’s credibility and the nature of EU-Russia relations.</P><H2>The antitrust charge</H2><P><mark>Gazprom</mark>, the Russian state-owned gas extractor and exporter, is accused of hindering competition on the gas market by imposing territorial restrictions in its supply contracts with eight member states (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Slovakia). These are both export bans and destination clauses requiring that gas be used in particular places. </P><P>The European Commission argues that these measures prevent the free flow of gas within the EU, and indeed in the past it has successfully challenged similar restrictions on EU markets. <mark>Gazprom</mark> is also charged with unfair pricing in Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. This pricing is possible partly through using certain formulas that link gas prices to oil products (a practice known as oil indexation), which unduly favour <mark>Gazprom</mark>. </P><P>In Bulgaria and Poland, <mark>Gazprom</mark> may also be leveraging its dominance by making gas supplies conditional on receiving unrelated concessions concerning gas transport infrastructure (demanding investments in <mark>Gazprom</mark>-promoted projects).</P><FIGURE class=""align-center ""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption"">The European Commission’s charges against <mark>Gazprom</mark>.</SPAN><SPAN class=""attribution""><A class=""source"" href=""http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-4829_en.htm"">European Commission</A></SPAN></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H2>Politics at play</H2><P>The geopolitical context within which this antitrust case comes is undeniably significant. Russia has <A href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187936651100011X"">made its gas exports a foreign policy tool</A>. It was able to divide and rule through its pricing policy (charging lower prices in the west and much inflated prices in the east) and supply cut-offs. </P><P>Russia has used its energy exports to put political and economic pressure on importing states, especially in the east, on multiple occasions. As one <A href=""http://www.foi.se/en/Search/Abstract/?rNo=FOI-R--1934--SE"">report from the Swedish Defence Research Agency</A> observed:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Russia has still not let go of the idea that the former Soviet territory belongs to Moscow. Russia clearly perceives these states as its sphere of influence where other rules or ethical norms apply than what is customary in [Western] Europe and in relation to [Western] Europe.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><H2>Litmus test for EU membership</H2><P>The investigation into <mark>Gazprom</mark> follows a formal Lithuanian complaint, one of the allegedly harmed member states. When joining the EU the new member states opened their markets to products from western Europe and agreed to pool sovereignty together in exchange for, among others benefits, the protection of EU law. </P><P>During the accession process some undertook various additional commitments, which led to their increased dependence on Russian gas imports. Lithuania, for example, <A href=""http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP-Lithuania_shuts_Ignalina_plant-0401104.html"">closed its Ignalina nuclear plant</A> and Bulgaria <A href=""http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Countries-A-F/Bulgaria/"">closed its nuclear reactors in Kozloduy</A>. </P><P>If the European Commission were to disregard this case and allow <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s practices to continue without their proper investigation, the faith in the European project would be seriously questioned in the eyes of new member states and their citizens. After all, what good is the EU if it protects only some (that is, those in the old member states)? This issue is only more relevant in light of the developments in Ukraine.</P><P>Similarly, the commission is the guardian of EU treaties. Were it to ignore such an important complaint formally brought by a government of one of the new member states, it would undermine its credibility there. By addressing any identified violations, the EC has an opportunity not only to restore competition, but also to make the EU a more united and stronger player. This potential is reflected in the Lithuanian president’s comment on <A href=""https://twitter.com/Grybauskaite_LT/status/590818345227804672"">Twitter</A>, regarding the matter:</P><H2>Acting with integrity</H2><P>There is also an external political dimension to this case. A permissive approach towards <mark>Gazprom</mark> is likely to question the European Commission’s integrity in the eyes of important partners like the US. In the past the EC did not refrain from blocking large mergers between US firms such as <A href=""http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-01-939_en.htm"">General Electric and Honeywell</A> in 2001, or imposing huge fines on US firms for violations of EU competition law, including <A href=""http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-196_en.htm"">Microsoft</A> and <A href=""http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-09-745_en.htm"">Intel</A>. A lax approach towards <mark>Gazprom</mark> would put the commission’s hard-earned political capital at risk, especially in the trans-Atlantic context.</P><P>The commission should therefore approach the <mark>Gazprom</mark> case in a business-as-usual manner, transparently and diligently adhering to its past practice. It should not stop short of addressing any identified violations, even if it were to encounter legal challenges or was faced with external pressure. It is a matter of faith in the EU rule-of-law, and the commission’s credibility. </P><P>At the same time, like in all competition cases, the commission should be open to the prospect of a settlement – a procedure which it uses effectively – in its enforcement efforts if this is of benefit to all.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>","0","2","Strongly Negative"

                    [post_content] =&gt; With European gas import demand having risen substantially since 2014, <mark>Gazprom</mark> has dramatically increased its sales on the European market. In Q1 2018, <mark>Gazprom</mark> reported record daily gas exports to Europe in late February and early March. This Comment addresses the question of how those volumes were delivered to the market, and the extent to which the infrastructure for delivery of those volumes was used,  highlighting that, in times of peak European gas import demand, full utilisation of the Nord Stream and Yamal-Europe pipelines left Ukraine as the only transit route with spare capacity. Until Nord Stream 2 and Turkish Stream are built, <mark>Gazprom</mark> will remain dependent on gas transit via Ukraine throughout the year, with Ukraine providing substantial flows in summer as European gas storage facilities are refilled, and a combination of significant flows and additional spare capacity in the winter peak demand period.

                    [post_content] =&gt; The arrival of the first Russian LNG supplies to the UK coincided with the deterioration of UK-Russia diplomatic relations, triggering debates over the role of Russia in UK hydro<mark>carbon</mark> imports. Although Russia is the largest supplier of UK coal imports, coal is being phased out of UK energy consumption. Russia is just one of several substantial suppliers of crude oil and refined oil products to the UK, with levels of UK oil demand being strongly linked to developments in the UK transportation fuel mix. By contrast, natural gas is the largest source of UK heat and power generation, and underpins non-transportation sector energy consumption. UK gas import demand is currently largely met by pipeline imports from Norway and LNG imports from Qatar. However, as the UK seeks to cope with fluctuations in domestic gas demand through increased LNG imports and gas trade with north-western Europe, following the closure of the UK’s only seasonal gas storage facility, the challenge to UK energy security is not dependence on Russian gas supplies but rather increasing exposure to international gas market volatility.

                    [post_content] =&gt; <mark>Gazprom</mark> has confounded many expectations by enjoying two record years of gas sales in Europe in 2016 and 2017. External factors have certainly played a role in its success, with overall European demand rebounding, indigenous production continuing to fall and alternative sources of imports failing to deliver at the expected levels (especially LNG). In addition, <mark>Gazprom</mark> has demonstrated  a level of flexibility in its pricing strategy that has kept its gas very competitive, with the result that its market share in Europe has grown to 35%. However, the anticipation that this figure could rise towards 40% and above has led EU politicians and policy-makers to become concerned about over-dependence on Russian gas, and many now wish to ensure that <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s future options are limited by obstructing potential new pipelines. In addition the politics surrounding Ukraine, the imposition of stricter US sanctions, questions surrounding  the DG COMP investigation into <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s activities and the Stockholm arbitration ruling over contracts with Ukraine add further layers of complexity. This paper therefore explores whether <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s two <EM>anni mirabiles</EM> in 2016 and 2017 can be repeated or whether Russian gas faces a more challenging environment in the rest of the decade.

Nord Stream 2, as the project is called, has provoked controversy in Europe – but the pipeline is planned to be in use as soon as 2019. Supporters of Nord Stream 2 make two bold claims: Ukraine is apparently an untrustworthy partner for gas transit, and Europe supposedly needs more Russian gas. Both arguments are questionable, and there are good reasons to put the project on ice.</P><P>First of all, transporting gas through Ukraine is not a major supply risk for Europe. It is almost impossible to imagine that today’s Ukraine would even consider interrupting the flow of gas to the EU. After all, Ukraine benefits greatly from the EU’s political and economic support. Kiev would not want to jeopardise that. Moreover, any break in gas transit would provoke the building of a pipeline avoiding Ukraine, and thereby actually endanger Ukraine’s own gas supply. This is because Ukraine gets a third of its gas supplies from the EU, in the form of reimports from Slovakia.</P><P>On the other hand, Ukraine would be sure to see the building of Nord Stream 2 as a clear sign of distrust from Europe. Indeed, Ukraine has redoubled its efforts to reform its gas sector, and the changes are already bearing fruit. The state-owned gas company needs much less public subsidy, and gas consumption is massively reduced. Western gas companies are setting up in the Ukrainian market, and there is justified hope that in some years Ukraine will be able to meet all its own gas needs from domestic production.</P><P>Without gas transit through Ukraine, EU countries would not really have enough gas to supply Ukraine from the west. These supplies consist overwhelmingly of gas that originally flowed into Slovakia through Ukraine. Therefore, bypassing Ukraine with Nord Stream 2 would force Kiev to return to buying gas directly from <mark>Gazprom</mark>. This dependant relationship would probably be more than just economic in nature. Is that really a situation that the EU wants to encourage?</P><P>The second main argument for Nord Stream 2 is that falling gas production in north-west Europe makes additional infrastructure for Russian imports necessary. But increasing needs can be met for at least the next decade using existing pipelines: in 2014 there was 100 billion m<SUP>3</SUP> of unused capacity from Russia. What’s more, renewable energies and improvements in energy efficiency offer hope that gas demand might actually fall. Even if the need for imports does suddenly shoot up, Europe is still in no danger of a gas supply crisis. Necessary extra gas can easily be imported from overseas at any time using the existing liquid gas terminals.</P><P>In fact, Nord Stream 2 could weaken Europe’s resolve to find alternatives to Russian gas. <mark>Gazprom</mark> would surely try to use the new pipeline at full capacity, and the constant stream of gas could be flexibly priced to react to any competition. This would make the development of other supplies and energy sources difficult over the coming decades.</P><P>Nord Stream 2 is of strategic importance for Russia and the EU, in terms of both energy and geopolitics. But the interests of the two partners do not neatly overlap. Building the pipeline too soon would leave Ukraine dependent on direct Russian gas exports, and hinder the search for alternative supplies in Europe. In any case, risks around transit or demand over the next 5-10 years seem to be manageable with the existing infrastructure.</P><P>So the best idea is simply to wait on making the decision. If it becomes clear that a route bypassing Ukraine is needed, or additional imports become necessary, the plan can always be taken back down from the shelf. But for the moment the project would do the EU more harm than good.</P><DIV class=""republishing""><H4>Republishing and referencing</H4><P>Bruegel considers itself a public good and takes no institutional standpoint.</P><P>Due to copyright agreements we ask that you kindly email request to republish opinions that have appeared in print to <A href=""mailto:communication@bruegel.org"">communication@bruegel.org</A>.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></BODY></HTML>","2","2","Positive"

REUTERS/Hardi Baktiantoro/Files</P></SPAN></FIGCAPTION></DIV></DIV><P>A year later, the project is close to collapse, a casualty of labyrinthine Indonesian bureaucracy, opaque laws and a secretive palm oil company.  </P><P>The Rimba Raya project, on the island of Borneo, is part of a United Nations-backed scheme designed to reward poorer nations that protect their <mark>carbon</mark>-rich jungles.  </P><P>Deep peat in some of Indonesia’s rainforests stores billions of tonnes of <mark>carbon</mark> so preserving those forests is regarded as crucial in the fight against <mark>climate change</mark>.  </P><P>By putting a value on the <mark>carbon</mark>, the 90,000-hectare (225,000 acre) project would help prove that investors can turn a profit from the world’s jungles in ways that do not involve cutting them down.  </P><P>After three years of work, more than $2 million in development costs, and what seemed like the green light from Jakarta, the project is proof that saving the world’s tropical rainforests will be far more complicated than simply setting up a framework to allow market forces to function.  </P><P>A Reuters investigation into the case also shows the forestry ministry is highly skeptical about a market for forest <mark>carbon</mark> credits, placing it at odds with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who supports pay-and-preserve investments to fight <mark>climate change</mark>.  </P><P>Hong Kong-based Lemons, 47, a veteran of environmentally <mark>sustainable</mark>, and profitable, projects, discovered just how frustrating the ministry can be to projects such as his.  </P><P>“Success was literally two months around the corner,” he said. “We went through — if there are 12 steps, we went through the first 11 on time over a 2-year period. We had some glitches, but by and large we went through the rather lengthy and complicated process in the time expected.”</P><P>That’s when the forestry ministry decided to slash the project’s area in half, making it unviable, and handing a large chunk of forested deep peatland to a palm oil company for development.  </P><P>The case is a stark reminder to Norway’s government, the world’s top donor to projects to protect tropical forests, on just how tough it will be to preserve Indonesia’s rainforests under its $1 billion <mark>climate</mark> deal with Jakarta.  </P><H3>UNLIMITED CORRUPTION  </H3><P>The dispute has turned a spotlight on Indonesia’s forestry ministry, which earns $15 billion a year in land permit fees from investors. Indonesia’s Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) said last month it will investigate the granting of forest permits and plans to crack down on corruption in the resources sector.  </P><P>“It’s a source of unlimited corruption,” said Chandra M. Hamzah, deputy chairman at the KPK.  </P><P>Indonesia Corruption Watch, a private watchdog, says illegal logging and violations in issuing forest use permits are rampant. It estimates ill-gotten gains total about 20 trillion rupiah ($2.3 billion) each year.  </P><P>A forest ministry official connected with the U.N.-backed forest <mark>carbon</mark> offset scheme was sentenced in April to three years in prison for accepting a $10,000 bribe to ensure an Indonesian company won a procurement tender.  </P><P>Wandojo Siswanto was one of the negotiators for Indonesia’s delegation at the 2009 U.N. <mark>climate</mark> talks in Copenhagen, despite being a bribery suspect. His case has highlighted concerns about the capacity of the forestry ministry to manage forest-<mark>carbon</mark> projects.  </P><P>The forestry sector has a long history of mismanagement and graft. Former trade and industry minister Bob Hasan, a timber czar during the Suharto years, was fined 50 billion rupiah ($7 million) for ordering the burning of forests in Sumatra and then imprisoned in a separate case of forestry fraud after Suharto was toppled from power in 1998.  </P><P>In an interview in Jakarta, senior forestry ministry officials denied any wrongdoing in the Rimba Raya case and criticized the project’s backers for a deal they made with Russia’s <mark>Gazprom</mark>, the world’s largest gas producer, to market the project’s <mark>carbon</mark> credits.  </P><P>Internal forestry ministry documents that Reuters obtained show how the ministry reversed its support for the project after a new minister came in, and a large chunk of the project’s land was turned over to a palm oil firm.  </P><P>The case illustrates how growing demand for land, bureaucratic hurdles and powerful vested interests are major obstacles to conservation projects in Indonesia and elsewhere in the developing world.  </P><P>That makes it hard for these projects to compete and navigate through multiple layers of government with the potential for interference and delay.  </P><P>“We have systematically not been able to demonstrate that we can complete the loop to turn projects into dollar investments,” said Andrew Wardell, program director, forests and governance, at the Center for International Forestry Research in Indonesia.  </P><P>“Which is why the palm oil industry is winning hands down every time.”</P><H3>SHOWCASE PROJECT  </H3><P>The Rimba Raya project was meant to save a large area of <mark>carbon</mark>-rich peat swamp forest in Central Kalimantan province and showcase Jakarta’s efforts to fight <mark>climate change</mark>.  </P><P>Much of the area is dense forest that lies atop oozy black peat flooded by tea-colored water. Dozens of threatened or endangered species such as orangutans, proboscis monkeys, otter civets and Borneo bay cats live in the area, which is adjacent to a national park.  </P><P>Rimba Raya was designed to be part of the U.N’s Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) program. The idea is simple: every tonne of <mark>carbon</mark> locked away in the peat and soaked up by the trees would earn a steady flow of <mark>carbon</mark> credits.  </P><P>Profit from the sale of those credits would go to project investors and partners, local communities and the Indonesian government. That would allow the project to pay its way and compete with palm oil farmers and loggers who might otherwise destroy it.  </P><P>Rich countries and big companies can buy the credits to offset their emissions.  </P><DIV class=""container_1tVQo"" tabindex=""-1""><FIGCAPTION><SPAN class=""caption_KoNH1""><P>Birute Mary Galdikas, the founder of Orangutan Foundation International (OFI), visits a feeding station at OFI's orangutan care and quarantine centre in Pangkalan Bun in the province of Central Kalimantan in this undated handout photo courtesy of InfiniteEARTH. REUTERS/InfiniteEARTH/Handout</P></SPAN></FIGCAPTION></DIV><P>By preserving a large area of peat swamp forest, Rimba Raya was projected to cut <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by nearly 100 million tonnes over its 30-year life, which would translate into total saleable credits of about $500 million, <mark>Gazprom</mark> says.  </P><P>It would also be a sanctuary for orphaned or rehabilitated orangutans from elsewhere in Borneo. Rimba Raya teamed up with the founder of Orangutan Foundation International, Birute Mary Galdikas, in which OFI would receive a steady income from annual <mark>carbon</mark> credit sales.  </P><P>It was the sort of project President Yudhoyono and Norway have pledged to support. Yudhoyono has put forests — Indonesia is home to the world’s third-largest forest lands — at the center of a pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 26 percent by 2020.  </P><P>He tasked a senior adviser to press for reforms to make REDD projects easier and for greater transparency at the forestry ministry.  </P><H3>GOLD STANDARD  </H3><P>Rimba Raya was poised for success. It got backing from the Clinton Foundation’s <mark>Climate</mark> Initiative, which helped pay for some of the early costs. <mark>Gazprom</mark> invested more than $1 million.  </P><P>It was the first in the world to meet stringent REDD project rules under the Washington-based Voluntary <mark>Carbon</mark> Standard, an industry-respected body that issues <mark>carbon</mark> credits. Rimba Raya was also the first to earn a triple-gold rating under the <mark>Climate</mark>, Community and Biodiversity Alliance, a separate verifier.  </P><P>Companies including German insurer Allianz and Japanese telecoms giant NTT pledged to buy credits from the project if it gets its license.  </P><P>In December 2009, the forestry ministry tentatively named the now Indonesian-registered company PT Rimba Raya Conservation the license holder for nearly 90,000 ha, contingent on it passing an environmental impact assessment. It did so a few months later.  </P><P>The ownership of PT Rimba Raya Conservation is split 70 percent foreign and 30 percent Indonesian, with Lemons and business partner Jim Procanik holding small stakes.  </P><P>Lemons is CEO of Hong Kong-based firm InfiniteEARTH, which is the developer and manager of the Rimba Raya project as well as investment fund-raiser. Procanik, 44, is the managing director.  </P><P>In June last year, Forestry Minister Zulkifli Hasan asked for a map that would set the final boundary of the project, according to a copy of the instruction seen by Reuters. This mandatory step normally takes a few weeks. Once the map is issued, a project is eligible for a license to operate.  </P><P>But by September last year it was clear something was wrong, according to Lemons. Despite repeated promises by ministry officials, the final map had not been issued. No explanations were given.  </P><P>“No one has ever said, ‘No’. So that’s exhausting,” said Lemons.  </P><P>What followed instead was a series of steps by the forestry ministry that have resulted in the project being undermined.  </P><P>A ministry review focused on conflicting claims to the land by several companies belonging to palm oil firm, PT Best Group.  </P><P>PT Best, which is run by Indonesian brothers Winarto and Winarno Tjajadi, had long coveted the peat land within the area the forestry ministry set aside for the Rimba Raya project.  </P><P>On December 31, 2010, PT Best was granted 6,500 ha of peat swamp land for palm oil development, next to a smaller parcel of deep peat land granted a year earlier — part of PT Best’s broader plan to connect its palm oil plantations in the north with a port on the coast nearby. The land granted last December was part of the original area set aside for Rimba Raya.  </P><P>The Tjajadi brothers declined several requests by Reuters to comment.  </P><P>The December allocation to PT Best came despite assurances from Forestry Minister Hasan that he would not allow deep peatlands to be converted for agriculture.  </P><P>The allocation also came a day before a two-year moratorium on issuing licenses to clear primary forests and peat lands was due to start on January 1 this year. The moratorium is a key part of the <mark>climate</mark> deal with Norway.  </P><P>After months of delay, the forestry ministry finally ruled that PT Rimba Raya was only eligible for 46,000 ha, a decision that cut out much of the peatlands covering nearly half the original project area.  </P><H3>OMBUDSMAN INVESTIGATES  </H3><P>The case has now been brought before the office of the Indonesian government’s Ombudsman. In an interview, senior Ombudsman Dominikus Fernandes told Reuters he believed the forestry ministry should issue the license to Rimba Raya.  </P><P>“If Rimba Raya has already fulfilled the criteria, there should not be a delay in issuing the license,” he said.  </P><P>“This is a model project in Indonesia that should be prioritized. If we don’t give an example on the assurance of investing in Indonesia, that’s not a good thing.”</P><P>Officials from the forestry ministry, in a lengthy interview with Reuters, said the area was given legally for palm oil development because PT Best had claims to the land dating back to 2005.  </P><P>Secretary-General of the ministry Hadi Daryanto stressed the peatland areas originally granted to Rimba Raya were on a type of forest called convertible production forest, which can be used for agriculture but not REDD projects. Handing that nearly 40,000 ha to Rimba Raya would be against the law, he said.  </P><DIV class=""inline-container_1QqKC mega_19SOz""><FIGCAPTION class=""caption_2BUXy"">Slideshow<SPAN class=""count_3OPtf""> (7 Images)</SPAN></FIGCAPTION></DIV><P>Yet in 2009, the ministry was ordered to make the title switch for this same area of peatland so it could be used for a REDD project. The instruction to immediately make the switch, a bureaucratic formality, was never acted on.  </P><P>In the Oct 2009 decree seen by Reuters, former Forestry Minister H.M.S. Kaban issued the order as part of a broader instruction setting aside the nearly 90,000 ha for ecosystem restoration projects. Kaban left office soon after.  </P><P>Indonesian law also bans any clearing of peat lands more than 3 meters deep. An assessment of the Rimba Raya area by a peat expert hired by InfiniteEARTH showed the peat is 3 to 7 meters deep, so in theory was out of bounds for PT Best to clear for agriculture.  </P><P>For Lemons, 47, the mood has switched from exhilaration to bitter disappointment. “We’ve been here every day pushing like hell from every angle,” he said.  </P><P>Procanik says the disappointment is personal. “Todd and I have both invested what savings we had for our kids’ college education in this project,” he said.  </P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> is also upset.  </P><P>In a letter dated June 16 to the Indonesian government, the Russian firm criticized the ministry’s failure to issue the license for Rimba Raya and threatened to abandon clean-energy projects in Indonesia estimated to be worth more than $100 million in foreign investment. The government has yet to respond.  </P><H3><mark>CARBON</mark> DREAMS?  </H3><P>Secretary-General Daryanto and Iman Santoso, Director-General for forestry business management, said another major problem was InfiniteEARTH’s deal with <mark>Gazprom</mark>, which was made in the absence of any license.  </P><P>“We didn’t know about the contract with <mark>Gazprom</mark>. They had no legal right to make the contract,” Daryanto told Reuters.  </P><P>Santoso described it as the project’s “fatal mistake.”</P><P>Daryanto also questioned whether REDD would ever work and whether there was any global appetite for <mark>carbon</mark> credits the program generates, a view at odds with other parts of the Indonesian government, which has been actively supporting REDD projects.  </P><P>“Who will pay for the dream of Rimba Raya? Who will pay? Nobody, sir!” Daryanto told Reuters during an interview in the heavily forested ministry compound near central Jakarta.  </P><P>Lemons said the <mark>Gazprom</mark> deal was explained in person during a presentation of a 300-page technical proposal submitted to the ministry to prove the project would be financially viable. Daryanto was among a ministry panel that approved the proposal.  </P><P>“One of their biggest concerns was whether REDD could deliver the same revenues to the state as other land-use permits such as palm oil, logging, mining. We were required to show contracts that demonstrated we could pay the fees and annual royalties,” he said.  </P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark>, designated as the sole marketer of <mark>carbon</mark> credits from Rimba Raya, said it had already agreed long-term sales contracts with buyers at between 7 and 8 euros ($10 to $11.40) per tonne — contingent on the license being issued.  </P><P>“We’ve sold to four or five companies around that price,” said Dan Barry, <mark>Gazprom</mark> Marketing &amp; Trading’s London-based global director of clean energy.  </P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> became involved, he said, because it was a project that looked to have official support. The Russian company agreed to a financing mechanism that ensured the project’s viability for 30 years, regardless of the price level of <mark>carbon</mark> markets.  </P><P>Those markets, centered on the European and U.N. <mark>carbon</mark> trading programs, were valued at $142 billion in 2010, the World Bank says. National <mark>carbon</mark> trading schemes are planned for Australia and South Korea, while California is planning a state-based scheme from 2013. New Zealand’s <mark>carbon</mark> market started in 2008.  </P><P>“If you ever want a successful REDD scheme, you are going to have to have a process that people believe in,” Barry said.  </P><P>“The Ministry of Forestry ought to be doing everything it can to support a program that benefits forestry as opposed to favor a program that’s there to cut it down and turn it into palm oil.”</P><H3>“AHEAD OF ITS TIME”</H3><P>Kuntoro Mangkusubroto, the head of the REDD task force in Indonesia who is also in charge of the president’s government reforms unit, said the Rimba Raya case highlighted deep flaws in the bureaucracy and the need for sweeping reforms to underpin the 40 other REDD projects in Indonesia.  </P><P>“The core concern is the trust in government statements of readiness, and responsibility,” he told Reuters in an email. “Even with the best of intentions, the unsynchronous action of the central government’s ministry and the district government’s action is not conducive for investment, especially in this new kind of venture.  </P><P>“I can surmise that the case of Rimba Raya is a case of a business idea that is ahead of its time. The government infrastructure is insufficiently ready for it.”</P><P>Legal action was one solution to this case, he added.  </P><P>That is a path Lemons and Procanik may eventually take but for now they have proposed a land swap deal with PT Best in which the firm gives PT Rimba Raya 9,000 ha of peat land in return for a similar sized piece of non-peat land held by PT Rimba Raya in the north of the project near other PT Best landholdings.  </P><P>PT Best rejected an earlier offer by Rimba Raya of 9 percent of the credits from the project, Lemons said.  </P><P>Based on recent satellite images, PT Best has yet to develop the disputed 9,000 ha area.  </P><P>The delays mean it is too late for Rimba Raya to become the world’s first project to issue REDD credits. That accolade has since gone to a Kenyan project.  </P><P>“Our whole point here is to show host countries that REDD can pay its way,” said Lemons. “And if it can’t pay its way then we haven’t proven anything.”</P><P>In a sign a resolution could still be possible, Ombudsman Fernandes, Forestry Minister Hasan and PT Rimba Raya are scheduled to meet on Aug 19.  </P><DIV class=""container_28wm1""><DIV class=""attribution_o4ojT""><P class=""content_27_rw"">Additional reporting by Olive Rondonuwu and Yayat Supriatna in Jakarta and Harry Suhartono in Singapore; Editing by Simon Webb, Simon Robinson and Bill Tarrant</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>","2","2","Positive"

the wake of the recent signing of the US-China deal on <mark>carbon</mark> emissions, Russia
is once again seen as a global outlier. Given Moscow’s lack of interest in
leading the <mark>climate</mark> battle, statements depicting Russia as the loser in this
development appear exaggerated.</P><P>Yet,
in the midst of excitement about the Obama-Xi <mark>climate</mark> accord, it is easy to
forget that 10 years ago Russia surprised the international community by
joining the Kyoto Protocol – a binding multilateral <mark>climate</mark> treaty that committed rich nations (at the time excluding
China and India, two of the largest greenhouse gas
polluters) to a moderate five percent average
reduction in emissions relative to 1990. The Kyoto Protocol is still the world’s only internationally binding
agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. On that
occasion, it was <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s new-found interest in the prestige of becoming
a ‘great ecological power’ (<EM>velikaya ekologicheskaya derzhava</EM>) that enticed Russia to endorse
the deal.</P><H2><STRONG>A great ecological power</STRONG></H2><P>But
why exactly did Russia join the Kyoto Protocol in 2004?  Many
observers speculated on this question: Russia has never championed
environmental protection on a global scale. During the lengthy pre-ratification
period, most Russian scientists remained ambivalent about the effects of global
warming. Meanwhile, Russia’s metallurgic sector has traditionally been among
the most energy intensive in the world. Until recently, the practice of flaring
natural gas was not seen as a worrisome practice. </P><P><EM class=""mag-quote-right"">Russia has never championed
environmental protection on a global scale.</EM></P><P>In
the early 2000s, both opponents and  supporters of the Kyoto Protocol tended to
view the commitment through the lens of the Russian economy and the country’s
national priorities. Ahead of the deal, two contrasting forces prevailed. </P><P>Russia
faced enormous challenges in terms of reviving its economy. It therefore
supported the argument advanced by other big emitters and transition economies
like China, Brazil, and India. These countries argued that they still hoped to
achieve the kind of economic development the West had been enjoying for
decades. Thus, they were unwilling to support any <mark>climate</mark> deal that would
hamper the attainment of that goal. </P><P>In
contrast, Russia did not want to lose the opportunity to add to its reputation
as a rising power on the world stage. Torn between the ‘developing country’ and
the ‘great power’ narrative, Russia’s ratification went through a long domestic
struggle before the final decision was made. Considering this domestic
bargaining and the country’s traditional low regard for environmental issues,
unpacking the incentives behind Russia’s ratification of the Kyoto protocol
becomes all the more interesting.</P><P><SPAN class=""wysiwyg_imageupload image imgupl_floating_none 0""><SPAN class=""image_meta""><SPAN class=""image_title"">The Kyoto Protocol logotype. Image: Marco Parilla via Wikipedia. Some Rights Reserved</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P>Initially,
many business groups opposed the treaty on the grounds that it would hamper the
growth of Russia’s economy. Certain academics even questioned the scientific
foundations of the Kyoto Protocol altogether. On the other side of the spectrum,
an eminent scientist, Nikolai Klyuev, from the Geographical Institute at the
Russian Academy of Sciences, introduced the idea of Russia as a ‘great ecological
power’. </P><P>In
line with Russia’s self-identification as a Great Power, and President Putin’s
strengthened national-patriotic ideology, the country welcomed the opportunity
to boost its image as a great ecological nation. </P><H2><STRONG>Putin’s hesitation </STRONG></H2><P>However,
in 2002, following the disappointment over the US withdrawal, Putin’s hesitance
became protracted. For Putin, the question of ratification had always been
political rather than environmental. In other words, the decision was guided by
the ‘relative gains’, which Kyoto could provide. </P><P>Subsequent
to the US rejection of the treaty, Russia’s economic interests in the Kyoto
Protocol decreased substantially, as it was left without a major buyer for its
emissions surplus. Moreover, some observers pointed out that if even a
rich country like the US was worried about the treaty’s economic impact, a
country such as Russia could ill afford it. Putin’s economic policy adviser,
Andrei Illarionov, was the most vocal among the critics. </P><P>Yet,
comparing Russia and the United States was misleading – the two countries were
in diametrically opposed positions. If the US had moved to ratify, the US would
have been obliged to take action to cut emissions, while Russia would actually
have gained through ratification due to sales of its surplus allowances.</P><P>Be
that as it may, after the US withdrawal, the EU undertook to save the protocol
by successfully rounding up enough signatories for the protocol to enter into
force in February 2005. Crucial to this was the EU’s diplomatic effort with
Russia. With the US’s refusal to join the treaty, only Russia carried the
weight to carry the treaty across the 55 % hurdle, that is, the combined percentage of
the industrialised world’s greenhouse gas emissions. By 2003, the industrialised
states that had ratified the Kyoto Protocol represented 44 % of these
emissions. Russia, if it also ratified the protocol, would add a further (critical)
17 % to this figure. </P><H2><STRONG>Political leverage</STRONG></H2><P>The
decisive role of Russia in the enforcement of global <mark>climate policy</mark> gave it
political leverage. In fact, to secure Russia’s participation, the country was
given more sink allowances, which effectively relaxed the emissions constraints
previously negotiated in Kyoto. The huge amount of <mark>pollution</mark> credits that Russia
won under the Kyoto’s emission trading system was the decisive concession, which
made Russia respond to the EU’s campaign of persuasion. </P><P>Many
observers speculated that Russia’s ratification of the protocol was a <EM>quid
pro quo</EM> for the EU’s support for its application to join the World
Trade Organisation (WTO). Besides the economic incentives, other contributing
factors included the political opportunity to boost Russia’s status while
leaving the Bush administration increasingly isolated internationally on
<mark>climate change</mark> issues. While these incentives could have played a role, they
pale in comparison to the key incentive: economic gains offered in <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s
favour. <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s support came from the realisation of the enormous profits it
could gain from selling unused emission credits, and investing these revenues
in clean technologies for the ‘greening’ of Russia’s economy.</P><P>Though
WTO accession loomed in the background, the decision to join Kyoto had much
more to do with the direct economic benefits Russia could extract from the
treaty than with considerations regarding WTO membership. <mark>Climate policy</mark> experts
estimated that Russia  benefited from the
protocol by roughly 10 billion dollars annually through emission trading, joint
investment projects, and increased foreign investments. The protocol set a zero
reduction target for Russia, meaning that Russian emissions could not exceed
the level of 1990 between 2008 and 2012, the first commitment period of the
agreement.</P><P class=""pullquote-right""><mark>Climate policy</mark> experts estimated that Russia benefited from the protocol by roughly 10 billion dollars annually.</P><P>Indeed,
Russia could actually increase emissions, or sell its excess emission
allowances to other states within the protocol without violating the agreement.
In 2003, the otherwise sceptical Russian corporate sector began to express
interest in the ‘capitalisation’ of climatic benefits. Alongside other energy
companies, <mark>Gazprom</mark> adopted this line of argument. Not by chance, by mid-2004,the
single most insistent lobbyist in favour of the agreement was <mark>Gazprom</mark>.</P><H2><STRONG><mark>Gazprom</mark> gains</STRONG></H2><P><mark>Gazprom</mark>
gained from Kyoto for a number of reasons. Firstly, the company saw the so-called Joint Implementation (JI)
projects as a cheap way of rehabilitating the company through foreign
investments. In 2006, one of <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s first pilot energy-savings projects was
implemented in cooperation with the German company Ruhrgas AG for the optimisation
of gas pipelines and the reduction of fuel gas waste.</P><P><SPAN class=""wysiwyg_imageupload image imgupl_floating_none caption-xlarge""><SPAN class=""image_meta""><SPAN class=""image_title"">A gas flame burns at a gas refinery. Imagine by: Kokhanchikov via Shutterstock (c)</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><P>Secondly,
the industry knew that it could make profits from <mark>carbon</mark> trading due to
Russia's generous emissions targets, especially with the help of improvements
in energy efficiency from JI investment. Since Russia’s energy sector is
notoriously <mark>carbon</mark> intensive, it had vast potential for energy-saving
improvements. </P><P>Thirdly,
<mark>Gazprom</mark> looked forward to an increase in sales of natural gas that, as an environmentally-friendly fuel, would be in high demand from other European Kyoto signatories. An
EU study estimated that the initialisation of the EU Emissions Trading System
alone could boost European demand for natural gas by as much as 6% in the
period 2008–2012, since fuel switching is one of the cheaper short-term options
for industrial enterprises to meet their <mark>CO2</mark> emission caps. As
witnessed by the EU’s present day de-<mark>carbon</mark>isation policy, the centre-piece of
which is natural gas, these expectations have proven correct. </P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark>
also had reputational incentives to support the <mark>climate</mark> regime: on its website,
<mark>Gazprom</mark> listed a range of energy-saving measures, including the optimisation of
transmission system gas flow, the replacement of gas compressor units, and the
implementation of automated control systems, all of which had the goal of
simultaneously improving its image and attracting foreign investment.</P><P>Although
technically controlled by the state, <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s influence inside the Presidential
Administration has always been considerable. In fact, one of the priorities of
the government is to assure the outside world that <mark>Gazprom</mark> conducts its
business effectively, a necessity given the extraordinary amount of rents it
provides for the state. </P><P>Among
the insiders, Dmitry Medvedev (at the time Chairman of <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s Board of Directors)
was also Vladimir Putin’s Chief of Staff, and thus a particularly influential
figure. Russia’s flirtation with Kyoto may have been the consequence of
Medvedev’s policy priorities, which in turn were closely related to <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s
economic incentives.</P><H2><STRONG>Political fanfare </STRONG></H2><P>As
soon as Medvedev became president in 2008, he signed a decree increasing energy
efficiency. Yet, the main instrument for achieving this goal of reduced energy
usage in the economy would be the gradual increase of regulated domestic prices
on gas, a scheme that, once again, suited the interests of <mark>Gazprom</mark> far more
than it promoted energy-saving technologies.</P><P class=""pullquote-right"">As with many other Medvedev initiatives, the action plan remained on the level of political fanfare.</P><P>Moreover,
in May 2009, Russia officially adopted a <mark>Climate</mark> Doctrine, which committed the
country to eradicating the sources of <mark>climate change</mark> in its ‘own way’.
Initially, it was hoped that Medvedev’s energy-efficiency plan would offer real
potential for reducing greenhouse gases. Yet, as with many other Medvedev
initiatives, the action plan remained on the level of political fanfare rather
than a practical policy document. At the time of writing, the <mark>Climate</mark> Doctrine
has no legal standing and has not provided any concrete measures to mitigate
<mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>In
sum, Russia expected its <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by 2008 to decrease by 20% from 1990 levels.  In 2010, the country’s <mark>carbon</mark> emissions stood at 34.2 % below
their 1990 level – a notable track record. However, these reductions had not
been the outcome of focused policies to cut emissions. The decrease in
emissions was principally due to the economic decline that followed Russia’s
transition to a market economy after the collapse of the Soviet system. The
economic downturn shuttered factories, shrunk agriculture, and the re-growth of
forests sequestered more <mark>carbon</mark>.</P><P>But
the same card cannot be played in perpetuity. After Russia joined  the WTO in 2012, there were no further
incentives that would keep it on board. In fact, as of 2011, Russia gave notice
it would not enter into the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.
Moscow’s preference, shared by Japan and Canada, is for a new global agreement
that obliges all major emitters to participate, meaning that today the Kyoto
protocol covers no more than 16% of global emissions. </P><H2><STRONG>Agency and redemption </STRONG></H2><P>The success of the US-China
declaration on <mark>climate</mark>, raises hopes for the upcoming Paris <mark>climate</mark> talks, but
it also demonstrates two important points. Firstly, the Chinese Communist Party
has staked its legitimacy and political survival on raising the environmental
standards of average Chinese. Secondly, Obama is taking great pains to restore
his fortunes and reinvigorate his presidency; and <mark>climate policy</mark> is one aspect.</P><P>Most recently, at the UN’s latest round of
<mark>climate</mark> talks in Lima, Russia surprised many observers by strongly supporting
the draft for a new global deal, to be signed
in Paris, in a year. Putting rhetoric to one side, Russia has continued
with negotiations as is usual by choosing to remain isolated, and letting the US, China,
and India take the lion’s share of the blame for the current lack of progress. </P><P class=""pullquote-right"">Russia has shown very little
agency in the <mark>climate</mark> battle  </P><P>But now, with
China finally ready to work on <mark>climate change</mark>, India has become the
single-biggest wild card ahead of the Paris talks in December 2015. At present,
India has adopted an intransigent position on further
emission reductions. But if <mark>climate</mark> negotiators want a truly global agreement,
they will have to bring India on board. </P><P>In this constellation, there
is some room for Russian redemption. A decade after talking about becoming
a ‘great ecological power’, the country has shown very little agency in the
<mark>climate</mark> battle and has left the international <mark>climate</mark> community generally
unimpressed. However,
if Russia’s declared plan to cut emissions is genuine, the country could restore its international
standing by attracting followers in the BRICS, especially by enticing India,
which Putin has been courting since the escalation of geopolitical
tensions with the West. Undoubtedly,
Putin’s new-found relationship with Narendra Modi is strongly related to
Russia’s power struggle over Ukraine.<SPAN> </SPAN></P><P>

Despite this underlying geopolitical motivation, if cosy relations between Russia and
India result in a change of New Delhi’s stance on <mark>climate change</mark>, Moscow will regain
some legitimacy in the <mark>climate</mark> battle, and perhaps find that it has given the world
some hope in this fractious period of renewed tension.</P><P><EM>Standfirst Image: <mark>Gazprom</mark> offices in Russia.

By <U><A href=""https://mlexmarketinsight.com/expertise/contributors/matthew-newman"">Matthew Newman</A></U>.</H4><P>The EU hasn't been shy in unleashing its tough antitrust laws against even the most powerful and well connected of companies — including Russia's natural gas giant <mark>Gazprom</mark>. But when it comes to government-to-government agreements, the EU watchdog says its hands are tied.</P><P>That's the message coming from today's two-pronged announcement from Margrethe Vestager. The EU's antitrust chief reminded journalists that while she has been able to demand and obtain concessions from <mark>Gazprom</mark> on its supply of natural gas, she just doesn't have the power to deal with certain government deals.</P><P>Today, Vestager was obliged to admit that Russia's agreement with Poland had led her to drop objections to <mark>Gazprom</mark>'s control over a crucial pipeline crossing the country. &quot;As regards the Yamal pipeline, the situation cannot be changed by antitrust procedure,&quot; she conceded.</P><P>Yet when it comes to the state-backed <mark>Gazprom</mark>, there is a fine line between state and non-state actors — and the European Commission knows this well.</P><P>Since the EU regulator began its investigation of <mark>Gazprom</mark> in 2012, company officials have argued that the bloc has no jurisdiction to apply European antitrust law because the gas giant is under the Russian government's control.</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> argued that its conduct in Eastern Europe is governed by agreements between Russia and various Eastern European governments. As a result, <mark>Gazprom</mark> has been acting under the direct responsibility of Russia. Under EU rules, antitrust rules don't apply to governments.</P><P>The commission has steadfastly rejected these arguments — and the regulator's seven-week &quot;market test&quot; asking rivals and customers to respond to <mark>Gazprom</mark>'s commitments to change contracts and free gas flows suggests it is having some success.</P><P>But when it comes to gas deals underpinned by solid, state-to-state arrangements, Vestager has had to throw in the towel. And in the case of the Yamal pipeline, that's a galling realization, given that the Danish antitrust chief has real concerns.</P><H4>Market test</H4><P>The commission's market test, announced today, follows <mark>Gazprom</mark>'s offer to change contracts to allow customers to sell Russian gas crossing their borders to a third countries. For example, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia may want to sell their Russian gas to a Baltic country or Bulgaria.</P><P>The commission has been investigating these contract restrictions, believing they artificially carve up markets along national boundaries.</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark>'s concessions on this issue suggest the commission has made progress.</P><P>In a statement today, the company's deputy chairman, Alexander Medvedev, said <mark>Gazprom</mark> hopes &quot;the commission — and ultimately the markets — will respond positively to our proposal, which should allow moving the procedure forward and closing the case in the near future.&quot;</P><P>But the commission has also raised concerns that the Russian gas supplier used its market muscle as a gas supplier to control access to gas infrastructure. And this has proven problematic.</P><P>In particular, the regulator probed <mark>Gazprom</mark>'s supply agreements with Poland's state-controlled oil and gas company PGNiG that included an obligation for <mark>Gazprom</mark> to maintain control over the Yamal pipeline.</P><P>Yamal carries gas 4,196 kilometers from the vast gas fields of Western Siberia through Belarus and Poland, to customers in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.</P><P>In its official charge sheet — Statement of Objections — the commission found that control over the Yamal pipeline was governed by an agreement between Poland and Russia. This agreement mandated <mark>Gazprom</mark> to keep control over the pipeline.</P><P>And that's where the commission's competition enforcement came unstuck.</P><H4>Compelled by the state</H4><P>In the Yamal case, <mark>Gazprom</mark> was able to argue that it was acting under &quot;state compulsion&quot; and wasn't responsible for its behavior. Under EU rules, antitrust law can't be applied when companies' decisions are dictated by agreements between governments.</P><P>State-owned companies often invoke this argument. For example, in the commission's probe of illegal agreements between airlines to fix fees for transporting cargo, some state-owned companies argued in 2008 that antitrust rules couldn't apply because national laws required them to arrange prices with competitors.</P><P>In the <mark>Gazprom</mark> case, EU officials argue that the Polish-Russian agreement applies to only a &quot;narrow&quot; aspect of its case. The commission has successfully asserted its jurisdiction over other aspects of <mark>Gazprom</mark>'s behavior and obliged it to remove control over its infrastructure, they insist.</P><P>Yet today's remarks by Vestager are an admission that, on Yamal, the commission was obliged to concede defeat.</P><P>This and other attempts of the &quot;state compulsion&quot; argument are prompting the EU watchdog to go back to the drawing board with legislation to avoid similar stumbling blocks in the future.</P><P>Under a proposed law, all intergovernmental agreements will be subject to prior scrutiny by the commission. The draft bill was passed by European Parliament earlier this month and now must be approved by EU governments.</P><P>Vestager said today that the proposed legislation &quot;shows that effective competition in Central and Eastern European gas markets of course cannot be achieved by the enforcement of EU competition rules alone.&quot;</P><P>It was a frank acknowledgement on the part of the commission that EU antitrust law can only go so far. In its current form, the legislation can tackle contractual barriers and complaints that <mark>Gazprom</mark> charged excessive prices. But with government agreements, some hurdles still trip up antitrust enforcers.</P><P>That's why the commission needs to scrutinize intergovernmental deals, so companies can't argue that &quot;the state made me do it&quot; and get away with abusing their market dominance.</P><SECTION class=""share-links""><DIV class=""title"">Share this </DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>","0","2","Negative"

              <DIV class=""miscTitle""><mark>Carbon</mark> Briefing: Russian energy giant <mark>Gazprom</mark> seeks to re-establish itself with new gas pipeline</DIV></DIV><P>Is the Russian energy giant <mark>Gazprom</mark> reeling or rising? On the same day last week, the Guardian reported <A href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7806870.stm""><mark>Gazprom</mark> was “reeling</A>” in the wake of the US gas revolution, while the Financial Times said that  <A href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cab278c8-2f38-11e2-b8c5-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2CNbQKu8Y""> <mark>Gazprom</mark> has cemented its “hegemonic role</A>” as Europe’s biggest gas provider because of a deal over a new pipeline.</P><P>So has <mark>Gazprom</mark> lost influence because of the boom in the gas market in the US, or does this new pipeline secure <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s future as a major player in the global energy market? Or is it a bit of both?</P><P><STRONG>The South Stream pipeline</STRONG></P><P>The planned new gas pipeline – called South Stream – will run from Russia, under the Black Sea and then divide into two parts in Bulgaria. One part will go through Serbia and Hungary, ending in Austria, the other will go through Greece and end in Italy (the blue line in the image below).</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> has just obtained the green light after Bulgaria – the last country to hold out against the plan – agreed on the condition that <mark>Gazprom</mark> gives it a reduced price for gas from 2013. </P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> decided the route of the pipeline on largely political grounds, and for two main reasons.</P><P>First, it increases Russia’s influence over Ukraine by providing an alternative route for gas provision to Western Europe. About a fifth of the supply of gas from Russia to the rest of the EU currently goes through Ukraine. This has created tension between the two countries, with <mark>Gazprom</mark> <A href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7806870.stm"">shutting off its supply of gas to Ukraine</A> in 2009 for three weeks over a row about <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s prices and Ukraine’s unpaid bills. This in turn led to a drop in the supply of gas <A href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7808937.stm"">to other EU countries</A>.</P><P>Eventually, <A href=""http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/01/21/uk-russia-ukraine-gas-idUKTRE5091KI20090121?sp=true""> Russia agreed to turn the gas supply back on</A>– Ukraine agreed not to raise the price it charges Russia to allow it to keep transporting gas through the pipeline, and Ukraine got a reduced gas price in 2009. The controversy harmed consumer confidence in the relationship between Russia and Ukraine, and gave <mark>Gazprom</mark> a further incentive to look for alternative routes to transport its gas to the rest of Europe.</P><P>Secondly, the South Stream pipeline secures <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s prominent position as a key energy provider in the European gas market in the face of increasingly strong opposition. With the US set to overtake Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world’s largest oil producer by 2035 <A href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7806870.stm"">because of advances in the extraction of shale gas</A>, both <mark>Gazprom</mark> and the Russian government see this as important.</P><P>A flood of US shale gas could reduce both <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s ability to command high prices in the European market and Russia’s ability to negotiate favourable terms in the European political arena based on its status as the principal energy provider. So the South Stream pipeline marks a political win for <mark>Gazprom</mark>.</P><P><STRONG>The problem with gas</STRONG></P><P>But while the South Stream pipeline may help to entrench <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s influence in the European energy markets, securing the route is not without risks.</P><P>The <A href=""http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/05/uk-europe-coal-iea-idUKBRE8940U620121005""> International Energy Agency</A> reports that coal is likely to displace gas as Europe’s primary source of energy through to 2017, but the South Stream pipeline isn’t set to become operational until 2015. Add to that the availability of cheaper US gas, and <mark>Gazprom</mark> is unlikely to enjoy the hold it previously had on the European energy market – at least not at the prices it’s used to charging.</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> also has its own problems. <A href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/nov/15/<mark>gazprom</mark>-chill-shale-gas-revolution""> As the Guardian reports</A>, the company is now playing catch-up to the US, where gas technology and infrastructure for gas is far more developed, leaving the Russian incumbent rushing to replace its ageing network of leaky pipelines and dated extraction equipment.</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark>’s status was further reduced when it shelved plans for a flagship gas pipeline intended to foray into the <A href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ab331568-f1d8-11e1-bba3-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2CNbQKu8Y""> Arctic region</A> because of the technical difficulties in exploring the region and losing the US as chief potential importer because of its own domestic provision.</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> has also been forced to admit that its prices have been consistently <A href=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-11-08/europes-price-vengeance-on-<mark>gazprom</mark>""> too high</A>–<A href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/55c1aeb0-07c6-11e2-9df2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2CNbQKu8Y""> twice as high</A> as the price of gas in the US in September. This is because <mark>Gazprom</mark> links its gas prices to those of oil, rather than competing with the cheaper prices available for natural gas originally intended for the US.</P><P>The European Commission is also <A href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19482312"">investigating <mark>Gazprom</mark></A> for abusing its position as the dominant gas provider in Europe. The EU claims <mark>Gazprom</mark> is restricting the flow of gas to countries that do not cooperate with it (such as Ukraine), is blocking a diversification of the energy supply, and setting the price of gas at unfair levels.</P><P><STRONG><mark>Gazprom</mark>, rising and falling</STRONG></P><P>While the South Stream pipeline has political benefits for <mark>Gazprom</mark> and the Russian government, the company is still on rocky ground: the long-term prospects of gas as part of Europe’s energy mix is uncertain and the European Commission’s investigation could still spell bad news for <mark>Gazprom</mark> itself. So while the South Stream pipeline strengthens <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s position politically, the economic future looks more uncertain. </P></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>","0","2","Neutral"

On the same day last week, the Guardian reported <A href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7806870.stm""><mark>Gazprom</mark> was “reeling</A>” in the wake of the US gas revolution, while the Financial Times said that  <A href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cab278c8-2f38-11e2-b8c5-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2CNbQKu8Y""> <mark>Gazprom</mark> has cemented its “hegemonic role</A>” as Europe’s biggest gas provider because of a deal over a new pipeline.</P><P>So has <mark>Gazprom</mark> lost influence because of the boom in the gas market in the US, or does this new pipeline secure <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s future as a major player in the global energy market? Or is it a bit of both?</P><P><STRONG>The South Stream pipeline</STRONG></P><P>The planned new gas pipeline – called South Stream – will run from Russia, under the Black Sea and then divide into two parts in Bulgaria. One part will go through Serbia and Hungary, ending in Austria, the other will go through Greece and end in Italy (the blue line in the image below).</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> has just obtained the green light after Bulgaria – the last country to hold out against the plan – agreed on the condition that <mark>Gazprom</mark> gives it a reduced price for gas from 2013. </P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> decided the route of the pipeline on largely political grounds, and for two main reasons.</P><P>First, it increases Russia’s influence over Ukraine by providing an alternative route for gas provision to Western Europe. About a fifth of the supply of gas from Russia to the rest of the EU currently goes through Ukraine. This has created tension between the two countries, with <mark>Gazprom</mark> <A href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7806870.stm"">shutting off its supply of gas to Ukraine</A> in 2009 for three weeks over a row about <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s prices and Ukraine’s unpaid bills. This in turn led to a drop in the supply of gas <A href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7808937.stm"">to other EU countries</A>.</P><P>Eventually, <A href=""http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/01/21/uk-russia-ukraine-gas-idUKTRE5091KI20090121?sp=true""> Russia agreed to turn the gas supply back on</A>– Ukraine agreed not to raise the price it charges Russia to allow it to keep transporting gas through the pipeline, and Ukraine got a reduced gas price in 2009. The controversy harmed consumer confidence in the relationship between Russia and Ukraine, and gave <mark>Gazprom</mark> a further incentive to look for alternative routes to transport its gas to the rest of Europe.</P><P>Secondly, the South Stream pipeline secures <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s prominent position as a key energy provider in the European gas market in the face of increasingly strong opposition. With the US set to overtake Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world’s largest oil producer by 2035 <A href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7806870.stm"">because of advances in the extraction of shale gas</A>, both <mark>Gazprom</mark> and the Russian government see this as important.</P><P>A flood of US shale gas could reduce both <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s ability to command high prices in the European market and Russia’s ability to negotiate favourable terms in the European political arena based on its status as the principal energy provider. So the South Stream pipeline marks a political win for <mark>Gazprom</mark>.</P><P><STRONG>The problem with gas</STRONG></P><P>But while the South Stream pipeline may help to entrench <mark>Gazprom</mark>’s influence in the European energy markets, securing the route is not without risks.</P><P>The <A href=""http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/05/uk-europe-coal-iea-idUKBRE8940U620121005""> International Energy Agency</A> reports that coal is likely to displace gas as Europe’s primary source of energy through to 2017, but the South Stream pipeline isn’t set to become operational until 2015. Add to that the availability of cheaper US gas, and <mark>Gazprom</mark> is unlikely to enjoy the hold it previously had on the European energy market – at least not at the prices it’s used to charging.</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> also has its own problems. <A href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/nov/15/<mark>gazprom</mark>-chill-shale-gas-revolution""> As the Guardian reports</A>, the company is now playing catch-up to the US, where gas technology and infrastructure for gas is far more developed, leaving the Russian incumbent rushing to replace its ageing network of leaky pipelines and dated extraction equipment.</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark>’s status was further reduced when it shelved plans for a flagship gas pipeline intended to foray into the <A href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ab331568-f1d8-11e1-bba3-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2CNbQKu8Y""> Arctic region</A> because of the technical difficulties in exploring the region and losing the US as chief potential importer because of its own domestic provision.</P><P><mark>Gazprom</mark> has also been forced to admit that its prices have been consistently <A href=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-11-08/europes-price-vengeance-on-<mark>gazprom</mark>""> too high</A>–<A href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/55c1aeb0-07c6-11e2-9df2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2CNbQKu8Y""> twice as high</A> as the price of gas in the US in September.
