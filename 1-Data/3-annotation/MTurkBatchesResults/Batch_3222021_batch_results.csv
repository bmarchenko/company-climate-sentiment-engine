				Waves crash against a seawall along the Embarcadero in San Francisco in 2010.									<P class=""credits"">Eric Risberg / AP</P></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><DIV class=""entry-content single-post-content""><P>SAN FRANCISCO — Outside a courtroom where a much-anticipated court hearing on <mark>climate</mark> science took place on Wednesday is an old photo of San Francisco’s coastline. Dated 1865, it features an area of the city known as North Beach, which back then was covered in ramshackle wooden houses on a sandy slope nuzzled up against the shore. Since then, the coastline has been extended, filled in with sand (<A href=""https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/making-up-ground/"">and most likely boats and other strange things</A>) to stretch several blocks farther into the brackish waters of the San Francisco Bay. A sea wall, <A href=""http://abc7news.com/politics/san-franciscos-cracking-seawall-needs-$250m-makeover/3235921/"">badly in need of repair</A>, keeps the bay at bay.</P><P>That very sea wall is at the heart of the court case — The People of the State of California v. BP P.L.C. et al. — that was the reason for Wednesday’s spectacle. The cities of Oakland and San Francisco are suing the five biggest fossil fuel companies on the planet — BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil and <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> — for <A href=""http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/environment/article206025399.html"">billions of dollars</A> for past damages and to prevent future flooding from sea level rise. Since the companies extracted fuel that altered the planet, the argument goes, they should pay for the consequences. It’s a modern version of “you break it, you buy it.” The oil companies have filed to dismiss the lawsuit on many grounds, including that it’s the government’s job to set and enforce <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide levels — not theirs.</P><P>On Wednesday, no one was yet on trial. <A href=""https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16503076/oracle-vs-google-judge-william-alsup-interview-waymo-uber"">U.S. District Judge William Alsup</A> made that very clear to the throng of spectators who filled the chambers, a spillover courtroom and the halls outside. Instead, we were there to see a tutorial, an effort to help this self-described “poor judge” learn the science behind the case. It was going to be a boring morning full of numbers and diagrams, he warned the audience.</P><P>But in this polarized moment, a public tussling over the basics of <mark>climate</mark> science, however cursory, is anything but boring. And as each side in the case presented a history of <mark>climate change</mark> science, it was striking just how much the two sides agreed on: <mark>Climate change</mark> is happening, and humans are in large part responsible. But that’s not really what this court case is about. Rather, it’s about who knew what and when, how much uncertainty there is around future predictions and who should be held responsible (and liable) for a future with higher seas and more extreme weather events. That’s where the cities’ and corporations’ use of evidence diverged.</P><P>First up: the scientists.</P><P>At a big rectangular table in the center of the room, the cities were represented by Steve Berman, a lawyer known for his ability to <A href=""https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43qw3j/meet-the-lawyer-trying-to-make-big-oil-pay-for-<mark>climate</mark>-change"">get big settlements out of big corporations</A>, as well as some of their own lawyers. But aside from a few introductory remarks, Berman left the talking to a few of the world’s leading experts on <mark>climate change</mark>. First, he called Myles Allen, who is a professor of geosystem science at Oxford University and was tasked with providing a historiography of <mark>climate change</mark> research.</P><P>In true scientist fashion, the talk was filled with jargon and complicated scientific concepts. Alsup, who made clear that he would call out confusing charts or unclear explanations, asked Allen what made <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, which is emitted from burning fossil fuels and have led to a warming planet, special. Allen, equal to the task, began to pantomime his answer. Arms stretched out to the side, fists in a ball, he shimmied left and right, showing how the charge on a <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide molecule could be unevenly distributed, absorbing the infrared waves that are naturally emitted from Earth, unlike oxygen and nitrogen, whose charge is symmetric. That infrared gets trapped within Earth’s atmosphere, instead of escaping, causing the planet to warm.</P><P>After walking through key figures and research from the last century of <mark>climate</mark> science, Allen concluded by saying that we’ve known that the planet was warming since the 1970s. And crucially, he said, we knew back then that we might not know how bad <mark>climate change</mark> would be, or be able to feel and see the effects of that warming, until it was already too late.</P><P>The next speaker, Gary Griggs, an oceanographer who works at the University of California, Santa Cruz, was deep into an explanation of sea level rise when a loud, piercing alarm went off. “Coastal flood alert,” Alsup quipped as soon as it finished. The room broke out in laughter. It wasn’t clear whether it was real or a drill, but nature has a way of making itself known.</P><P>Next up: the lawyers.</P><P>While the cities relied on scientists, the energy companies relied on lawyers. One in particular: Theodore Boutrous, a lawyer for Chevron (which is headquartered in the Bay Area) did all of the talking. And he got straight to the point, answering the question on everyone’s mind: Yes, Chevron accepts the scientific consensus on <mark>climate change</mark>. And in honor of that consensus, he’d be relying almost entirely on the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, a United Nations-backed consortium meant to provide a scientific view of what <mark>climate change</mark> is doing to the planet, to lay out his understanding of the science and the history.</P><P>He kicked off by quoting from the IPCC’s <A href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/"">most recent report</A>, from 2013, citing population growth and economic changes as the most important drivers of <mark>climate change</mark>. The report, he noted, says nothing about fossil-fuel extraction as a driver of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Boutrous offered a history lesson that had a lot in common with Allen’s, but with a much greater focus on the uncertainty around both the science and the impacts of <mark>climate change</mark> on the Bay Area. He illustrated that uncertainty in various ways, describing how theories that posited alternative roles of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere held sway through at least the 1950s. Boutros also showed how actual temperatures hadn’t been as extreme as many <mark>climate</mark> forecasts predicted in the years leading up to the report. Alsup asked if his point was that the models exaggerated the impact of humans on the <mark>climate</mark>. “Instead of doom and gloom, it’s just gloom?” he asked the lawyer. Boutrous chuckled and moved on.</P><P>Boutrous concluded by showing a map of sea level rise, saying that sea levels had fallen around San Francisco in the years leading up to the 2013 IPCC report. There’s a lot of uncertainty about the future, he concluded, noting that San Francisco and Oakland had reported that <A href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/california-municipalities-debt-disclosures-contrast-with-<mark>climate</mark>-warnings-1515456551"">exact message to bond investors</A> in 2017, when the cities said they couldn’t predict whether major flooding or storms might have a major, adverse impact on the local economy.</P><P>Finally, the tutorial pivoted back to the cities, so it pivoted back to the scientists. Don Wuebbles, who is a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Illinois and co-wrote the 2007 IPCC report that helped the organization win the Nobel Peace Prize, was the final scientist called by the cities. He began by pointing out that he’d also led the writing of the first chapter in the 2013 IPCC report that Boutrous had so carefully recounted. “I think it’s important to recognize that science did not stop; there’s a lot we’ve learned in the last five years,” Wuebbles said. That’s why he’d be using <A href=""https://science2017.globalchange.gov/"">data from the U.S. Global Change Research Program</A>, which produces more frequent, national reports on <mark>climate change</mark> to make his presentation.</P><P>The year after the most recent IPCC report was published was the hottest on record, Wuebbles told the court. Then 2015 topped 2014, and 2016 topped 2015. Temperatures are going up, precipitation is increasing, extreme events are more frequent. Looking at a broader set of years, sea level has risen around the San Francisco Bay. Alsup asked Wuebbles whether he disagreed with Boutrous’s recounting of the science.</P><P>Not really, since the lawyer had based his presentation on the IPCC, and a report that Wuebbles was heavily involved with. But Wuebbles’s point was that the IPCC report doesn’t tell all of what we know in 2018. The IPCC report might not be wrong, but that doesn’t mean that it gives the best picture of what’s right.</P><P>As the tutorial concluded, Alsup had a few final remarks. “I wore my science tie today,” he said, pointing to the solar system hanging around his neck before standing up to leave. “I hope someone takes note of that.”</P></DIV></ARTICLE><DIV class=""mini-bio""><P>Anna Maria Barry-Jester reports on public health, food and culture for FiveThirtyEight.  <SPAN class=""twitter""><A href=""https://twitter.com/annabarryjester"" target=""_blank""><SPAN class=""twitter-username"">@annabarryjester</SPAN></A></SPAN></P></DIV><DIV class=""tags""><P class=""filed-under"">Filed under</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2,1,Negative,,

	Can development organizations be more agile and adaptable in a context of constant change?
</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV>
Constrained by an ageing model of “North-South” assistance and linear thinking, development organizations are finding it increasingly difficult to cope with the complexities and interconnectedness of global challenges, from <mark>climate change</mark> to communicable diseases. However, the convergence of three trends promises a structural change in the way development organizations operate: new ways of framing development problems (complexity theory), new information technologies and new types of coalitions. How can development organizations reform themselves to become more effective at improving the world?<P><STRONG>Development organizations exist to help reduce poverty and inequality, and improve human well-being. These problems are becoming increasingly complex as the world grows more connected and volatile.</STRONG> Cross-border flows of goods, services, people and ideas are expanding. Shocks and crises, whether social, political, economic or environmental, are increasingly frequent. As issues become more interconnected and uncertain, the outcomes of development interventions are harder to predict or explain and it is less possible for one actor alone to get things done.</P><P><STRONG>Despite these changes, the operating model of development organizations is constrained by its legacy.</STRONG> This includes centralized assistance from “developed” country governments to “developing” country governments and practices that largely rely on linear models to understand risk and to plan, execute and evaluate action. </P><P>Can development organizations be more agile and adaptable in today’s context of constant change? The combination of three trends that can help frame, understand and respond to complex problems differently offers an opportunity. </P><P><STRONG>First, complexity theory is shifting attention from linear cause and effect relationships to dynamic processes of change.</STRONG> Complexity theory has been used in physics and ecology to study how systems adapt to their environment and cope with uncertainty. Many development scholars argue that complexity theory can strengthen development organizations’ ability to understand dynamic and interconnected development problems and respond more appropriately.</P><P>In <I>Aid on the Edge of Chaos</I>, Ben Ramalingam shows how this approach can be applied to household food security. Traditionally, most of the work concentrated on predicting the occurrence of a food crisis in order to best respond. Analysing and modelling food systems and the multiple connections between socio-economic and ecological factors that contribute to their stability helped create an understanding of households’ capacity to respond to the negative effects of unpredictable climatic shocks. Analysing these variables, which change over time, can support policies to strengthen household resilience and adapt aid interventions more strategically in crisis situations.</P><P><STRONG>Second, new technologies are opening the door to understanding and anticipating complex development problems through the so-called “data revolution”.</STRONG> New types of data and analytical tools have the potential to provide real-time information on complex situations or sudden change and enable quick feedback loops to inform planning and adjust operations. They can also be used to collect citizens’ voices and feedback and integrate them in programme design. </P><P>For instance, mTrac, a Ugandan platform supported by UNICEF, the World Health Organization and the UK Department for International Development (DFID), surveys local health workers via mobile phone text messaging and then alerts national public health officials about malaria outbreaks and medicine stock situations to anticipate and resolve shortages. The share of health facilities that have run out of malaria treatments has fallen from 80% to 15% since it was introduced. The platform also includes an anonymous text message hotline that citizens can use to report any service delivery problems they face. </P><P><STRONG>Third, new kinds of coalitions and movements are emerging as the multiplication of development actors provides opportunities to redefine partnerships.</STRONG> A growing number of actors operating in the development space, from businesses and municipal governments to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and communities, are starting to figure out how to work together on a voluntary basis to solve specific issues. These coalitions of diverse actors bring information, expertise and funding together in ways that cut across domains, geographies and interests. This can lead to new solutions to old problems, e.g. by presenting development challenges as investment opportunities. </P><P>Examples of such projects already delivering results include the <I>Scaling Up Nutrition </I>(SUN) initiative. SUN brings NGOs, businesses and the UN together to accelerate global efforts on under-nutrition. Organized in a global network, each group of actors supports national efforts to improve nutrition by providing funds and expertise. For actors engaged in the SUN initiative, improving nutrition for women and children is no longer only a moral objective, it is also a way to strengthen the workforce and thus contribute to the growth of markets and nations alike. </P><P>None of these trends are completely new in themselves. But their confluence could transform the operating model of development organizations in ways that include more effective delivery of essential services for the poor; changing engagement with the private sector, from donation providers to partners for supply, investment and solution design; changing engagement with citizens, from intervention recipients to agents of change; enhancing knowledge and data systems co-created by a diversity of actors to inform decision-making; and a growing capacity to tackle multi-dimensional problems and operate effectively in uncertain contexts. </P><P>The opportunities presented by these changes come with challenges, notably, that of changing the culture of development organizations to encourage experimentation and value adaptive strategies. The use of big data raises issues of privacy that could, if mishandled, exacerbate discrimination and inequalities. The growing number of actors, coalitions and movements also raises leadership and coordination challenges, in particular for the intergovernmental decision-making structures created for these purposes.</P><P>However, development organizations exist to solve challenges. Leadership from within to overcome existing political and technical tensions could help mobilize these trends and make development more effective.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1,0,Neutral,,

This Report presents the Consolidated Financial Statements of Shell (pages 137–178), the Parent Company Financial Statements of Shell (pages 199–207) and the Financial Statements of the <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> Dividend Access Trust (pages 213–216). Cross references to Form 20-F are set out on pages 02–03 of this Report.</P><P>Financial reporting terms used in this Report are in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. “Subsidiaries” and “Shell subsidiaries” refer to those entities over which the Company has control, either directly or indirectly. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as “joint ventures” and “joint operations” respectively, and entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as “associates”. “Joint ventures” and “joint operations” are collectively referred to as “joint arrangements”.</P><P>In addition to the term “Shell”, in this Report “we”, “us” and “our” are also used to refer to the Company and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement. The companies in which <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> plc has a direct or indirect interest are separate legal entities. Shell subsidiaries’ data include their interests in joint operations.</P><P>We also refer to “Shell’s net <mark>carbon</mark> footprint” in this Report. This includes Shell’s <mark>carbon</mark> emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers’ <mark>carbon</mark> emissions in supplying energy for that production, and our customers’ <mark>carbon</mark> emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions but, to support society in achieving the Paris Agreement goals, we aim to help and influence such suppliers and consumers to likewise lower theirs. The use of the terminology “Shell’s net <mark>carbon</mark> footprint” is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell or its subsidiaries.</P><P>Except where indicated, the figures shown in the tables in this Report are in respect of subsidiaries only, without deduction of any non-controlling interest. However, the term “Shell share” is used for convenience to refer to the volumes of hydro<mark>carbon</mark>s that are produced, processed or sold through subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. All of a subsidiary’s production, processing or sales volumes (including the share of joint operations) are included in the Shell share, even if Shell owns less than 100% of the subsidiary. In the case of joint ventures and associates, however, Shell-share figures are limited only to Shell’s entitlement. In all cases, royalty payments in kind are deducted from the Shell share.</P><P>The financial statements contained in this Report have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. As applied to the financial statements, there are no material differences from IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB); therefore, the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. IFRS as defined above includes interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee.</P><P>Except where indicated, the figures shown in this Report are stated in US dollars. As used herein all references to “dollars” or “$” are to the US currency.</P><P>This Report contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of Shell.

Daniel Yergin, host of the event and vice chairman of IHS Markit, endlessly put the topic to CEOs and ministers from foreign petro-states.</P><P>It became increasingly clear that days of denial or even skepticism around <mark>climate change</mark> is now out of bounds for executives of publicly traded oil and gas companies.

The overwhelming consensus among scientists, however, is that human activities - namely, the burning of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal - are accelerating global warming.</P><P><EM style=""font-weight: bold;"">No argument</EM></P><P>For many in the oil and gas industry, argument is no longer an option as governments around the world join that consensus. In late 2015, the leaders of nearly 200 countries pledged to dramatically lower <mark>carbon</mark> emissions by 2050 in a pact signed in Paris and known as the Paris agreement.</P><P>As nations tighten <mark>carbon</mark> policies, wind turbines and solar panels have become the fastest growing new source of electricity both in the U.S. and worldwide. That has spurred what amounts to an international arms race on low-<mark>carbon</mark> energy, with China, Europe and the United States battling for supremacy.</P><P>European oil giant <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> is predicting that by 2100, 80 percent of the world's electricity will come from renewables, up from less than 10 percent today.</P><P>&quot;Now that may sound a bit shocking to have an oil company, particularly a big player in the gas business, talk about that,&quot; said Jeff Edwards, general manager of global gas and LNG development for Shell Trading. &quot;But that's just the reality as we see it.&quot;</P><P>Not everyone at CERAWeek was convinced that the age of fossil fuels is coming to an end. Harold Hamm, chief executive of Continental Resources of Oklahoma Cirty and a Trump adviser on energy, said he believed the oil and gas industry was unfairly targeted by <mark>climate change</mark> rules during the Obama administration and suggested that Trump would follow through on his campaign pledge to leave the Paris agreement.</P><P>&quot;We have a unique president today,&quot; Hamm said Wednesday, &quot;unique in that he keeps his promises.&quot;</P><P>Other executives and industry leaders called for investing trillions of dollars in new oil and gas projects to meet a growing demand for energy as developing nations, such as India and China, expand their economies. Chevron CEO John Watson dismissed theories of fast-approaching peak oil demand as &quot;wishful thinking.&quot;</P><P>&quot;You still have literally billions of people entering the middle class,&quot; he said. &quot;It may turn over, but if you look at the forecasts, most of them still show growing liquids consumption for some time.&quot;</P><P>That is true to a certain extent. The International Energy Agency is projecting economic growth in India and China will continue to drive up global crude demand for the next two decades. But by 2040, all bets could be off as renewable energy and electric cars are expected to become ubiquitous features of world societies, analysts said.</P><P>Already, the sharp drop in the price of renewable energy is forcing nuclear and coal-fired power plants to shut down, and slowing the development of new natural gas plants.</P><P>&quot;The trend lines are clearly more wind and more solar and all of that will continue to push fossil off the supply curve,&quot; Barry Smitherman, a board member at NRG Energy and former chairman of the Texas Railroad Commission and Public Utilities Commission, said Thursday.</P><P><EM style=""font-weight: bold;"">Asking for proof</EM></P><P>Investors, meanwhile, are taking note. A growing coalition of pension funds and institutional investors is increasing pressure on oil and gas companies to offer proof of how they will adapt their businesses to prosper in a low-<mark>carbon</mark> economy. Some European firms, including Statoil and the French oil major Total, have already committed to putting defined portions of their capital spending to energy sources that do not produce <mark>carbon</mark>.</P><P>While oil and gas executives might be staying on message, the possibility of a U.S. withdrawal from Paris is causing anxiety among proponents of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Dirk Forrister, president of the trade group International Emissions Trading Association, said he worried if Trump did pull out, some developing countries &quot;might think the pressure's off.&quot;</P><P>But with Europe and China showing no signs of backing away from their Paris commitments, the general belief is the trend toward more <mark>carbon</mark> regulation is not going away.</P><P>&quot;The administration will stir up the pot to some extent,&quot; said Dan Reicher, a law professor at Stanford University who served as an energy adviser to former President Barack Obama. &quot;But I think the basic direction is increasingly being set by forces outside the administration.&quot;</P><P> </P><P><EM style=""font-weight: bold;"">Jordan Blum contributed </EM><EM style=""font-weight: bold;"">to this report.</EM></P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",1,1,Positive,,

It's despised by many conservatives.</P><SECTION class=""ad medium""><P class=""label"">Advertisement</P></SECTION><P>ALEC's Energy, Environment and Agriculture Task Force is slated to vote on a draft <A href=""https://www.alec.org/model-policy/resolution-calling-for-epa-review-of-the-2009-endangerment-finding-for-greenhouse-gases/"">resolution</A> at a meeting in Nashville, Tenn., next month that calls &quot;upon the Environmental Protection Agency to withdraw the 2009 endangerment finding for <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and other greenhouse gases and conduct a new rulemaking on this issue.&quot;</P><P>If ALEC ultimately adopts the resolution, it will serve as a model resolution for state and federal lawmakers to express their disdain for the EPA finding. The vote will put big businesses and trade groups that sit on the ALEC task force on the spot regarding whether the endangerment finding is worth investigating.</P><P>&quot;Robust debate comes from stakeholders engaging from a variety of perspectives. And that is precisely what's happening here,&quot; said ALEC spokesman Bill Meierling. He noted that the draft resolution could be amended or changed when the task force meets in Nashville.</P><P>The tug of war at ALEC mirrors the fight between voices skeptical of mainstream <mark>climate</mark> science — like the nonprofit Heartland Institute — and groups that are more moderate on <mark>climate change</mark>, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</P><P>Heartland is rumored to be behind the endangerment resolution, with former North Dakota state Rep. Bette Grande (R) — who now freelances for Heartland and participates in ALEC matters — thought to have drafted it and handed off the language to a state lawmaker and ALEC member.</P><P>Heartland did not respond to a request for comment.</P><P>Heartland and its allies have pushed EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to take on the endangerment finding, which the EPA chief has been reluctant to pursue. Corporate America, meanwhile, largely supported staying in the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement and retaining the Clean Power Plan — an Obama administration rule to curb power plant emissions — but ultimately lost those battles to far-right groups, though some hope Trump will ultimately remain in the global <mark>climate</mark> pact.</P><H3>Bellwether moment?</H3><P>The endangerment finding vote may serve as a bellwether for where ALEC stands on <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Is ALEC part and parcel of a conservative movement that has questioned <mark>climate change</mark> and the policy responses to it? Or does it operate among the wider atmosphere of reputation-conscious corporations and even some moderates who have opposed the Trump administration on <mark>climate change</mark>?</P><P>But that calculation also belies a more fundamental point about ALEC — while it has a reputation as a far-right group advancing industry interests, it's also a member-driven organization. If ALEC is shifting on <mark>climate</mark> and energy, it's largely because its members have, too.</P><P>&quot;If there were some grand conspiracy, I'd know about it, and there isn't,&quot; said Eli Lehrer, president of the free-market think tank R Street Institute, which supports a <mark>carbon</mark> tax. &quot;To the extent things have changed, it's because opinions have changed.&quot;</P><P>At its core, ALEC is an organization about free markets and limited government. Thus, its members also have railed against and helped craft bills to roll back President Obama's <mark>climate</mark> and environmental measures, many of which were federal regulations, and local incentives for clean energy. At the same time, though, the group has come under fire for taking cash from fossil fuel companies threatened by the advance of clean energy while often neglecting to mention subsidies and incentives that legacy energy sources enjoy.</P><P>Longtime ALEC watchdogs view the endangerment finding draft resolution as an attempt by its conservative members to reorient the organization to its roots after several rudderless years on energy and environment matters. Part of that is a response to the Trump administration, said Nick Surgey, director of Documented, an organization that tracks the influence of corporations on public policy.</P><P>&quot;This is a reflection of an organization that has shifted itself more into the mainstream of <mark>climate change</mark> in terms of rhetoric in the last three to four years,&quot; Surgey said. &quot;Now they've got almost everything they want from Scott Pruitt and the EPA, and they have to justify their existence to their funders. And it seems like they're allying themselves with the more radical of the funders.&quot;</P><P>The cohesion between ALEC and the Trump administration is evident to ALEC CEO Lisa Nelson. She sent a congratulatory email to its members on Jan. 30 to celebrate the new administration, saying, &quot;This administration does have the potential to be an ALEC administration. It is full of the people and ideas we've advanced since 1973.&quot;</P><P>But conservatives familiar with ALEC said they're concerned that the organization has gravitated to satisfying interests that aren't committed to the free-market principles upon which the group was created. They said that dynamic is most apparent in the energy and environment space.</P><P>&quot;When it comes to the policies of the organization, ALEC does have strong positions on issues that are consistent with the free market,&quot; Blair said. &quot;The issue is if they are planning to upend those principles to fundraise in the future.&quot;</P><P>They worry that ALEC is trying to plug a funding gap following the high-profile exits of Google, BP PLC, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> PLC and others, all of which blamed the organization's stance on <mark>climate change</mark> for their departure. Those companies left largely over pressure from shareholders who were spurred into action after activist groups harped on ALEC funding streams. The conservative billionaire industrialist Koch brothers are big donors; Exxon Mobil Corp., a member of the Energy, Environment and Agriculture Task Force, is also a major funder.</P><H3>Conservatives revolt</H3><P>ALEC's conservative members saw warning signs recently when feathers were ruffled over what they said in the past would have been a fairly easy decision.</P><P>The energy task force couldn't agree to move on a resolution that opposed property assessed clean energy, or PACE — a financing mechanism to fund clean energy or energy efficiency upgrades. Conservatives were worried about exposing taxpayers to losses, since municipal bonds underwrote many of the projects.</P><P>But many of ALEC's members also have PACE interests. One conservative source said those groups backing PACE angled to kill the resolution and criticized ALEC for trying to appease such funders. Rockwood Group CEO Scott Zajac, whose investment firm operates in the PACE world, was particularly vocal in opposing the resolution within ALEC, the source said.</P><P>Others, though, noted that's just how the energy space is these days — corporations are on board with clean energy. Rejecting mainstream <mark>climate</mark> science or trying to stymie growth of energy sources that compete with ALEC's old guard of coal, natural gas and oil companies doesn't fly anymore.</P><P>The PACE resolution foundered over much acrimony in ALEC's July meeting and was forbidden to ever return as a discussion point. That result has generated revolt from some of the more dogmatic conservatives.</P><P>&quot;I'm concerned that there has been an effort more recently to try and table what in the past would have been considered straightforward proposals based on free-market principles,&quot; said Tom Pyle, president of the conservative energy think tank Institute for Energy Research. &quot;That's what ALEC is supposed to be advancing.&quot;</P><P>That effort, though, is minor compared with the endangerment finding, which is a lightning rod in <mark>climate policy</mark> circles.</P><P>Publicly traded companies on the Energy, Environment and Agriculture Task Force are getting calls about the upcoming vote on the draft endangerment finding resolution, according to a source familiar with the situation. Companies on that task force include Exxon Mobil, Pfizer Inc. and United Parcel Service Inc.</P><P>&quot;We have not received calls on it to my knowledge, but either way it is not an issue we would support,&quot; UPS spokeswoman Kara Ross said in an email. &quot;As one of the leaders in <mark>sustainable</mark> and transparent logistics, our position on <mark>climate change</mark> is clear.&quot;</P><P>Aside from Exxon Mobil, Pfizer and UPS, the task force also includes lobby group heavyweights such as the Edison Electric Institute, American Fuel &amp; Petrochemical Manufacturers, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association and American Gas Association.</P><P>E&amp;E News contacted all those members. EEI, AGA, AFPM, Pfizer and Exxon Mobil did not respond to requests for comment. NRECA said it didn't want to challenge the endangerment finding because it supports &quot;inside the fence&quot; <mark>carbon</mark> emissions regulations on power plants to replace the Clean Power Plan, which Pruitt formally moved to repeal last month.</P><P>&quot;Challenging the endangerment finding would lead to a different result, which we think would be unwise,&quot; spokesman Dan Riedinger said in an email.</P></SECTION></SECTION></ARTICLE></SECTION></BODY></HTML>",2,1,Positive,,The text is not only about Shell

All of the defendants joined in a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, in which they reiterated arguments from their March 20 motion to dismiss the original complaint: that federal common law claims were either displaced by federal statutes or were “plainly improper”; that the plaintiffs failed to allege the elements of a nuisance claim; and that even if the plaintiffs pleaded a viable claim, judicial resolution would be inappropriate because it would violate separation of powers. Each defendant other than Chevron Corporation also filed a new motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, and <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> plc (Shell) again also sought dismissal on the basis of insufficient service of process. The defendants addressed four questions that the court on March 27 had requested be addressed in the briefing on the motion to dismiss. They said they were aware of no cases sustaining a nuisance theory of liability based on the otherwise lawful sale of a product where the seller finance or sponsored research or advertising intended to cast doubt on studies showing that use of the product was harmful. They also told the court that “no global-warming-based nuisance claim has ever made it past the pleadings,” argued that the plaintiffs sought to hold them liable for speech “plainly immunized” by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, and asserted that the plaintiffs’ “expansive theory of liability has no limiting principle.” The plaintiffs’ response to the motions to dismiss was due by May 3, and defendants’ replies were due by May 10. The court had also set a deadline of May 10 for the United States to submit an amicus brief if it wished to do so. A hearing on the motions to dismiss was scheduled for May 24. </TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/19/2018</TD><TD>Motion to dismiss first amended complaints for lack of personal jurisdiction filed by BP p.l.c.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/18/2018</TD><TD>Motion filed by United States for extension of time to consider whether to participate as amicus curiae.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/18/2018</TD><TD>Order issued setting deadline of May 10, 2018 for United States to file amicus brief.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/04/2018</TD><TD>Redlined first amended complaint filed by plaintiffs (San Francisco).</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/04/2018</TD><TD>Redlined first amended complaint filed by plaintiffs (Oakland).</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>04/04/2018</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2018/20180404_docket-317-cv-06011_order.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Order issued setting schedules for motions to dismiss amended complaint.</TD><TD>The court deemed the March 20 motions to dismiss withdrawn, and new motions to dismiss the amended complaints are due on April 19.

The five named defendants joined in a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. First, they argued that Congress had displaced federal common law claims based on domestic activities, whether those activities involved combustion of fossil fuels (in which case the Clean Air Act displaced federal common law) or production and promotion of fossil fuels (in which case “many federal statutes … expressly regulate (and, in fact, encourage) such conduct)). The defendants also argued that federal common law principles would not support recognition of a claim based on the defendants’ foreign activities. Second, the fossil fuel companies argued that elements of a federal common law claim for public nuisance were absent. The defendants asserted (1) that the plaintiffs had not alleged and could not allege that the defendants’ conduct was unauthorized by law; (2) that it was undisputed that the defendants did not control the fossil fuels at the time of the alleged creation of the nuisance (i.e., the time of combustion); (3) that the complaint’s allegations did not establish causation, since the claims depended “on an attenuated causal chain including billions of intervening third parties—i.e., fossil fuel users like Plaintiffs themselves—and complex environmental phenomena occurring worldwide over many decades”; and (4) that the damages sought by the plaintiffs in the form of an “abatement fund” could not be awarded because plaintiffs had not alleged actual harm, only “speculative future harms that may never eventuate.” The defendants also argued that damages would violate the defendants’ due process and First Amendment rights. Finally, the defendants asserted that judicial relief would violate separation of powers by invading the executive branch’s authority to conduct foreign affairs and legislative authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2018/20180320_docket-317-cv-06011_motion-to-dismiss-1.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction filed by ConocoPhillips Company.</TD><TD>Four of the defendants filed separate motions to dismiss on personal jurisdiction grounds, arguing that the court could not exercise either general jurisdiction over the companies—two of which were non-U.S. companies and two of which were headquartered in Texas and incorporated in other states (one in New Jersey, one in Delaware)—or specific jurisdiction based on the companies’ alleged activities in and contacts with California. <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> plc also asserted that the complaint should be dismissed against it for insufficient service of process.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD>Motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction filed by Exxon Mobil Corporation.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD>Motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction filed by BP p.l.c.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD>Motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, insufficient service of process, and failure to state a claim filed by <mark>Royal Dutch Shell</mark> plc.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD>Response filed by Happer, Koonin, and Lindzen to court's request for information re amicus curiae materials.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD>Responses filed by Viscount Monckton of Brenchley et al. to court's request for information re amicus curiae materials.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD>Plaintiffs filed response to motions to file amicus curiae brief and tutorial presentation and statement of nonopposition.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/20/2018</TD><TD>Stipulation and order issued regarding formatting for briefing of motions to dismiss.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>03/19/2018</TD><TD>Administrative motion for leave to submit presentation in response to the court's tutorial questions filed by William Happer, Steven E.

Connecticut; Requested “Tutorial” on <mark>Climate Change</mark>.</STRONG> The federal district court for the Northern District of California denied Oakland’s and San Francisco’s motions to remand their <mark>climate change</mark> public nuisance lawsuits against five major fossil fuel producers to state court. The court held that federal common law necessarily governed the nuisance claims because “[a] patchwork of fifty different answers to the same fundamental global issue would be unworkable” and “the extent of any judicial relief should be uniform across our nation.” The court stated: “Plaintiffs’ claims for public nuisance, though pled as state-law claims, depend on a global complex of geophysical cause and effect involving all nations of the planet (and the oceans and atmosphere). It necessarily involves the relationships between the United States and all other nations. It demands to be governed by as universal a rule of apportioning responsibility as is available.” The court dispensed with the cities’ three primary arguments for remanding the cases. First, the court said the cities’ novel theories of liability based on the defendants’ sales of their product did not differentiate their claims from earlier transboundary <mark>pollution</mark> suits in which the Supreme Court (American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut) and Ninth Circuit (Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp.) applied federal common law. Second, the court said the Clean Air Act did not displace the plaintiffs’ federal common law claims, allowing state law to govern; the court said that while the Clean Air Act spoke directly to the “domestic emissions” issues presented in American Electric Power and Kivalina, “[h]ere, the Clean Air Act does not provide a sufficient legislative solution to the nuisance alleged to warrant a conclusion that this legislation has occupied the field to the exclusion of federal common law.” Third, the court said the well-pleaded complaint rule did not bar removal. The court also indicated in dicta that “the very instrumentality of plaintiffs’ alleged injury — the flooding of coastal lands — is, by definition, the navigable waters of the United States. Plaintiffs’ claims therefore necessarily implicate an area quintessentially within the province of the federal courts.” The court said defendants had not waived this issue. The court certified the decision for interlocutory appeal, finding that the issue of whether the nuisance claims were removable because such claims are governed by federal common law was a controlling question as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that resolution by the court of appeals would materially advance the litigation. The court’s order also noted that six similar actions brought by other California municipalities were pending before another judge in the district and those actions asserted additional non-nuisance claims. </TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/19/2018</TD><TD>Defendants' reply to plaintiffs' supplemental brief on navigable waters of the United States filed.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/19/2018</TD><TD>Plaintiffs' supplemental reply brief on navigable waters of the United States filed.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/16/2018</TD><TD>Defendants' response to request for supplemental briefing filed.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/16/2018</TD><TD>Plaintiffs' supplemental brief on navigable waters of the United States filed.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>02/12/2018</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2018/20180212_docket-317-cv-06011_request.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Request for supplemental briefing issued.</TD><TD><STRONG>Federal Court in Oakland and California <mark>Climate Change</mark> Suits Against Fossil Fuel Producers Asked for Additional Briefing on Navigable Waters Issue.</STRONG> The federal district court for the Northern District of California considering whether to remand Oakland and San Francisco's <mark>climate change</mark> lawsuits against fossil fuel producers issued a request for supplemental briefing on the issue of how the concept of “navigable waters of the United States” related to removal jurisdiction.

The city attorneys also asserted that none of the other theories in the defendants’ “kitchen-sink notices of removal” had merit: the plaintiffs argued that that their claim to relief did not necessarily raise a substantial and disputed federal issue and also asserted that no court had held that the Clean Air Act completely preempted state common law public nuisance claims.

The plaintiffs also argued that the bankruptcy removal statute did not provide a basis for removal based on the 30-year-old bankruptcy of Texaco, a subsidiary of defendant Chevron Corporation. </TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>11/08/2017</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2017/20171108_docket-317-cv-06011_order-1.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Administrative motion to relate cases denied.</TD><TD><STRONG>California Federal Court Denied Oil and Gas Companies’ Motion to Relate San Francisco and Oakland <mark>Climate</mark> Cases to Other Pending Cases.</STRONG> The Executive Committee for the Northern District of California denied the motion by defendants in <mark>climate change</mark> cases brought by the Oakland and San Francisco city attorneys to relate those two cases to the pending cases brought by San Mateo and Marin Counties and the City of Imperial Beach.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>11/06/2017</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2017/20171106_docket-317-cv-06011_na.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Statement regarding administrative motion to relate cases filed by San Mateo and Marin Counties and City of Imperial Beach.</TD><TD>San Mateo and Marin Counties and the City of Imperial Beach took no position on the defendants' administrative motion to relate their cases to the cases brought by Oakland and San Francisco.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>11/03/2017</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2017/20171103_docket-317-cv-06011_opposition-1.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Joint response filed by Oakland and San Francisco in opposition to administrative motion to relate cases.</TD><TD>San Francisco and Oakland opposed relating the cases to the cases brought by San Mateo and Marin Counties and the City of Imperial Beach.</TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>11/02/2017</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2017/20171102_docket-317-cv-06011_motion-1.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Administrative motion filed by defendants to relate cases.</TD><TD>The defendants moved to relate Oakland's and San Francisco's cases to the lawsuits brought by San Mateo and Marin Counties and the City of Imperial Beach. </TD></TR><TR class=""""><TD>10/20/2017</TD><TD class=""file-download""><A target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/<mark>climate</mark>-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2017/20171020_docket-317-cv-06011_notice-1.pdf"">Download</A></TD><TD>Notice of removal filed by defendants.</TD><TD><STRONG>Oil and Gas Companies Removed San Francisco and Oakland <mark>Climate</mark> Cases to Federal Court.</STRONG> On October 20, 2017, the five oil and gas company defendants in the City of San Francisco’s and City of Oakland’s <mark>climate change</mark> nuisance lawsuits removed the cases to federal court.

Attracting manufacturers such as Audi, Jaguar, Mahindra, Renault and, from the 2019-20 season, Mercedes and Porsche, the electric single-seater series is in a position of enviably rude health.</P><P>The <A href=""/node/225290"" target=""_blank"">addition of electronics giant <mark>ABB</mark> as a title sponsor in a multi-year deal</A>, however, is potentially the biggest coup so far, with some suggesting an annual fee of around $15 million finding its way into the coffers.</P><P>It flies in the face of the current motor sport <mark>climate</mark>, one in which Santander has pulled its $40 million annual sponsorship of Formula 1 and Ferrari to enter the Champions League in 2018; McLaren enters another new season lacking a major sponsor; NASCAR continues to wrestle with Monster Energy to renew its contract and IndyCar has lost the support of Verizon.</P><P>By bringing on board a title sponsor that earns nearly $34 billion of revenue per year, Formula E has seemingly bucked the trend. Significantly, it could now turn a profit for the first time.</P><P>The results of the partnership, a week after FE made its announcement in London, were instantly clear at Marrakesh, with towering banners sporting the electronic giant’s name lining the circuit for its first round as sponsor.</P><P>But it wasn’t immediately clear why billboards sporting the <mark>ABB</mark> logo were there, or who <mark>ABB</mark> was. Even the company’s executives admitted that the giant suffers from a lack of identity when it comes to consumers.</P><P>“In the past, I think we were too humble as an engineering company to portray what we were contributing, which needs to change,” said Nicolas Ziegler, the head of global brand management, to a reporter from The Drum.</P><P>The trouble with longstanding energy infrastructure corporations is that they don’t have an obvious tangible product for spectators to engage with. <mark>ABB</mark> has been working behind the scenes since 1883, for example, and still anonymous to the wider world.</P><P>Those at <mark>ABB</mark> are adamant that Formula E will help the company shed its clinical image, as CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer’s impassioned speech stated: “Together, we will write the next phase of this exciting sports activity and foster high-performance teams,” he said.</P><P>“Together, we will write the future – one electrifying race at a time.”</P><P>Back at Marrakesh, <mark>ABB</mark>’s intentions were set out much more gently. A mock electronic charging station stood next to a model of its new fully electric ‘flash-charging bus’ –complete with battery changing robotic arm, which drops in a fully charged power supply from stop-to-stop.</P><P>The company also produces electric car chargers – more than 5000 are present in 56 countries around the world, with a growing business in charging networks. It should be noted that electric mobility isn’t <mark>ABB</mark>’s priority, but it’s an evolving part of a colossal firm that primarily focuses on producing the backbone behind electric grids, world over.</P><P>Those products alone make the reasoning behind its sponsorship of FE much clearer, and series founder and <A href=""https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/opinion/formula-e/formula-e-will-be-only-motor-sport"" target=""_blank"">CEO Alejandro Agag’s bullishness over the series’ staying power</A> seems to match comfortably with the tone of Spiesshofer.</P><P>Even more fitting is the fact that Morocco, which hosted the first FE round under <mark>ABB</mark> sponsorship (and the second of 2017-18), produces the fewest <mark>carbon</mark> emissions per capita out of any location in the calendar, with Chile, Mexico and Uruguay all relatively low CO<SUB>2</SUB> emitters. </P><P>Switzerland lifted its ban on motor racing for the first time in more than six decades to welcome Formula E in 2017, and it derives nearly 60 per cent of its energy from renewable sources.</P><H3>Related: <A href=""https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/september-1954/32/grosser-preis-der-schweiz"" target=""_blank"">Grosser Preis der Schweiz</A></H3><P>It is puzzling, then, as to why the United States is hosting the penultimate (or final, depending on whether FE secures a double-header on July 28-29) round after the electric grid hits Zurich on June 10.</P><P>The country is a thorn in the side of attempts to fight against <mark>climate change</mark>, with a lack of drive to reduce CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions and no signs of its leadership tearing the country away from its lucrative stash of fossil fuels; the round in New York seems an ill-fitting way to end the season.</P><P>It’s not just the USA. The presence of Hong Kong on the calendar, which sources a negligible proportion of its energy from renewable sources and has a continuing thirst for coal, should place the series at a crossroads.</P><P>A Birmingham round has been touted to be FE’s season-ender but, with a sponsor pushing its own green credentials and a series that urges a <mark>sustainable</mark> low-emission motor sport, perhaps there are more fitting locations than the United Kingdom to host the final two races of the 2017/18 series.</P><P>The CEO of <mark>ABB</mark> also questioned the UK’s motivation to increase the capacity of its charging network at the Formula E announcement in London: “The UK has a big population that really wants to contribute to a greener, more <mark>sustainable</mark> world,” said Spiesshofer.</P><P>“But there’s always a question of whether it’s quick enough. In the next couple of years, it’s in the interest of everybody to make sure the infrastructure is coming up.”</P><P>While the series will face questions over the lack of noise, the quality of racing and the choice of circuits, its barometer of success rests on whether FE’s environmentally friendly mission with <mark>ABB</mark> contains lasting substance. Or whether it will disappear under a smoky cloud.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id=""block-views-related-content-block"" class=""block block-views""><H3>Related &amp; recent</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2,2,Positive,,

The fact that energy efficiency is the thread that runs through all of <mark>ABB</mark>’s planning makes the company a strong fighter against <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>“Our crown jewels in this are our frequency converters, which were developed in Vaasa and which reduced <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions by about 340 million tonnes in 2014 worldwide. The energy they saved corresponds to the consumption of 110 million residences,” says Juha Muhonen, <mark>ABB</mark> Finland’s Sales Director in Rail and Wind.</P><DIV id=""attachment_189"" style=""max-width: 279px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">“With their energy efficiency and innovative solutions for utilising renewable energy sources, <mark>ABB</mark>’s technologies support the building of a <mark>sustainable</mark> world,” Juha Muhonen says.</P></DIV><P><mark>ABB</mark>’s technologies support energy production that is based on renewable energy sources, which the EU aims to increase to 50% by 2050. Already wind, biomass, solar and hydropower are growing rapidly and replacing coal more and more. Energy is mainly still produced in large units, and the cash flow runs from the consumer to the producer. However, decentralised energy production will change this pattern: when a lot of the energy in a network is supplied by small producers, both energy and cash flows will run in both directions.
“<mark>ABB</mark> has a great solution for this and it is smart grids. Fluctuating demand requires smart electric current to ensure a stable energy supply,” Muhonen explains.</P><P><mark>ABB</mark> is currently developing solutions for storing the extra electricity obtained from renewable energy sources; it is working on electric banks of accumulators for various needs. It has made the most progress with charging devices for electric cars and buses.
“For marine use, we have a hybrid ship in the pipeline that could carry batteries along at sea. The ship would be charged with shore-side electricity in the port, which would reduce its noise <mark>pollution</mark> and emissions,” says Muhonen.</P><P>In Finland, for example, one fifth of all the energy consumed is expended by transport of all kinds. Fortunately, <mark>ABB</mark>’s solutions can help to make transport more environmentally friendly.
“<mark>ABB</mark>’s Azipod® electric propulsion and energy management system, for example, reduces a vessel’s energy consumption by up to 20% and cuts <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions significantly,” Muhonen says. The energy consumption of trains can also be cut by up to 30% when their braking energy is converted into electricity to be utilised by the train.</P><DIV id=""attachment_190"" style=""max-width: 451px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><P class=""wp-caption-text"">Energy efficiency is the thread that runs through all of <mark>ABB</mark> planning. It makes the company a strong fighter against <mark>climate change</mark>.</P></DIV><P>Muhonen believes that it is possible to replace practically all the internal combustion engines in the world with electric motors. The consumption of electricity by industrial electric motors worldwide, currently 28%, could also be reduced significantly. Furthermore, there is enough renewable energy available to be utilised multifold, if increasing its use was not so slow. In Muhonen’s view, the crucial point is the development of battery technology, which will further advance a <mark>sustainable</mark> world.

      city of Davos and <mark>ABB</mark> have teamed up in a long-term partnership to 
      provide e-infrastructure for public and private transportation.
    </P><P>
      Davos residents and WEF guests can experience the pioneering TOSA bus 
      for themselves. The award-winning TOSA bus, developed by <mark>ABB</mark> in 
      Switzerland, is already in use in Geneva and will soon be implemented in 
      the French city of Nantes. It can recharge its battery in just 20 
      seconds as passengers board and disembark. In Davos, it will operate on 
      the busy Line 1, running from the tourist center to the hospital. This 
      is the first time TOSA technology is being used in an Alpine region. The 
      idea is to run the system under extreme winter weather conditions; <mark>ABB</mark> 
      and its project partners expect to gain valuable insights from this 
      pilot project.
    </P><P>
      In addition, electric cars transporting attendees around Davos will be 
      able to recharge their batteries at eight newly installed <mark>ABB</mark> 
      fast-charging stations.
    </P><P>
      Collectively, the TOSA e-bus and the charging stations provide a 
      powerful, real-world demonstration of state-of-the-art <mark>sustainable</mark> 
      transportation technologies, which are seeing increased deployment 
      throughout the world as e-mobility becomes the driving force for 
      bringing energy efficiency with low environmental impact to cars, buses, 
      trains, ships and cable cars.
    </P><P>
      “The shift to electric vehicles is no longer a question of if, but 
      rather of when and how quickly,” said <mark>ABB</mark> CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer. “EVs 
      are becoming increasingly attractive to motorists. As well as being 
      ecologically responsible, they're becoming less expensive to buy and 
      maintain.”
    </P><P>
      <mark>ABB</mark> is the technology leader in the fast-charging products and systems 
      that are transforming transportation in globally <mark>sustainable</mark> ways. 
      <mark>Sustainable</mark> transportation is playing a crucial role in the fight 
      against <mark>climate change</mark>, as e-mobility begins to replace 
      fossil-fuel-powered vehicles spewing greenhouse gases contributing to 
      global warming.
    </P><P><B>Fast-charging at the World Economic Forum meeting</B></P><P>
      For e-cars, <mark>ABB</mark> is already the global leader in fast charging, with more 
      than 6,000 stations installed in more than 50 countries. At Davos, world 
      leaders will get to see the eight recently installed <mark>ABB</mark> Terra 53 
      charging stations in action. The <mark>ABB</mark> Terra 53 is the best-selling 50 kW 
      DC charging station in Europe and North America, supporting the CCS, 
      CHAdeMO and simultaneous 43 kW AC charging standards.
    </P><P>
      For public transport, the all-electric TOSA e-bus at Davos is at the 
      cutting edge of <mark>sustainable</mark> transportation <mark>innovation</mark>. Indeed, TOSA 
      received the prestigious Watt d’Or 2018 in the energy efficient mobility 
      category from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy. The TOSA technology 
      was jointly developed in Switzerland by <mark>ABB</mark> in partnership with 
      Transport Publics Genevois (tpg), the Office de Promotion of Industries 
      et des Technologies (OPI), the Services Industriels de Genève (SIG), and 
      bus manufacturer Carrosserie HESS.
    </P><P>
      The same TOSA technology in use at Davos has been powering buses on 
      Geneva's bus line 23 airport route. They use overhead contacts that 
      connect at selected stops along their routes to replenish their 
      batteries in as little as 20 seconds, recharging as passengers board and 
      exit. The environmentally friendly system in Geneva could ultimately cut 
      <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions by 1,000 tons annually.
    </P><P>
      But <mark>ABB</mark>’s <mark>sustainable</mark> transportation solutions aren't limited to 
      conventional cars and buses.
    </P><P>
      <mark>ABB</mark> supplies the railway sector with innovative and energy-efficient 
      technologies like traction transformer and converter made primarily in 
      Switzerland. One example is the Rhaetian Railway that shuttles between 
      Landquart and Davos.
    </P><P>
      In the racing world, through its recently announced partnership with the 
      Formula E electric-car racing organization, <mark>ABB</mark> will help to refine the 
      design and functionality of electric vehicles and infrastructure as well 
      as associated digital platforms.
    </P><P>
      <mark>ABB</mark> is also enabling e-mobility in ocean-going tankers, freighters and 
      passenger ships. There, <mark>ABB</mark>’s <A target=""_blank"" href=""http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fnew.<mark>abb</mark>.com%2Fmarine%2Fsystems-and-solutions%2Felectric-propulsion%2Fazipod&amp;esheet=51746724&amp;newsitemid=20180122006126&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Azipod&amp;index=1&amp;md5=91ef11b58ad0e903731583e9b679b482"" rel=""nofollow"">Azipod</A> 
      propulsion systems power vessels with steerable, high-efficiency 
      electric-drive propellers, which make ships significantly more 
      maneuverable and can reduce their need for on-board fossil fuels by 40 
      percent or more.
    </P><P>
      <mark>ABB</mark> is also taking e-mobility to new heights in cable cars. <mark>ABB</mark> motors 
      power the steepest funicular cable railway in the world, which opened in 
      the Swiss Alpine village of Stoos in December 2017. The <mark>ABB</mark> motors, 
      which deliver a total output of 2.3 megawatts, enable the cable railway 
      to carry up to 1,500 people per hour in each direction over its 1.7 
      kilometer route. <mark>ABB</mark> has also provided state-of-the-art motors and 
      drives for a newly opened, record-setting gondola system carrying 580 
      passengers an hour to the Zugspitze — Germany's highest peak.

Today, we are the world leader in microgrids technology. Our main goal is to integrate more renewables into grids across the globe, thus being a main actor in driving the energy transition forward. We are continually working on lowering the <mark>carbon</mark> intensity across all our services and all our current implementations of the microgrid technology save fossil fuels every day.</P><P name=""bffc"" id=""bffc"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">Why are microgrids of crucial importance?</STRONG></P><P name=""1785"" id=""1785"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">We’re currently witnessing a global trend in full swing, which is the rapid growth of renewables. This trend is driven by price reductions and the more decentralised nature of renewables. In both mature and emerging markets, renewables have taken leadership for the investment in power generation. The microgrid technology is the natural development to keep this trend growing, and to integrate more renewables into our power supply on and off grid. Renewables also have a different interaction with the grid and the consumer; this interaction needs to be managed as intelligently as possible, which modern microgrids do while improving system reliability.</P><P name=""1afc"" id=""1afc"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">What are the main advantages of microgrids?</STRONG></P><P name=""ca76"" id=""ca76"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Microgrids are like smaller versions of the national electricity grid running independently. They are a complement to the centralised transmission grid system, which has quite a lot of drawbacks (energy loss, high investment cost, disturbances for users, etc.). The microgrid technology address all these issues, especially for communities and regions that have adequate renewable energy resources.</P><P name=""63ba"" id=""63ba"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Microgrids also have much smaller financial commitments, they use renewable energy resources, hence are more environmentally friendly with lower <mark>carbon</mark> footprints; they are also isolated from any grid disturbance or outage and require fewer technical skills (as large scale power plants) to operate as they rely more on automation.</P><P name=""30f2"" id=""30f2"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Microgrids thus enhance the grid resilience and stability and contribute to the energy security by controlling its distributed energy resources. Operating in either grid-connected or islanded mode, microgrids have the ability to integrate and dispatch these resources, which include renewable generation, fossil fuel generation and storage, and finally manage loads.</P></DIV><DIV class=""section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn""><P name=""fc55"" id=""fc55"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--figure""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">On the other side, what would you say are the biggest challenges facing the uptake of microgrids worldwide?</STRONG></P><P name=""1b5d"" id=""1b5d"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">What’s not a problem is the technology. Indeed, it has been here for many years, and has now reached a mature status. Our main challenge today is to convince customers and stakeholders to accept new roles and responsibilities. In every area of business, it is always a challenge to adapt traditional commercial and technical concepts, but this is also what makes this work interesting. We’re pioneers.</P><P name=""3df1"" id=""3df1"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">With the integration of microgrids, existing players that have always had central power lose some of that control. There is a shift in responsibilities. A large energy customer can, for instance, implement his own microgrid and produce a lot of his energy, instead of buying it from his utility. But what happens when this customer doesn’t want to maintain his microgrid? Could the utility provider make new revenue by maintaining the microgrid, and providing high-quality grid stability? These questions are still unanswered, although we are already seeing the emergence of multiple business models, which is exciting.</P><P name=""1017"" id=""1017"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">As for any new technology, we must create trust in the concept. As described, microgrids go along with a shift in responsibilities and loss of centralised control. Not all influential stakeholders in the electricity system are happy with that shift. And regulators responsible for system stability need to be further convinced that decentralised power generation will guarantee and even improve grid stability. Let’s not forget that with any change, always comes resistance.</P><P name=""19bf"" id=""19bf"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">How are microgrid revolutionizing the energy structure in emerging countries?</STRONG></P><P name=""35ff"" id=""35ff"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">In an emerging market with growing population and electricity demand, microgrids provide reliable power supply, starting from small energy systems and finally supporting the bulk of the electric system. The implementation time of microgrids is much faster and cheaper than fossil fuel based power plants and large infrastructure. To give you a rough idea, it takes around six months to get a microgrid generating electricity online and a realistic timeframe for coal plants is between 5 to 10 years.</P><P name=""d88b"" id=""d88b"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Microgrids are best known for delivering electricity to communities or industrial operations in remote or inaccessible areas where it is too costly or difficult to provide a grid connection. However, grid-connected microgrids are now taking on a new role in developed areas of the world to ensure continuity of supply in the event of potential grid faults and emergencies. The ability of microgrids to seamlessly separate and isolate themselves from the main grid when needed is an increasingly important feature.</P><P name=""18fe"" id=""18fe"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">As a disruptive invention, have you ever faced any resistance from mainstream grid suppliers and governments when it comes to introducing microgrids to markets across the globe?</STRONG></P><P name=""63dc"" id=""63dc"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">We had in the past, but it is becoming better. Years ago, grid suppliers and utilities were hesitant because the magnitude of implementation of renewables and batteries were not so clear. Today, distribution system operators are a lot more open to the concept of microgrids. They are responsible for providing grid stability, and they face a lot of integration of renewable energy — starting from house — holds up to utility scale projects — so they are familiar with the realities of a changing grid.</P><P name=""d283"" id=""d283"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">In fact, whoever is responsible for the system stability has now started to see distributed generation and microgrids as a reliable option.</P><P name=""9c59"" id=""9c59"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">Tell us about <mark>ABB</mark> successes in transforming the energy systems abroad?</STRONG></P><P name=""b2c0"" id=""b2c0"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">We have over 40 references globally with a wide spread of applications, from industry applications to powering harbours. Let me give you a few examples. As far as industrial applications are concerned, we have delivered a microgrid to support a factory in South Africa with handling of critical loads that also stabilises the grid connection, integrating renewable energy and batteries. This has reduced the downtime of the factory as well as the usage of diesel generation, resulting in a lot of savings for the customer. We are currently commissioning a similar project for the Red Cross to support their logistic centre in Tanzania.</P><P name=""1335"" id=""1335"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Another recent project we have done was to build several microgrid solutions that ensure high penetration of photovoltaics into the energy systems of mines in very off-grid locations. Those microgrids ensure grid stability and cost reduction from less usage fossil fuels.</P><P name=""b314"" id=""b314"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">In Aruba and Kodiak Island (Alaska), we have delivered solutions to increase the penetration of renewables and reduce the high cost of diesel for the local community.

That’s when <mark>BASF</mark> stepped in and decided to be part of the solution.</P><P>“Due to a perception that habitat loss was responsible for declining populations, we felt it was important to determine how the agricultural community could develop additional habitat in non-crop areas,” said Burleson Smith, Regulatory Affairs Manager, <mark>BASF</mark>, who’s been involved in this project from the start.</P><P><mark>BASF</mark> launched a biodiversity research initiative called<A class=""externalLink"" href=""http://agro.<mark>basf</mark>.us/living-acres/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> Living Acres</A> two years ago in Holly Springs, N.C., in hope of increasing the monarchs’ population by<A class=""externalLink"" href=""https://www.usgs.gov/news/more-milkweeds-located-throughout-landscape-can-help-conserve-monarchs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> planting milkweed</A> in non-crop areas, such as ditches, roadsides, alleyways and border areas. The objective was to provide information to farmers about planting milkweed in non-crop areas in an economic and practical manner. <mark>BASF</mark> followed up this effort by spreading the word on social media this year and launching the<A class=""externalLink"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/<mark>BASF</mark>.LivingAcres/app/?sk=app_234658916574732"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> Monarch Challenge</A> on Facebook, encouraging farmers to sign up to receive a free milkweed starter kit and grow the plants to increase biodiversity. More than 1300 farm families signed up, exceeding <mark>BASF</mark>’s 500 goal for the year. <mark>BASF</mark> sent out 500 milkweed starter kits, consisting of 18 milkweed seedlings, which totaled 9,000 milkweed seedlings this year.</P><P>Aside from being a monarch larvae’s sole food, milkweed is also slightly toxic to most animals and insects, save for the monarchs, who metabolize it and incorporate it into their bodies, which protects them from danger. Research efforts have shown much better long-term success when milkweed plots were started with seedlings or root cuttings rather than seeds, according to Laura Vance, Living Acres Biology Representative, <mark>BASF</mark>.</P><P>As <mark>BASF</mark>’s initiative continues to gain more traction and corporations, such as agricultural company<A class=""externalLink"" href=""http://www.chsinc.com/our-company/news-and-media/news/2017/05/01/chs-inc-accepts-the-<mark>basf</mark>-monarch-challenge"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> CHS</A>, and universities started getting involved, the chemical company decided to go the extra mile and extend the Monarch Challenge to professional and specialty solutions businesses, such as turf grass customers. In June, the challenge included its first golf course—North Carolina State University’s Lonnie Poole. Volunteers from the college and <mark>BASF</mark>’s crop protection division in Raleigh collaborated to plant a variety of milkweed plants.</P><P>According to Moore,</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“Golf courses have ample opportunity to create quality habitat for pollinators and monarchs.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>“They cover large amounts of area and they already have the capacity to maintain their ground, so approaching them about small changes, like adding milkweed and nectar plants is not an issue.”</P><P>About 750 milkweed plants and wildflowers were planted in low-impact areas of the golf course in hopes of establishing monarch habitat.</P><P><mark>BASF</mark>’s goal with this initiative is to show how modern agriculture can coexist with refuges for monarchs and play an important role in promoting biodiversity of wildlife future generations.</P><P>“Now when I look at a garden, I see it totally different than I did before,” Vance added. “I look at which insects are on which flower, and then where are they going.

Findings from those discussions were recently published in the whitepaper “<A href=""https://creator-space.<mark>basf</mark>.com/content/<mark>basf</mark>/creatorspace/en/celebrating-150/white_papers/new-york-whitepaper.html"" target=""_blank"">Co-creating solutions for urban neighborhoods in coastal cities</A>.&quot;</EM></P><P>Coastal cities are on the front lines of <mark>climate change</mark> impacts. Cities such as New York are increasingly being affected by devastating storms and events that threaten natural resources, infrastructure and communities. A greater understanding of where and how communities are vulnerable to loss from coastal hazards is leading to the adoption of planning and development practices that help dictate the ability to bounce back and limit the amount of loss after damaging storms and events.  </P><P>In an effort to address some of these issues, <mark>BASF</mark> held a Creator Space<SPAN> New York City</SPAN> tour in May 2015. The aim was create strategies to improve urban living in coastal areas, using the Red Hook area of Brooklyn, N.Y. to serve as a model for other communities recovering from disasters. A diverse collection of industry experts, including members of USGBC, local residents and academics converged during two key Creator Space events, the Summit on Urban Living and the Creator Space Design Competition.</P><P>The events focused on three broad areas: habitat, citizenship and resilience, all aimed at improving the quality of life in Red Hook.</P><P>Ideas generated from the summit are captured in the white paper<SPAN>,</SPAN> which contains actionable recommendations for both rebuilding the community and increasing the resilience of infrastructure and buildings in the event of rising sea levels. Three ideas, featured below, represent ways to further resiliency and sustainability for coastal cities around the globe. Although these ideas could work in isolation, their impact is exponential when deployed holistically.</P><P><STRONG>Establish a network of green corridors:</STRONG> In addition to enhancing circulation and absorbing or channeling runoff from rainstorms to increase flood resilience, re-landscaping required to create green corridors would also improve social cohesion and reduce Red Hook’s isolation through shared spaces for pedestrians, as well as allowing for increased community interaction.</P><P><STRONG>Create a coastal park</STRONG>: To work in harmony with an ever-changing environment, a coastal park would serve not only as a first line of defense from storm surges and rising sea levels, but would also double as protection and recreational space for Red Hook’s residents. A second line of protection farther from the shoreline, consisting of breakwaters, dikes and ponds, would help absorb storm surges.</P><P><STRONG>Inspire with a model block:</STRONG> The concept behind the model block could demonstrate how smart design, the latest technology from <mark>BASF</mark>, can affordably preserve the character of a neighborhood and contribute to its resiliency and sustainability. Additionally, it serves to demonstrate a framework for <mark>sustainable</mark> and efficient living and working in an urban environment.</P><P> </P><P>Since the summit, <mark>BASF</mark> is continuing the dialogue among multiple stakeholders to share the solutions developed from the summit in an effort to help other coastal communities benefit from the research and findings. We are also exploring opportunities with private development partners, government advocates and NGOs with local interests that recognize the value of investing in a more resilient Red Hook. We see community engagement as paramount to the success of this effort and are establishing strong relationships with local residents, neighborhood businesses and key stakeholders to address consequences of <mark>climate change</mark> on the environment.</P><P>We are feeling the impact of <mark>climate change</mark> across the globe.

These include for example workers, union health and safety representatives, industrial hygienists, nurses, community health experts, and social scientists. It also includes tribal representatives, environmental justice representatives, and spokespersons for susceptible populations. Such experts bring a field expertise that is tremendously valuable to ground-truth EPA policies and practices.</P><P>There are some great candidates on EPA’s list—solid scientists that believe in an EPA where the “E” and “P” really matter.

Exponent has a portion of its practice dedicated to “<A href=""https://www.exponent.com/services/practices/environmental-sciences/chemical-regulation--food-safety/?serviceId=0546eed8-a627-4fed-b360-0de396c65f96&amp;loadAllByPageSize=true&amp;knowledgePageSize=3&amp;knowledgePageNum=0&amp;newseventPageSize=3&amp;newseventPageNum=0"">Chemical Regulation</A> and Food Safety” where it promises its clients, “high-quality, creative, and practical solutions to problems that affect our clients' ability to conduct business globally”, including access to its staff of “technical and regulatory consultants”.

In a 2015 report co-authored by Honeycutt titled, “Lowering the Ozone Standard Will Not Measurably Improve Public health,” the authors write, “The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality argues that the thoughtful integration of scientific data does not support the assumption that tightening the <A href=""https://energyindepth.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Shaw-Lange-and-Honeycutt-EM-2015-Ozone-Health-Benefits.pdf"">ozone standard</A> will result in measurable health benefits.”  Honeycutt has repeatedly made public statements and testified in Congress to <A href=""https://science.house.gov/sites/republicans.science.house.gov/files/documents/hearings/HHRG-112-%20SY20-WState-MHoneycutt-20120606.pdf"">dispute the harmfulness of smog</A> (ground-level ozone) and soot (PM2.5) air <mark>pollution</mark>.

In addition to a long <A href=""https://www.corp-research.org/exxonmobil"">rap sheet</A> of environmental regulatory and criminal violations, in 2015 Exxon was shown to have <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/content/Exxon-The-Road-Not-Taken"">intentionally misled</A> investors and the public about the financial risks of <mark>climate change</mark>, while funding <mark>climate</mark>-deniers and fighting <mark>climate</mark>-related legislation despite evidence in their own corporate documents acknowledging the real dangers of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P><STRONG>Kimberly White </STRONG>- Employed by the American Chemistry Council (ACC), the trade organization for the chemical manufacturing companies including ExxonMobil. The ACC and its member companies have a direct and very substantial financial interest weakening or destroying EPA policies and regulations that would safeguard human health and the environment from toxic industrial products and <mark>pollution</mark>.  For example, <A href=""https://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/2dd7f669225439b78525735900400c31/59847b4dd6dced8385257db30001b42e!OpenDocument"">EPA enforcement actions</A> in 2014 targeted Shell and DuPont – both ACC members -  for dangerous air toxics released during industrial flaring at their refineries and chemical plants; this was noted to be particularly harmful to the health of minority and low-income communities living nearby.

D'Aleo said his priority on the board would be attacking the endangerment finding, the legally binding document that holds that <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide and other greenhouse gases harm human health and must be regulated by the executive branch. He said he wants to challenge the finding because it could otherwise be used later to build back Obama-era environmental regulations. &quot;We're going to push for reconsideration, start from scratch and put together the best science,&quot; he said. &quot;If <mark>CO2</mark> is not a serious pollutant, let's focus the attention of the EPA on other issues.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Edwin Berry</STRONG> funded his own <mark>climate</mark> research and says human <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions do not cause <mark>climate change</mark>. He has compared those who believe in human-caused <mark>climate change</mark> to &quot;Aztecs who believed they could make rain by cutting out beating hearts and rolling decapitated heads down temple steps.&quot; On his Twitter account, he has called Islam &quot;a death cult&quot; and has encouraged motorists to drive into protesters. Berry, in an email to E&amp;E News, described his tweet as a joke and said he does not advocate violence…. Berry, who confirmed that he and a number of other skeptics were nominated by Heartland, said he wants to use his position on the board to show that humans barely contribute to atmospheric <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide levels, which he claimed are mostly driven by natural factors. &quot;Let's get over this whole thing about <mark>climate change</mark> being an important thing, because in fact we humans have a negligible impact on <mark>climate</mark>,&quot; he said.</P><P><STRONG>Alan Carlin</STRONG>, a retired EPA employee who is affiliated with Heartland fought the agency's crafting of the endangerment finding. Carlin, an economist, was at the center of a political firestorm under Obama after he produced a widely criticized 93-page report comprising cherry-picked scientific data and blog entries concluding that regulating <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide was &quot;the worst mistake that EPA has ever made.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Kevin Dayaratna</STRONG>, a statistician at the conservative Heritage Foundation: His report was cited by Trump as a reason to withdraw from the Paris <mark>climate</mark> accord. It claimed that the agreement could shrink U.S. gross domestic product by $2.5 trillion within two decades (though Trump stated the impact as coming within a decade). The report was criticized by some as being misleading, because that amount is less than 1 percent of the aggregate GDP over that period and the report did not account for the cost of taking no <mark>climate change</mark> action. Dayaratna was invited to attend Trump's withdrawal announcement in June in the White House Rose Garden.</P><P><STRONG>Paul Driessen</STRONG>, a senior policy adviser at the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, a libertarian environmental think tank: His organization handed out leaflets at a <mark>climate</mark> protest this year in Washington, D.C., that said, &quot;<mark>CO2</mark> is not the 'control knob' of the <mark>climate</mark>.&quot; He also co-founded <mark>Climate</mark> Exit, or &quot;Clexit,&quot; which criticized the science behind the Paris <mark>climate</mark> agreement and holds that spiking levels of atmospheric <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide benefit the Earth. &quot;The world must abandon this suicidal Global Warming crusade,&quot; the group stated in its founding statement. &quot;Man does not and cannot control the <mark>climate</mark>.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>Gordon Fulks</STRONG>, a physicist and adviser to the Cascade Policy Institute, an Oregon-based libertarian think tank: He has denied that net sea ice melt is occurring and that the Earth is warming.

Hopes are fading that the European Commission can match “nice words” with action, EURACTIV was told.</P><P>The EU’s 28 industry ministers gathered in Brussels on 20 February for a meeting of the Competitiveness Council which discussed a European Commission policy paper (<A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/4108/attachments/1/translations/en/renditions/native"">communication</A>) for an “industrial renaissance”, published earlier in January.</P><P>“As you know, for Europe, energy prices are a big problem,” said Antonio Tajani, the Italian commissioner in charge of enterprise and industry behind the <A href=""http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-42_en.htm"">industrial renaissance</A> initiative.</P><P>Speaking to the press after the meeting, Tajani said: “The first action by the European Commission is to put on the table for the first time the money for European re-industrialisation – one hundred billion euros coming from regional funds.” Other funds available for re-industrialisation include the €40 billion available for <mark>innovation</mark> and scientific research under the <A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/"">Horizon 2020</A> programme, which runs until the end of the decade.</P><P>“First of all, we aim to address the high cost of energy and the lack of a unified energy market. I believe that this is probably the most important priority,” added Kostis Hatzidakis, the Greek minister for development and competitiveness who was chairing the ministerial meeting.</P><P>“We need to mitigate the negative impact of the high cost of energy which is twice higher than in the USA, or Russia. Especially, EU gas is three to four times more expensive [for EU companies] than for the USA, the Russian and the Indian competitors.”</P><P>Hatzidakis said the Greek EU presidency was preparing a letter with concrete proposals on energy prices for the spring EU summit on 20-21 March that will feature a debate on industrial competitiveness.</P><P>But he warned that the Greek EU presidency “cannot work out miracles within six months”.</P><P>“What we can do is lay the foundation for the new European Commission that will be formed after the elections to bring forward concrete legislative proposals,” Hatzidakis said.</P><P><STRONG>‘Nice words’</STRONG></P><P>This came as a major disappointment for business representatives who claim ministers shied away from stating the obvious, that current energy and <mark>climate change</mark> policies deteriorate the EU’s competitiveness and therefore urgently need correction.</P><P>Instead of clear-cut language, the <A href=""http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/intm/141115.pdf"">meeting’s conclusions</A> listed a number of research papers, including one by the European Commission on the <A href=""http://register.consilium.europa.eu/doc/srv?l=EN&amp;t=PDF&amp;gc=true&amp;sc=false&amp;f=ST%205599%202014%20REV%201"">high cost of energy</A> in Europe, but stopped short of saying what needs to be done to correct the situation.</P><P>In the US, cheap shale gas has turned around the fortunes of the world’s largest economy. The cost of electricity in the United States is a third or half that of the EU and gas prices are just one third of those seen on the old continent.</P><P>“The USA currently attracts massively industrial investments and jobs: This is a true industrial renaissance in the US,” said Peter Botschek of the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC), which represents 29,000 companies, producing about a fifth of the world’s chemicals.</P><P>By contrast, EU statements about an “industrial renaissance” were just “nice words”, Botschek told EURACTIV.</P><P><STRONG>‘More and better jobs’</STRONG></P><P>The European Commission’s ‘<A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/4108/attachments/1/translations/en/renditions/native"">Industrial Renaissance</A>‘ paper is scheduled to be on the table of the next meeting of EU heads of state and governments on 20-21 March, which will mainly focus on “growth, competitiveness and jobs”.</P><P>But Botschek said that the EU’s recurring calls for “more and better jobs” would remain empty words if the Commission did not back it with actual policy measures.</P><P>Both CEFIC and BusinessEurope, the powerful employer’s association, have underlined the reforms they believe are necessary to that end and will drive those points home again ahead of the March and June European Council meetings of heads of state and government.</P><P>“Indeed the re-industrialisation of Europe is the hostage of an ambitious goal given the relatively high energy costs,” said Botschek, adding that energy costs have been relatively higher in Europe than in other regions for many years.</P><P>“Two factors are changing the game,” he said – the emergence of shale gas in the US and increasing energy costs in Europe, where energy policy is “subdued to <mark>climate policy</mark> ambitions”.</P><P>“We did so by creating <mark>carbon</mark> costs, surcharges and taxes in order to stimulate low-<mark>carbon</mark> investment and to subsidise power production from alternative – but largely uncompetitive and unreliable – energy sources such as solar and wind. Those energy sources have been granted priority access to the grids thereby undermining the EU’s energy market design and the EU’s energy market liberalisation policies that aim for an EU Internal Energy Market to be realised in 2014,” Botschek explained.</P><P>The CEFIC representative said EU policies should instead focus on diversifying energy supplies, putting in place a functioning single energy market, and introduce <mark>climate</mark> policies that encourage rather than hinder growth in the manufacturing sector.</P><P>Botschek admitted that such policies would likely run into fierce opposition from environmentalists and some policymakers. “But we have seen also a massive campaign in the run-up to the Commission proposal for the 2030 framework, all geared at pushing further on the current policy which entails higher costs for Europe,” he contended.</P><P>“20 million unemployed in Europe speak their own language and this cannot continue to be ignored,” Botschek stressed, underlining the negative economic consequences of the EU’s “unilateral” <mark>climate</mark> policies.</P><P><STRONG>2030 targets for renewable energy and <mark>climate change</mark></STRONG></P><P>A European Commission consultation document, or ‘Green Paper’, for the EU’s 2030 <mark>climate</mark> and energy policy mentions a potential greenhouse gas emission-reduction target of 40%, and does not close the door on a 30% target for the proportion of energy that renewables should make up by 2030.</P><P>For the German chemical company <mark>BASF</mark>, the difference in energy price between Europe and the US is already driving investment decisions that may have consequences down the line for industrial jobs in Europe and Germany.</P><P>“Our sites are in competition with each other and with such a huge difference in energy prices, the decision is clear – the money is not going there [in Europe],” said Claus Beckmann, head of <mark>BASF</mark>’s energy and <mark>climate policy</mark> unit.</P><P>He cautioned however that decisions to relocate factories or build new ones would not happen overnight but over the long run. “It’s a question of time,” Beckman told journalists at a briefing at <mark>BASF</mark> offices in Brussels on 25 February. “We think the market for chemicals will increase in the future. The question is only where the production will be located.”</P><P>“It depends on what the public is willing to pay for <mark>climate</mark> action,” added Brigitta Huckestein, a senior manager for energy and <mark>climate policy</mark> at <mark>BASF</mark>. “I do not believe that the public is aware of this – that it will cost them money if they are going for such a high goal.”</P><DIV class=""ea-article-custom""><DIV class=""ea-article-custom-item""><H4>Positions</H4><DIV><P><STRONG>The European Federation of Waste Management and Environmental Services (FEAD)</STRONG> called on the European Commission to revise the draft guidelines on environmental and energy state aid for 2014-2020 so the recycling industry is also protected from higher energy costs resulting from funding of support to energy from renewable sources.</P><P>FEAD members draw attention to the fact that the draft Guidelines stress that state aid should be limited to sectors that are exposed to a significant risk of <mark>carbon</mark> leakage due to the funding of support to energy from renewable sources.</P><P>“If the draft Guidelines recognise that state aid should be limited <EM>only </EM>to sectors that are exposed to a significant risk of <mark>carbon</mark> leakage, the European private waste management industry would have to face high energy costs. Recycling activity benefits the environment through the avoidance of emissions in primary production processes and EU policy is designed to encourage higher levels of recycling. The impact of higher energy prices resulting from the promotion of renewable energies could inadvertently reduce the incentive for recycling activity to be maximised across the EU”, FEAD states.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""ea-article-custom-item""><H4>Background</H4><DIV><P>In May 2013, the powerful employers’ group BusinessEurope called on European Commission President José Manuel Barroso to radically shift the EU's energy policy away from <mark>climate change</mark> mitigation towards cost-competitiveness and security of supply.</P><P>But a EU summit dedicated on energy with the objective of lowering prices and boosting the Union’s industrial competitiveness, held on 22 May 2013, ended up without major decisions.

These manufacturing systems have enabled impressive economic growth and raised the global standard of living. But as the land, water, and fossil fuel resources those systems rely on become more scarce, biology is offering new ways to engineer solutions.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Synthetic biology redesigns existing organisms for specific purposes to produce safe products that are more efficient, reliable, and predictable. Engineered microorganisms can make many of the same ingredients used in traditional industrialization processes with less energy and waste and without relying on petroleum derivatives. Synthetic biology’s breakthroughs will speed the development of biologically engineered solutions to global problems related to health, materials, energy, and environment. Its approach is multidisciplinary, bringing together biologists, engineers, software developers, chemists, and bioinformatics specialists to understand how genes work together and combine to produce useful applications. Synbio tools make the programming of biology more predictable, more like software.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">This article examines the exciting new tools being developed to solve issues I’ve spent my career tackling. It will give a historic perspective on the use of synbio to produce advanced biofuels and chemicals; look at new bio-based materials, platforms, and food; and examine what is catching investors’ interest now in industrial biotechnology and agriculture.</SPAN></P><H3>Synthetic Biology for Advanced Biofuels</H3><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">My experience with synbio (before it was called that) began at the start of the advanced biofuels industry around 2005. We were trying to get enzymes to cheaply break down cellulose and hemicellulose and to develop microorganisms to process C5 and C6 sugars for the development of advanced biofuels.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">By 2007 government exuberance was pushing technologies and companies too fast. The DOE backed the funding of </SPAN><A href=""http://www.bioenergywiki.net/DOE_Selects_Six_Cellulosic_Ethanol_Plants_for_Up_to_$385_Million_in_Federal_Funding""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">six commercial-scale projects for $385M</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> when the biology was barely off the lab bench and no one had drafted engineering plans. Venture capitalists got excited and put too much money into very early stage companies. This is what VCs do – but in this case they expected the companies to scale and commercialize as quickly as software.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">The companies scaled their technology too quickly, skipping important developmental steps. We realized that after investors put $200M into a company, the company then needed an additional $200M to build its first plant. Then, as if high capital costs and scale-up risk were not harmful enough, when the bottom fell out of the energy market during the recession, it took much of the nascent synbio biofuel industry with it. This was followed by new energy sources and tanking oil prices. Competing with $140/barrel oil was one thing, but $50 was impossible.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Then along came the blend wall and the stalling of the </SPAN><A href=""http://www2.epa.gov/renewable-fuel-standard-program""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Renewable Fuels Standard.</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> The problem here was not in biology – it was a systemic failure that no one saw coming soon enough. Many companies went bankrupt and investors closed their doors.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Today, advanced biofuels technology sits mostly with large, deep-pocketed companies. They have had some successes in building large advanced biofuels plants: Abengoa, DuPont, Poet, Beta Renewables, GranBio. Big, patient companies with other revenue streams can hold and improve the technology until such time as we have policies to support <mark>innovation</mark>. Energy markets are not free markets and don’t properly reward or support <mark>innovation</mark>. Advanced biofuel investors need policy made and maintained by a diverse set of governments. We hope to see such policy agreements come </SPAN><A href=""http://unfccc.int/meetings/paris_nov_2015/meeting/8926.php""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">out of Paris this week.</SPAN></A></P><H3>Pivot to Chemicals</H3><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Challenged by cheap oil, investor fatigue, and technical hurdles, many biofuel companies pivoted to produce alternative chemical products through fermentation. We looked for products with lower costs, lower volume, and higher value, that used biomass and bioprocesses to replace petroleum as the important building block in a number of end products including plastics, lubricants, waxes, and cosmetics.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bio-based platform chemicals are now being produced at small scale mostly above the cost of the petroleum-based products they are trying to replace. These chemicals will be at price parity when we get to large-scale production. During product development and certification, products must be tested and approved throughout the supply chain by chemical producers, product manufacturers, brand owners, retailers, and end consumers. Each stakeholder in the supply chain needs to believe the product shows equal to superior performance. Powerful end users like Coca-Cola with their 20% bio-based bottle are a huge help in pulling product through the chain. They are often willing to pay premium price at the start and can adapt their packaging lines. Each new application of a new or drop-in chemical requires testing and approval that takes time and can’t be rushed by impatient investors. </SPAN></P><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many companies like Amyris and Solazyme are developing ingredients that go into other products, such as flavors and fragrances. As in most biochemical production, the microorganism is removed after fermentation, and at a molecular level, the product is identical to the non-fermented product it is made to replace.</SPAN></P><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Three companies (Solazyme, Amyris, BioAmber) have gone public and are having to deal with being in the public markets. For the most part, the companies are moving ahead, producing products and making good partnership announcements. Their share price does not reflect their advances. A sample of the companies moving forward:</SPAN></P><UL><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Solazyme – produces oils for healthier foods; better home, personal care, and industrial products; and more <mark>sustainable</mark> fuels.

We now have a transformative skill set that allows for quick design, not discovery of new products in a predictable fashion. Biology is becoming more software driven using cloud resources, robots, machine learning, and automation. Development can be done in silico. Costs for doing work continue to go down – for example, the costs and time requirement for gene editing are falling rapidly. Zinc-finger nucleases are costly and can take up to a cost about </SPAN><A href=""http://www.biocompare.com/Editorial-Articles/144186-Genome-Editing-with-CRISPRs-TALENs-and-ZFNs/""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">$3,000 per gene and take up to a year. </SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now, using CRISPR/Cas9, the cost is </SPAN><A href=""http://www.biocompare.com/Editorial-Articles/144186-Genome-Editing-with-CRISPRs-TALENs-and-ZFNs/""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">below $500 per gene</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> for a more accurate process that takes only a week. A genome can now be sequenced for well </SPAN><A href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-01-15/illuminas-new-low-cost-genome-machine-will-change-health-care-forever""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">under $10,000 and going lower.</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> These new technologies allow product companies to stay smaller longer without burning as much cash.</SPAN><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">These tools are opening up new company and product possibilities. Three areas of interest (outside of pharma) are platform technology companies, industrial biotech, and agriculture.</SPAN></P><H3>Platform technologies</H3><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">I got a front row seat to the early stages of a platform technology company as a pre-Series A board member of Zymergen. These fast-emerging companies are developing technology to support and enable product companies. In the previous generation of biofuel/biochemical companies, R&amp;D had to staff their own microbiologists, buy their own robots, and develop their own bioinformatics systems. They had to engineer and optimize their own microorganisms to make desired products.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now product companies can get superior microbes engineered to order. With more than $100M raised among them this year, Zymergen, Ginkgo Bioworks, Synthace, and Biosyntia are relying on a mix of robotic automation, machine learning, novel software, and high-throughput screening to rapidly develop and optimize new strains to produce industrial chemicals and other bio-based products.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Tool-based companies have caught the eye of investors this year: </SPAN></P><UL><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Zymergen – brings scale and efficiency to the process of strain optimization.

Raised $344M + $160M IPO ($35/share)</SPAN></LI></UL><H3>Industrial Biotechnology</H3><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many startups are focusing on smaller scale, higher value products that do not compete with petroleum or low-margin commodities. These products require less cap-ex and have lower feedstock exposure due to smaller volumes. New products are more likely to help incumbents, not try to replace them. Here are a few examples of these new companies, their products, and money raised to date:</SPAN></P><UL><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bolt Threads – high-performance fashion fibers. Raised $40M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Gingko Bioworks  – flavors / fragrances.

Demand for animal protein is increasing in the developing world, devouring resources and creating waste. The total <mark>carbon</mark> footprint of beef is 4 pounds of greenhouse gases </SPAN><A href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/one-hamburger-environment-resources-2015-2""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">per quarter pound of meat,</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> including all the greenhouse gases released during its production.  Although taste and consumer acceptance are going to be challenges, animal protein substitutes are a great way to reduce the <mark>carbon</mark> footprint. Some companies are developing plant-based products, while others are fermentation-based:</SPAN></P><UL><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Beyond Meat – animal protein from plant protein.

Many startups are focused on the post-animal bio-economy. Groups are developing organisms to make different kinds of meat, egg and milk proteins, shark fin, and gelatin. These companies have a ways to go and their exits are far from certain. But the new products and technologies will have a positive impact on the environment.    </SPAN></P><H3>Agriculture</H3><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’ve worked for decades to commercialize advanced biotechnology tools for the development of genetically modified crops using </SPAN><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Agrobacterium</SPAN></I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> and similar methods. The new focus is on technologies considered non-transgenic in plants, biocontrol products, and plant nutrition to reduce <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and toxic inputs, use less land and water, combat pests, and increase soil fertility.</SPAN></P><P><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Feedstock for 2</SPAN></I><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">nd</SPAN></I><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> gen fuels/chemicals and power</SPAN></I></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">As we continue to expand from hydro<mark>carbon</mark>-based products to carbohydrates, we will need better plant sugars using less water, less land, and fewer inputs. As soon as there is a market pull for $20/ton biomass, there will be companies to provide it, likely using new non-GMO tools to produce better crops faster.</SPAN></P><H3>Gene editing, breeding tools</H3><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">The big six ag companies – <mark>BASF</mark>, Bayer CropScience, Dupont, Dow Chemical Company, Monsanto, and Syngenta – have invested millions of dollars in internal R&amp;D for the commercialization of genetically modified crops. They are unlikely to invest equivalent resources in building new gene editing tools to produce improved non-GMO crops. A number of companies are developing platform technologies to make gene editing faster, quicker, and better. Large seed companies will likely license, partner, and acquire these companies. Two in the forefront are Caribou, with CRISPR technology (raised $14.46M), and Cibus, using gene-editing tools to produce herbicide-resistant crops with other traits and crops on the horizon. To date three US companies are selling crop products that were engineered using gene editing techniques: Cibus – herbicide-resistant canola; Okanagan Specialty Fruits (acquired by Intrexon) – Arctic apples that resist turning brown when sliced or bruised; J. R. Simplot Company – Innate potatoes that resist bruising and produce less potentially</SPAN><A href=""http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/cancer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">cancer</SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">-causing chemical when fried.  Consumer acceptance of the apples and potatoes remains to be seen.</SPAN></P><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Regulation of gene editing techniques in crops is still ambiguous, causing some investors to be cautious. The European Commission is debating regulations of the latest techniques, and they may classify plants as GMOs even if they lack foreign DNA. In the United States, modifying plants with </SPAN><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Agrobacterium</SPAN></I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> requires regulation by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, but plants modified by gene editing (ZFN, TALEN, and CRISPR/Cas based methods) are not currently regulated. In July, the White House launched a multiyear initiative to review federal regulations on agricultural biotechnology so the rules could change. </SPAN></P><P style=""text-align: left;""><I><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Microbial Solutions: Inoculants, biocontrol, stimulants</SPAN></I></P><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the beginning of my career, I worked on commercialization of natural biocontrol products produced from sources such as the Neem tree and naturally occurring fungi. We just couldn’t make them financially viable. Now scientists can develop new products to improve crop health by discovering, developing, and altering what naturally occurs in the microbiome of plants and soils. Microbial products are made from microbes that work alone or complement traditional methods of plant production and protection. Products can protect crops from pests and disease, combat resistance, and enhance plant productivity and fertility. Inoculant and biocontrol products can be applied on broad acre crops such as corn and soy, and on fruits and vegetables to help plants take up nutrients and defend against pests, disease, and weeds. </SPAN><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Novozymes and Monsanto have formed the BioAg Alliance to catalyze the development of new microbial solutions to address this market. In November, Syngenta and DSM announced a </SPAN><A href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-06/syngenta-ties-with-dsm-in-race-for-bacteria-based-crop-products""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">collaboration </SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">that will focus on creating bio-controls, bio-pesticides, and bio-stimulants. A number of smaller companies are developing technologies as well:</SPAN></P><UL><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;""> AgBiome – researching plant-associated microbiome to discover new biological and trait genes. Raised $34.5M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Symbiota – improve plant health and growth by promoting a healthy microbiome. Raised $7.5M</SPAN></LI><LI style=""font-weight: 400;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Agrimetis – natural product-derived compounds to protect crops from weeds, fungal diseases, and insect pests. Raised $7.3M</SPAN></LI></UL><H3>Exits</H3><P style=""text-align: left;""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">A number of IPOs and acquisitions occurred in the first group of biofuels and biochemical companies with varying degrees of shareholder benefit. I was at Codexis, the first of the group to go public, when we IPOed. Codexis and other early IPO companies have remade themselves a number of times and their value is mostly unrecognized in the public markets. Amyris, Solazyme, Codexis, Gevo, and Metabolix are all trading below $3 a share. REG and Bioamber are trading around $8. Without knowing the financial details, it is unlikely the acquisitions of LS9, OPX, Cobalt, and Verenium were major windfalls for investors. Investment and attitudes will shift for this sector as we develop a price scheme for <mark>carbon</mark> to drive the use of non-petroleum-based products and advanced biofuels.</SPAN><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">With all of the seed round and Series A money going into platform, ag, and early-stage biomaterials companies, there is a concern about valuations getting too high and successful routes to exit. Middle-stage capital is missing in this space; medium-size companies have trouble making it to revenues. Raising C or D rounds has been tough. As happens with new asset classes and sectors, most investment firms tracking the industry have yet to build a substantial track record and a route to exit. Private equity firms have played a relatively limited role in the agriculture technology and biomaterials space so far. One of the main reasons is that few of them have been focused on the sector due mostly to the early stage of the companies.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Two examples of acquisitions include Bayer’s $425M acquisition of AgraQuest, the biologicals company, in June 2012 from Otter Capital and Generation Investment Management. In November 2012, <mark>BASF</mark> acquired Becker Underwood, a biological seed treatment, from Norwest Equity Partners for $1.02B. A few IPOs have occurred in the ag space including Marrone Bio <mark>Innovation</mark>s, the biopesticide company, and Arcadia Biosciences, the agriculture traits producer. Marrone is currently trading 80% below its IPO price and Arcadia is 65% below IPO price. Both deals were downsized on low demand and priced below initial share price target range.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Strategic investors like the Big 6 in ag have played a role in building excitement around the sector and its exit potential. Investors outside the industry – giants like Microsoft and Google – could soon become participants and buyers in ag and biomaterials/products. They will make for interesting competitors for incumbents. </SPAN></P><H3>Going Forward</H3><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">We are in the golden age of biology. With the development of exciting new tools, we can engineer plants and microorganisms to make better, cheaper, and unique products. Many of the solutions I have worked on over my career were not financially viable at the time. We now are able to iterate faster and get to market and revenues more quickly with lower costs. It’s why I never say, “I’ve tried that, it didn’t work.” We just didn’t have the right tools yet. We may never get all segments of the population to say the words “<mark>climate change</mark>,” but society is looking for technologies that make us more resilient and adaptable. This change will help lead us to a price scheme on <mark>carbon</mark>, stimulating investment back into advanced biofuels and chemicals. We will adopt new bio-based materials that reduce the demand for protein sources like beef and eggs for a world with more people and fewer resources. Technologies that allow us to produce more food, fuel, and fiber with fewer inputs will make it to market and create shareholder, consumer, and environmental returns.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">In Paris this week the top global leaders announced the launch of “</SPAN><A href=""http://mission-<mark>innovation</mark>.net/""><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mission <mark>Innovation</mark></SPAN></A><SPAN style=""font-weight: 400;"">,” a 20-country initiative to accelerate public and private global clean energy <mark>innovation</mark> to address global <mark>climate change</mark>, provide affordable clean energy to consumers, and create additional commercial opportunities in clean energy.

At the moment, there are large amounts of traffic on urban streets that create an increase in air <mark>pollution</mark> and loud noise. From our conversations with city officials, we’ve learned that future mobility services can only be successful if they can efficiently connect public transport and individual mobility.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">We presented our conception of future mobility during <mark>BMW</mark>’s 100 year anniversary with the <mark>BMW</mark> VISION NEXT concept cars. The car of the future is autonomous, connected, electric, <mark>sustainable</mark>, and, if desired, shareable between multiple clients.

The joint task of the team is to engage with leaders of big cities and analyze their needs. This is at the prerequisite for developing new urban mobility solutions together with cities.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><STRONG>What do you see as the barriers to achieving large scale <mark>sustainable</mark> urban mobility?</STRONG></P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">There are currently big differences in how electro-mobility is being promoted in different countries and cities. Positive examples, like Norway, show what can be achieved with a proactive effort – one in three new cars is electric. Unfortunately, there is a lack of adequate electric vehicle charging infrastructure in many cities worldwide.

Within the framework of our ten sustainability goals, we have targets for our products, services, production, and supply chain. In this way, we want to significantly reduce the <mark>CO2</mark> emissions of our vehicles, be a leading provider of electro-mobility, and permanently change mobility behaviour in cities.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">At the same time, we are continuing to pursue our goal of further reducing <mark>CO2</mark> emissions at our production facilities. We are increasing the energy efficiency of our facilities and are investing in renewable energy. Our vision is to ultimately have a completely emissions-free production process. To achieve this, we increased the share of renewable energy in our purchased energy mix to 63%. We built wind turbines at our Leipzig plant, where we build our <mark>BMW</mark> i vehicles. Our Oxford plant is relying on solar energy, while our Rosslyn, South Africa plant uses biogas. In the US we use energy sources such as hydropower as well as methane gas. There are countless examples of how we are achieving our energy goal step by step.</P><P style=""text-align: justify;""><STRONG>How does your involvement with Formula E support your <mark>BMW</mark>i/urban mobility offering?</STRONG></P><P style=""text-align: justify;"">While de<mark>carbon</mark>ization is the key theme of our industry, the <mark>BMW</mark> Group has a strong athletic identity in its brand and production.

On one hand, strict regulation is forcing automotive companies to rethink their manufacturing processes to comply with the new rules. On the other hand, a growing penetration of electric vehicles with a more environmentally conscious supply chain, puts additional pressure on the conventional car industry. Therefore, a key management concern is how to reduce <mark>CO2</mark> emissions and become more <mark>sustainable</mark> across all of the company’s processes. Supply chain processes are key in this strategy since traditional supply chain emissions can be greater than those from direct operations.</P><P><mark>BMW</mark> is the example of a company that is redefining its business model in reaction to the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>. In 2016, <mark>BMW</mark> was named the world’s most <mark>sustainable</mark> automotive company by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index<A href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"">[1]</A>.

In addition to these training programs, <mark>BMW</mark> started a sustainability awareness program in which they participate in industry wide events with key talks on sustainability.

During that time, <mark>BMW</mark> asked owners of its electric cars if they would be willing to delay recharging them by an hour on the company's cue.</P><P>An app notified the owners when a delay was coming, and they could opt out if they needed to charge at that time.</P><P>&quot;Eighteen months later, I can unequivocally state that participation was transparent, hassle-free and mind-numbingly dull to the point that I mostly forgot about it,&quot; one participant, John Higham, wrote in a <A href=""http://insideevs.com/18-month-real-world-trial-proves-electric-vehicles-can-stabilize-the-grid/"">first person account</A> of his experience for Inside EVs.</P><P>The trial led <mark>BMW</mark> and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E), the utility for Northern California, to suggest that if electric vehicles become as popular as expected, electric vehicle demand management could become a powerful tool for supporting grid flexibility.</P><P>&quot;The overall lesson is we can use resources likes electric vehicles to help support the grid during times of peak use,&quot; said Ari Vanrenen, a spokesman for PG&amp;E.</P><P>Renewable energy experts have long held the theory that electric vehicles will play a momentous role in helping the electric grid be more flexible. EVs could be deployed to buffer uneven power generation of wind and solar. Owners might, for example, wait to charge their cars until the height of the day, when solar is most plentiful and cheapest. Or, they might delay their charging during peak hours in the early evening, when the grid is under the most stress.</P><P>As of now, customer sensitivity to prices is still an unknown quantity. While the <A href=""http://www.pgecurrents.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/PGE-<mark>BMW</mark>-iChargeForward-Final-Report.pdf""><mark>BMW</mark>-PG&amp;E partnership</A> tested only whether customers would agree to delay their demand by an hour if given a financial incentive, it offered some concrete evidence that influencing customer behavior is possible.</P><H3>How <mark>BMW</mark> Managed Demand</H3><P>For the test, PG&amp;E asked <mark>BMW</mark> to build a system that could remove 100 kilowatts of demand from the grid on short notice.</P><P>PG&amp;E could make the call at a random time. Of particular interest to the utility was whether demand could eventually be decreased during <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/14062017/solar-renewable-energy-negative-prices-california-power-grid-solutions"">peak load hours</A> of 4 p.m. to 7 p.m., when solar power is waning for the day and demand on the grid ramps up.</P><P><mark>BMW</mark>'s app would signal to customers that a one-hour delay was coming. If the car was connected to a charging station at that time, <mark>BMW</mark> could trigger the charging delay through software in the vehicle. Participants were paid $1,000 up front to participate in the study and $540 more depending on how many times their vehicle participated in the request for a one-hour delay.</P><P>If <mark>BMW</mark> could not meet the power reduction goal through delaying customer charging, it was encouraged to supply the necessary charging through its own battery storage center.</P><P>Throughout the 18-month test period, which ended in December 2016, customers were asked to delay 209 times. <mark>BMW</mark> was able to meet its obligations to reduce power about 90 percent of the time, however only 20 percent came from owner demand reduction and 80 percent come from <mark>BMW</mark>'s battery storage.   </P><H3>The Challenge of Charging Times</H3><P>While that seems far from conclusive, the results have to be seen in the context of a small pool of drivers whose vehicles would have to be connected to a charging station when the request came in. <mark>BMW</mark> found an average of only about seven of the nearly 100 cars involved were typically available to participate when a reduction request was announced. A lack of EV charging at work lowered the numbers.</P><P>If the time of the request came between 11 p.m. and 2 a.m., when cars were more likely to be plugged into their home charging stations, vehicle owners were much more likely to participate in the delay.</P><P>Since 93 percent of the participants stated that they liked the program and would be willing to participate in a similar program going forward, PG&amp;E said it was eager to conduct a larger second phase. The California Energy Commission has given <mark>BMW</mark> a grant to lead that second phase with support from PG&amp;E that has already begun.</P><P>As more and more EVs hit the road, programs like this have broad promise, the companies said.</P><P>&quot;We can extrapolate to the future likely load reduction from plug-in vehicle drivers, as EV adoption increases,&quot; said Rebecca Kiehne, a spokesman for <mark>BMW</mark> North America. &quot;If we assume 20 percent of all existing EV owners enroll in a similar program, and behave similarly, a single future event might result in a load drop big enough to power approximately 58,000 homes in California.&quot;</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""tagged-with""><LABEL>Published Under:</LABEL></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>",0,2,Neutral,,

<BODY><DIV id=""main""><DIV class=""wrapper active""><DIV class=""single_post""><H1><mark>Carbon</mark> Offsets Connection to Solving <mark>Climate Change</mark></H1><H3 class=""date"">Monday, 11 June 2012</H3><P>Environmental organizations, I believe, do a notoriously poor job communicating for our audience the positive of what we do, the results we achieve and the change we accomplish, whether they focus on <mark>carbon</mark>, energy, water, smog, soil or any number of environmental problems. The ability to connect business leaders, consumers and environmental activists with the positive <mark>climate</mark> results we aim to solve is crucial. I often feel we do a better job highlighting the problem (also critical), but not on sharing the results. So I want to address how <mark>carbon</mark> offsets, or <mark>carbon</mark> credits, help reduce the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, catalyze encourage low <mark>carbon</mark> technology and help pave the way to a cleaner, more <mark>sustainable</mark> environment for all of us.</P><P>The first step is to address that a <mark>carbon</mark> offset represents a reduction of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions from a project, in a manner verified by outside third-parties and using outside third-party standards, such as the Verified <mark>Carbon</mark> Standard, American <mark>Carbon</mark> Registry and <mark>Climate</mark> Action Reserve. The paper trail for a <mark>carbon</mark> offset shows these projects reduced emissions, whether from renewable energy, energy efficiency or forestry. This is one reason we give our supporters the choice of which types of projects to support and why we remain agnostic on which type of project is ‘better’. <mark>Carbon</mark> dioxide reductions are the goal, not the project type.</P><P>It is this connection of the project to the greenhouse gas reduction (<mark>carbon</mark> offset or <mark>carbon</mark> credit) that also ties it to solving <mark>climate change</mark>. Our planet does not care either where we emit <mark>carbon</mark> emissions or where we reduce them. Bali or Boston, same impact. <mark>Climate change</mark> is not impacted differently if a reduction comes from within a company’s premises or outside its premises. (This is different for other gases such as SO<SUB>2</SUB>, which causes acid rain and has a localized and regional impact, meaning it affects the area nearer to where it is emitted.)</P><P>So another benefit, then, is that <mark>carbon</mark> offsets allow us to direct funds to reducing <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions in the most cost effective manner. If <mark>carbon</mark> is <mark>carbon</mark> is <mark>carbon</mark>, then making a $100 donation going to reduce ten tonnes of <mark>carbon</mark> is more efficient than the same amount reducing just five tonnes.</P><P>What’s more, this brings about technology transfer and, often, international development. Since many developing countries are very inefficient in how they generate and manage their energy use, reducing emissions in the developing world is often much more cost effective than trying to make a <mark>BMW</mark> factory in Germany even more efficient than it already is. <mark>Carbon</mark> offsets enable this transfer of assets to reduce greenhouse gases cost efficiently, while still maintaining the verification and standards necessary to know the reductions are happening.</P><P><mark>Carbon</mark> offsets also bring more people to the table in terms of education about <mark>climate change</mark> and engagement in the solution. Most developing countries are not obligated to reduce their <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions and feel a strong sense they should not have to, while they are still developing (a topic for another day). However, when a <mark>carbon</mark> offset project comes to Brazil, India or China, local businesses, policy makers and individuals get to learn about and be part of the solution. This creates both knowledge transfer and buy in. And if the company is profiting from the project, which we would hope they are, even better for buy-in.</P><P>If we are going to solve <mark>climate change</mark> in the next few decades and stop a pending disaster, we simply must reduce our emissions substantially, by as much as 50-80% by mid-century. The less scary way of putting this is for us to aim for a 2% reduction in <mark>carbon</mark> emissions annually, but first we have to stop the growth. <mark>Carbon</mark> offsets are helping solve <mark>climate change</mark> in efficient ways by directing these massive investments toward the most efficient <mark>carbon</mark> reduction opportunity while benefitting both the <mark>climate</mark> and people.. In our best scenario, this efficiency spurs greater investment than would otherwise occur, which helps drive down the costs of new, clean, low-<mark>carbon</mark> technologies and projects. Ultimately, if enough investment helps wind, solar or another technology cost less than coal (a debatable figure but also a topic for another day), market transformation will occur based on straight economics and that will be a very good day for our planet, <mark>climate</mark> and us.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2,0,Neutral,,

Temperature measurements are taken by both land and sea all over the world by several international organizations. Groups like NASA, NOAA, and the UK Met Office keep and manage their own temperature data, but they all show the same thing: the earth is warming. Overall, the planet has warmed about 1.6°F since the 1880s, and the 10 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1998. That includes 2014, which was the hottest single year on record.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""col-xs-12 col-md-4""><DIV class=""column""><H2>WHY IT'S IMPORTANT</H2><P>The rise in global temperature is the clearest single indicator of <mark>climate change</mark>. The fact that all three major dataset corroborate each other despite differences in analysis only strengthens confidence in what they show. Though 1.6°F might not sound like a big number, it has already contributed to an array of issues from melting Arctic sea ice to rising seas to shifting ecosystems, droughts and heat waves. Since the 1950s, each decade has been warmer than the last including a big jump after the 1970s. Temperatures are expected to rise even more steeply in the coming decades unless greenhouse gas emissions are curbed.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""container indicator-news""><DIV class=""row""><DIV class=""col-xs-12""><DIV class=""related-title""><H2>related News for <SPAN>Global Temperature</SPAN></H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2,0,Strongly Negative,,

Paul Everitt, the chief executive of the UK motoring trade body, the SMMT, told the Guardian the 95g target was &quot;fairly comfortable&quot; – albeit &quot;technically challenging&quot; – for manufacturers.</P><P>The German car companies are understood to favour a &quot;phase-in approach&quot;, where the cut-off date for their new fleets to meet the 95g target is pushed back to 2022, with only a percentage of their fleets required to meet it in 2020 and 2021. A similar phased-in approach was used for the 2015 target – 75% of a manufacturer's fleet must meet the 2015 target by 2013.</P><P>A new version of the leaked proposals shows that additional allowances have been given to heavier and larger vehicles since the first proposals were leaked in early June.</P><P><mark>BMW</mark> declined to comment.</P><P>Sara Ayech, <mark>climate</mark> campaigner at Greenpeace, said: &quot;The new car efficiency targets being discussed by the EU this week must not let the big polluters off the hook.

Shortly after, an international study concluded that extreme weather conditions constitute a threat to the reindeer herding culture of the Nenets people living in the Yamal Peninsula in Siberia.</P><P>“Reindeer herding cultures have been able to adapt to climatic, social and economic changes. Despite the challenges, I believe there is a future for reindeer herding,” says Associate Professor <STRONG>Timo Kumpula</STRONG>.</P><P>For several years, he’s been a member of an international research group studying the reindeer herding culture of the Yamal-Nenets people. Kumpula has also carried out extensive research into reindeer herding issues in Finland.</P><P>“For a geographer, reindeer pastures constitute an interesting topic of research. We can look at reindeer pastures from the viewpoint of lichen and draw conclusions based on that. However, reindeer husbandry is a socio-ecological system, and this makes over-grazing a difficult question, for example.”</P><P>Possible over-grazing by reindeer has been a topic of discussion in Finland and the Yamal Peninsula alike. It has been speculated that overly large reindeer flocks caused the outbreak of an anthrax epidemic in the Yamal Peninsula in spring 2016. However, another and more likely possible culprit could be the exceptionally warm summer.</P><P>“The Yamal Peninsula suffered a major anthrax epidemic in the 1940s, and dead animals were buried deep in the permafrost. Due to last summer's exceptional warmth, the active soil layer melted deeper than before, and it is suspected that this melting caused the release of anthrax pathogens.”</P><P>What does the discussion on reindeer over-grazing in Finland focus on? Several studies have established that the amount of lichen is considerably smaller in the northernmost parts of Finland than across the border in Norway. There is a reindeer fence on the Finnish-Norwegian border, preventing reindeer from moving between the two countries.</P><P>“A simple explanation is that the areas by the border on the Norwegian side are winter pastures, with reindeer grazing there only in late winter.”</P><P>On the Finnish side of the border, on the other hand, the lichen areas are summer pastures, resulting in lichen trampling and lower coverage. According to Kumpula, pasture rotation could be one solution.</P><P>“In some districts, reindeer herders practise pasture rotation, keeping winter and summer pastures separate. This prevents reindeer from trampling on fragile lichen in the summer.”</P><P>In Finland, however, the system of several reindeer owners’ associations makes pasture rotation difficult: there are 54 separate owners’ associations, each of them an independent regional administrative unit. For these associations, increasing pasture rotation would mean an increased amount of work and costs, as reindeer would have to be more intensively herded from one pasture to the next.</P><P>“Practices vary between associations. Some of them gather their reindeer inside fences for the winter and feed them there. However, there are also associations that let their reindeer graze freely, without any additional food.”</P><P>Another thing that has been totally missed in the recent over-grazing discussion is the impact of other land use on lichen pastures.  </P><P>“Most herding districts have suffered from heavy forestry, and old forests with arboreal lichens have disappeared. Arboreal lichen growing on old trees has constituted very important winter fodder for reindeer. Now that it’s gone, supplementary feeding is of course needed, and there is greater pressure on remaining ground lichen pastures.”</P><P>Lichen is only one indicator used in analysing the condition of pastures. Preliminary research findings suggest that reindeer also play a significant role in preventing the growth of shrubs in fell areas.</P><P>Kumpula and researcher <STRONG>Teemu Tahvanainen </STRONG>have studied the effects of reindeer pasturage on ground vegetation in the operating area of the Näkkälä reindeer owners’ association in Enontekiö, Finnish Lapland. In the early 2000s, 15 experimental fences were set up, and the preliminary findings suggest that reindeer help in keeping fell vegetation at bay.</P><P>“In the experimental areas, willows have started to gain length. In Norway, shrub vegetation was higher in the fell areas, possibly contributing to the fact that snow melts away sooner there. This, in turn, affects global warming.”</P><P>Global warming constitutes a challenge for the traditional reindeer herding culture of the Nenets people in the Yamal Peninsula in particular. In winter 2013–2014, exceptionally large areas used for reindeer pasturing froze after heavy rain, resulting in the death of more than 60,000 reindeer.</P><P>The pasture areas froze because of exceptionally low ice coverage in the Barents Sea and the Kara Sea, and that brought humid air masses to land and caused rain on snow.</P><P>“If the sea remains open longer and more often, these kinds of climatic phenomena will become increasingly frequent. Pasture freezing is more common towards the west, but <mark>climate change</mark> is moving the boundary of unsettled weather conditions increasingly eastwards,” Kumpula says.</P><P>In Fennoscandia, pasture freezing is not that significant a problem for reindeer herding, as there is a possibility to provide reindeer with additional food.</P><P>“In the Yamal Peninsula, however, providing additional food is not a possibility, as the area doesn’t have fields or an extensive road infrastructure. If widespread pasture freezing becomes common in the Yamal Peninsula, making additional food available to reindeer could be a solution for preventing large-scale reindeer deaths.”</P><P>However, if reindeer herders continue to struggle with <mark>climate</mark>-related problems, the traditional livelihood may lose its appeal among the younger generations.</P><P>“So far, the younger generations have wanted to continue reindeer herding and living on the tundra.”</P><P>The study on the effects of pasture freezing on reindeer husbandry in the Yamal Peninsula was published in Biology Letters in November 2016. The study constituted part of a series of studies led by the Arctic Centre of the University of Lapland, with the University of Eastern Finland participating in them.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""footerwrapper""><DIV class=""socialwrapper""><DIV class=""social""><SPAN class=""soclabel"">Follow UEF:</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2,0,Neutral,,The text is not about bmw

Comte fell into fashion photography when, in 1980, Karl Lagerfeld asked the then 25-year-old to shoot a Chloé campaign. Since then, he’s worked with Givenchy, Nike, <mark>BMW</mark>, Hennessy, and many others, and photographed Jeremy Irons, Mike Tyson, Miles Davis, Helena Christensen, Naomi Campbell, Louise Bourgeois, and Sharon Stone. Before, during, and after this era of editorial and commercial work, however, the Swiss artist developed—and continues to explore—another interest: <mark>climate change</mark>. </P><P>Now Rome museum <A href=""http://www.maxxi.art/en/"" target=""_blank"">The Maxxi</A> is hosting Comte’s never-before-seen series <I> Light</I>. An avid mountaineer, the artist has spent more than 30 years documenting the rapid changes of glacial landscapes, from the Himalayas to Mount Kilimanjaro. In the exhibition, viewers will confront environmental flashpoints in close-up images of pristine, silvery landscapes that look like the products of Photoshop manipulation. Also on show are sculptures, installations, and projections. And later this month, he’ll also present <I> Black Light</I><I>, White Light</I> an expansion of <I> Light</I>, at the <A href=""http://www.triennale.org/en/"" target=""_blank"">Triennale di Milano</A>. </P><P>Above: The exterior of The Maxxi, National Museum of the 21st Century Arts, Rome, with a projection of Michael Comte's <I>Light. </I>Video mapping by Manuel Savoia.

My grandfather was one of Swissair’s three founders. His co-pilot took the very first series of photographs of the Swiss glaciers in 1914, and my grandfather and I looked at pictures from that period when I was growing up. I was also an active mountaineer until an accident in the French mountains in which my best friend was killed as we were hiking together. After that, I kept climbing, but not extreme climbing, and I began to record the mountain landscapes, in particular the glaciers.</P><DIV class=""article__media""><PICTURE class=""article__image""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 25em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612852663-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-MC_STM_DAY1_HELI_LAKE_470.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612852663-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-MC_STM_DAY1_HELI_LAKE_470.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 40.625em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612852663-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-MC_STM_DAY1_HELI_LAKE_470.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612852663-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-MC_STM_DAY1_HELI_LAKE_470.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 53.125em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612852663-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-MC_STM_DAY1_HELI_LAKE_470.jpeg?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612852663-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-MC_STM_DAY1_HELI_LAKE_470.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 65.625em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612852663-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-MC_STM_DAY1_HELI_LAKE_470.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612852663-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-MC_STM_DAY1_HELI_LAKE_470.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x""><DIV class=""article__image-caption"">From Michael Comte's <I>Light</I>, 2017.

How did <I> Light</I>, specifically, come about?</B> In 1975, before even starting university, I wrote an essay about the limits of growth called “Water Is the Oil of the Future” and was invited to speak in front of <A href=""https://www.clubofrome.org/"" target=""_blank"">The Club of Rome</A>, one of the first organizations concerned about the environment. Then, in 1986, I spent a year in the Tibetan Himalayas. I met a group of Chinese scientists at a very remote monastery and we talked about water. They told me: “The reason China is in Tibet has nothing to do with the Dalai Lama or religion. The Chinese are here because Tibet is the water reserve for China’s future.” These scientists predicted a great ice melt between the years 2005 and 2010. </P><P>I returned to Switzerland and found scientific data that confirmed the glaciers were retreating 20 centimeters a year. This intrigued me and it’s why I decided to inspect all of the glaciers in the Himalayas over a period of two years. What I discovered was shocking. I went to one glacier and a year later 50 <I> meters</I> were lost, not 20 centimeters. I went to another glacier and, in one year, we lost 300 meters. I went to British Columbia and climbed Mount Kilimanjaro; there was no snow in some places. I thought to myself, “Wow, we really have a problem,” and that was how this project was born.</P><DIV class=""article__media""><PICTURE class=""article__image""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 25em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612898710-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-R0010395.jpeg?resize=400:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612898710-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-R0010395.jpeg?resize=600:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 40.625em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612898710-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-R0010395.jpeg?resize=650:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612898710-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-R0010395.jpeg?resize=975:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 53.125em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612898710-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-R0010395.jpeg?resize=850:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612898710-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-R0010395.jpeg?resize=1275:* 2x""><SOURCE media=""(max-width: 65.625em)"" srcset=""https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png"" data-srcset=""https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612898710-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-R0010395.jpeg?resize=1050:*, https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1510612898710-Michel-Comte-Light-2017-R0010395.jpeg?resize=1575:* 2x""><DIV class=""article__image-caption"">From Michael Comte's <I>Light</I>, 2017.

In the 1970s, I was in the States and went to the Mohave Desert where I saw Michael Heizer’s <I> Double Negative. </I>I also liked the stone pieces that [Joseph] Beuys did and I was very taken by Robert Smithson’s <I> Spiral Jetty </I>and Walter De Maria’s <I> Lightning Field.</I> I was also a producer of <I> Trouble Makers </I>(<I>The Story of Land Art</I>), a film by James Crump. I’ve always been obsessed with land art as a form of contemporary art, and <I> Light </I>is extremely related to this.</P><P><B> What prompted you to leave fashion behind and focus on art?</B> You know, I don’t like retrospectives. I get tired of the same questions being asked over and over. I especially disliked the stigma of being a “star photographer.” It was always the worst thing anyone could ever call me. I never ever felt I was working with stars. My relationships with many of the people I worked with lasted 25 to 30 years. People like Louise Bourgeois, Jeremy Irons, Ben Kingsley, Sophia Loren, and William Defoe, for me, were not only celebrities; they were so much more. When an assignment had a celebrity angle, it had to be fascinating in a strange way, like Sharon Stone—those pictures were mad. </P><P>This “star” stigma is one of the things I’ve been working to get rid of. It was very difficult and involved building new relationships with galleries and museums based on a very different perception of me and my work. I am now working with great museums that give me creative freedom and <A href=""https://galerieursmeile.com/contemporary-chinese-art-beijing-china-lucerne-switzerland.html"" target=""_blank"">Galerie Urs Meile</A>, Beijing, represents my work worldwide.

I stress here the word, “known”, as statisticians are able to say that, as there are trillions of planets in the universe, millions of them must support life. We also know of many planets, orbiting stars, which are said to be, “Goldilocks” planets, as they are, as Goldilocks would say, just right. But they are only just right as far as the position and size go, for liquid water, and surface gravity, as we have no idea, really, whether they could support life, or not. Add into these uncertainties, the fact that the nearest star is 4 light years away, which is approximately 24 trillion miles, and all of these, so-called, “Goldilocks planets”, are much further away than that. The nearest is about 12 light years away. Our current methods of space travel, allow speeds of around 160,000 mph, using  gravitational slingshots, but by rockets alone, can only reach around 30,000 mph. It would take about 15,000 years to get to even the nearest star, by current technology, making those “Goldilocks” planets as much of a fairy-tale as the original story.</P><P align=""justify"">So let’s focus on the real story, which is our own little planet Earth , which, as I said, is the only planet in the universe known to be able to support life, and the only home we have. On the Earth we have just the right temperature. Our position relative to the sun should make the Earth a relatively cold planet, an ice planet, rather than the blue planet we know today. During the ice age it was a cold planet, and what we believe ended that was a change in the Earth’s atmosphere through volcanic activity, which caused more of the Sun’s radiant energy to be retained. So, now, we have the right temperature, just about the right amount of water, and land, just the right solid composition, and at this distance from the sun, we have just the right atmosphere. This is an atmosphere just right for both us, and plants, to symbiotically coexist, in the constant exchange of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, and oxygen between us. The Earth has just the right humidity, and the right conditions for rainfall. It has the magnetic field that prevents the solar wind from blowing our atmosphere away. We have the ozone layer which protects us from savage levels of ultraviolet radiation. So, all of this is just right, as Goldilocks would say, and the Earth is really the only planet we can say, with any certainty, is “The Goldilocks planet”.</P><H5 align=""justify"">Life and Water</H5><P align=""justify"">The conditions for the survival of life on this planet are so precarious and unusual that our existence is something of a miracle. Look at the behaviour of water, for example. We all learn at school that as things get colder they contract, and having the same mass, are therefore more dense. Water behaves in the same way, but when it reaches 4°C, it starts to expand again, and become less dense, so that the solid form of water, ice, is less dense than the water, and floats on the top of it. In the winter, instead of the coldest water falling to the bottom and freezing at the bottom, it is the water at 4°C that falls to the bottom, so ice, which is less dense, forms on the top. This allows aquatic creatures to survive in the liquid water at the bottom. So, if it were not for the peculiar behaviour of water, aquatic life and therefore, possibly, life on land, would not have been possible. This just adds to all those other things I have mentioned, the ozone layer, the magnetic field, and so on, without which, our life would not be possible, and which make this planet Earth so unique.</P><H5 align=""justify"">The Tree of Knowledge, and The Garden of Eden</H5><P align=""justify"">In the past few hundred years there has been a great evolution in awareness, of the nature of our planet. Prior to Copernicus and Galileo people thought that the Earth was at the very centre of the entire universe, and even that the Earth was the entire universe, with the sun and moon being lights put into the sky by God for the convenience of mankind. The stars were merely fairy lights to decorate the night sky for our amusement. It was a very comforting picture, and that we, like little children on our playground, were being looked over by the great Father God, to see that all was well, and no harm could come to us.</P><P align=""justify"">Since the time it was accepted that Copernicus, and Galileo, were correct, and that the Earth travels around the sun, we have made more and more startling discoveries about the nature of the universe, and now know that the Earth is no more than a speck of dust in a boiling cauldron of chaos. If cosmologists are correct, eventually the stars will all fade, one by one, and the universe will become an infinite, lifeless, expanse of nothingness, and darkness, enduring for ever. This is all quite a dramatic shift of perspective for us to have to face, and, just as in the Garden of Eden, eating from the Tree of Knowledge has cast us out from childlike innocence, to an adulthood, full of insecurity, and uncertainty.</P><H5 align=""justify"">Grown-up Responsibilities, and Challenges</H5><P align=""justify"">We know that the conditions for the survival of life on this planet are so precarious and unusual that our life is much more of a miracle than it seemed, even in those comforting days when we thought the Earth was our playground, permanent, safe, and secure. We now have to understand that the continuance of life on this planet is our responsibility, and considering the supreme idiocy, carelessness, and ignorance, displayed by so many, the thought that our survival depends on all people, and nations, cooperating is a scary thought.</P><P align=""justify"">There are known hazards that we will have to deal with sometime in the future. We might, or might not, survive the merging of the Milky Way galaxy with Andromeda, which is hurtling towards us. At some time in the future, all the hydrogen in the sun will have been converted to helium, at which point the precarious balance between gravity, and the explosive outpourings of energy from the sun, will shift to allow an expansion, and our Sun will become a red giant, and our little planet Earth, a glowing ember inside the Sun’s outer atmosphere. Before that, the Earth’s core might cease to generate the magnetic field, which protects us from the ferocious solar wind emanating from the Sun, and all our atmosphere might be swept away. Before that, super-volcanoes, such as at Yellowstone national park in the USA might erupt, filling the atmosphere with ash, and blotting out the sun’s warmth for months.</P><H5 align=""justify"">Rocks in Space</H5><P align=""justify"">In the 18th C, when scientists thought that planetary motion worked just like their clockwork models, with perfect spheres moving in perfect circles, in perfectly empty space, the idea that shooting stars might be pieces of space rock burning up in the atmosphere, was refuted by the bland statement, by the French Scientist, Antoine <EM>Lavoisier</EM>, “Stones cannot fall from the sky, because there are no stones in the sky.” This is a good illustration of how we tend to impose our concepts upon reality, and refuse to see what is in front of our faces. Now we know that there are countless millions of rocks, hurtling about in space, and the Earth could be struck by one at any time, with catastrophic consequences. There are people monitoring all those near-Earth objects, but, so far, we have not come up with any concerted effort to ensure that we would be able to do anything about any one of them being on a collision course with our planet.</P><H5 align=""justify"">Initiative Test</H5><P align=""justify"">Although there are so many hazards in the future there is one hazard that is with us right now, and if there were a Father God, it is just the sort of thing they might have come up with as an initiative test, a kind of easy one to start with, to see if mankind is capable of co-operating, and working together, in a rational way, to overcome a simple problem, before we have to go on to survive much more difficult problems in the future. So, how are we doing? Not very well I fear.</P><H5 align=""justify"">When Did we First Know About Global Warming?</H5><P align=""justify"">Beginning with work by Joseph Fourier in the 1820s, scientists had understood that gases in the atmosphere might trap the heat received from the Sun. As Fourier said,</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px"" align=""justify"">“Energy in the form of visible light from the Sun easily penetrates the atmosphere to reach the surface and heat it up, but heat cannot so easily escape back into space, for the air absorbs invisible heat rays, (‘infra-red radiation’), rising from the surface.”</P><P align=""justify"">The warmed air radiates some of the energy back down to the surface, helping it stay warm. This would later be called the “greenhouse effect.”</P><P align=""justify"">In 1859, the Irish physicist, John Tyndall, demonstrated that some gases have the ability to absorb radiant heat, so explaining, and confirming, the greenhouse effect. Tyndall set out to find which, if any, gases in the atmosphere could absorb radiant heat. He identified several gases that did so, including water vapour, and <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (<mark>CO2</mark>).</P><P align=""justify"">Svante Arrhenius was a Swedish scientist who was the first to claim, in 1896, that burning fossil fuels might cause global warming. He hypothesised a correlation between <mark>CO2</mark> concentrations in the atmosphere and temperature. He believed that the average surface temperature of the earth is about 15°C because of the capacity of water vapour and <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide to absorb radiant heat. This he called the greenhouse effect. Arrhenius suggested a doubling of the <mark>CO2</mark> concentration would lead to a 5°C temperature rise. He, and Thomas Chamberlin, calculated that human activities would warm the Earth by adding <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide to the atmosphere.</P><P align=""justify"">In 1938, G.S. Callendar argued that concentrations of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide were increasing and raising global temperature. By the 1950s most scientists accepted the idea of global warming, and believed that <mark>CO2</mark> plays a crucial role in <mark>climate change</mark>, so that rising levels would have significant consequences.</P><P align=""justify"">In 1959 the Physicist, Teller, gave a warning to the US Oil Industry that burning fossil fuels could cause global warming. <A href=""https://cleantechnica.com/2018/01/03/edward-teller-warned-oil-industry-<mark>carbon</mark>-dioxide-<mark>climate</mark>-change-6-decades-ago/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">(See CleanTechnica Article)</A></P><P align=""justify"">He said –</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P style=""text-align: justify"">Whenever you burn conventional fuel, you create <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide. [….] The <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide is invisible, it is transparent, you can’t smell it, it is not dangerous to health, so why should one worry about it? <mark>Carbon</mark> dioxide has a strange property. It transmits visible light but it absorbs the infra-red radiation which is emitted from the Earth. Its presence in the atmosphere causes a greenhouse effect [….] It has been calculated that a temperature rise corresponding to a 10 per cent increase in <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. All the coastal cities would be covered, and since a considerable percentage of the human race lives in coastal regions, I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.</P><P> </P><P style=""text-align: justify"">At present the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere has risen by 2 per cent over normal. By 1970, it will be perhaps 4 per cent, by 1980, 8 per cent, by 1990, 16 per cent [about 360 parts per million, by Teller’s accounting], if we keep on with our exponential rise in the use of purely conventional fuels. By that time, there will be a serious additional impediment for the radiation leaving the earth. Our planet will get a little warmer. It is hard to say whether it will be 2 degrees Fahrenheit or only 1°, or 5°.</P><P style=""text-align: left"" align=""justify"">But when the temperature does rise by a few degrees over the whole globe, there is a possibility that the ice-caps will start melting and the level of the oceans will begin to rise. Well, I don’t know whether they will cover the Empire State Building or not, but anyone can calculate it, by looking at the map, and noting that the ice-caps over Greenland, and over Antarctica, are perhaps 5,000 feet thick.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">From July 23rd, to the 27th, 1979, a scientific assessment of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, and <mark>climate</mark>, was made, and a report produced at Woods Hole, Massachusetts USA-</P><P align=""justify""><A href=""http://www.ecd.bnl.gov/steve/charney_report1979.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">http://www.ecd.bnl.gov/steve/charney_report1979.pdf</A></P><P align=""justify"">This was a report to the <mark>Climate</mark> Research Board, the Assembly of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and the National Research Council. In that report they stated –</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">For more than a century, we have been aware that changes in the composition of the atmosphere could affect its ability to trap the sun’s energy for our benefit. We now have incontrovertible evidence that the atmosphere is indeed changing, and that we ourselves contribute to the change. Atmospheric concentrations of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide are steadily increasing, and these changes are linked with man’s use of fossil fuels and exploitation of the land. Since <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide plays a significant role in the budget of the atmosphere it is reasonable to suppose that continued increases would affect <mark>climate</mark>.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">In their conclusion they stated –</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">Having examined the principal attempts to simulate the effects of increased atmospheric <mark>CO2</mark> on <mark>climate</mark>, we can assume a rate of increase that would lead to a doubling of airborne concentration at some time in the first half of the 21st-century. From this doubling we can predict a global surface warming of between 2° and 3.5° Celsius. However, it is expected that absorption of heat in the oceans, will initially mitigate the effects of warming, but that warming will eventually turn, and the associated regional climatic changes may well be significant.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">An article appeared in Inside <mark>Climate</mark> News by Neela Banerjee, Lisa Song and David Hasemyer</P><P align=""justify""><U><A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/15092015/exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/15092015/exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming</A></U></P><P align=""justify"">In the article they say –</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">In July 1977, at a meeting in Exxon Corporation’s headquarters, a senior company scientist named James F. Black delivered a sobering message: <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide from the world’s use of fossil fuels would warm the planet and could eventually endanger humanity.</P><P align=""justify"">In 1978, he warned Exxon scientists and managers that independent researchers estimated a doubling of the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (<mark>CO2</mark>) concentration in the atmosphere would increase average global temperatures by 2 to 3 degrees Celsius (4 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit), and as much as 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit) at the poles. Rainfall might get heavier in some regions, and other places might turn to desert.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">The article goes on to say that at first, Exxon responded by launching its own research into <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide from fossil fuels, and its impact on the Earth, but then began to see it mainly as a problem that posed an existential threat to the oil business. Toward the end of the 1980s, <A href=""http://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/sites/default/files/documents/Exxon%20Review%20of%20<mark>Climate</mark>%20Research%20Program%20%281981%29.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><U>Exxon curtailed its <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide research</U></A>. and worked, instead, at the forefront of <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/topic/<mark>climate</mark>-denial"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><mark>climate</mark> denial</A><U>,</U> to create doubt about the reality of global warming. It lobbied against federal and international action to control greenhouse-gas emissions, and helped to erect a vast edifice of misinformation that stands to this day. The millions of dollars Exxon had spent since the 1990s on <mark>climate change</mark> deniers had long surpassed what it had once invested in <mark>climate</mark> science.</P><H5 align=""justify"">Current <mark>Climate Change</mark> Deniers</H5><P align=""justify"">So, here we have it. Though Trump, and his administration, like to pretend that there is no such thing as global warming, that it is all a hoax invented by the Chinese, and have even eradicated all mention of it on government websites, and although the US oil industry, appears to have taken the opportunity to spread misinformation, and doubt, concerning <mark>climate change</mark>, science has been well-established starting from the early part of the 19th century, and there is absolutely no doubt that our <mark>climate</mark> is deteriorating, due to our own activities, and if these activities are not brought under control there is a very real danger that the Earth will no longer be able to support life. It seems extraordinary to me that individuals are willing, and able, to put their short-term economic interests above the continuation of life on Earth, by creating and spreading these false denials of <mark>climate change</mark>. Such is the unfathomable stupidity, and wickedness of some, living amongst us. Equally unfathomable are those who, for no better reason than to inflate their own egos, disseminate these falsehoods, on websites, social media, and comments. They add to the delay of urgent protection for all life on Earth, just so that they can pretend to be members of the inner-circle, with the “insider knowledge” that other mere mortals, including 98% of the worlds <mark>climate</mark> scientists, do not possess.</P><H5 align=""justify"">What We Need to do Now.</H5><P align=""justify"">Had we started to do something about this 50 years ago, we would not need to do much at all right now, and if the politicians had started to actually do something at the time they just started to talk about doing something, the situation would not be as desperate as it is now. So far, despite all the talk, greenhouse gas emissions are still increasing, and to make it worse, the ability of our planet to absorb the greenhouse gas emissions is also being reduced by foolish human activity. Global warming, that has already started, is, itself, causing more greenhouse gas to be released, from the thawing Tundra, for example, so creating a self accelerating process. This is accelerated further by the loss of heat reflective white surfaces at the poles, as the ice melts. All of this makes the need for our intervention very urgent, and our action needs to be immediate, robust, and extensive.</P><P align=""justify"">Every Nation, needs to introduce new legislation today, which will ensure and encourage, investment in, and development of, renewable sources of energy, and which will expedite the installation of what ever renewable energy plant is currently available. They also need to lay definite plans for the phasing out of all fossil fuel burning, as alternatives become available, and to make every effort to make those alternatives available, as soon as possible. This would include fossil fuel burning in power stations, transport, and for domestic, and industrial, space heating, and in manafacturing.</P><P align=""justify"">In the area of transport, this would need measures for encouraging the adoption of electric vehicles, and positively discouraging the use of ICE cars, buses, and trucks. Ships trains, and planes will also need to cease using fossil fuels, and can use biofuels, or where practical be converted to use renewable energy directly. All trains can be electric, as many are already.</P><P align=""justify"">In the area of power generation, extensive use needs to be made of wind generators, both on-shore, and off-shore, solar panels to be installed wherever possible, and sufficient storage installed on the grid to buffer the mismatch between peak production, and peak demand. All other methods of energy harvesting, such as hydro, wave, tidal, and geothermal, need to be developed and utilised as soon as possible, and all the power produced by fossil fuels must be replaced by renewable energy sources at the earliest possible moment.</P><P align=""justify"">For space heating, renewable energy systems are already available, such as solar heat panels, and heat pumps operated by renewable electricity. Air conditioning can also be powered by renewable electricity. It is also possible to produce gas from bio-materials, from otherwise non-productive land. <A href=""https://cleantechnica.com/2017/12/09/rock-star-dale-vince-founder-of-ecotricity-interview/"">(See CleanTechnica Article)</A></P><P align=""justify"">In general, it must be made illegal to seek out any new sources of fossil fuels, or to drill any exploratory well, or mine, to test for the existence of fossil fuel deposits. All current fossil fuel production must cease, and wells and mines decommissioned, as soon as alternative energy sources become available. To put it more simply, all fossil fuels must be left in the ground as soon, and as much, as is practically possible.</P><P align=""justify"">We then need to look at energy efficiency so that the energy we are producing is not wasted. We also need to be conscious of the means by which <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide already in the atmosphere is absorbed. Plants, from microscopic phytoplankton in the ocean, to forest giants, are all absorbing <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, and releasing oxygen, and without this process we could not live. We need to nurture and manage all of the land on the planet, and the oceans, to maximise the total of plant life, and plant health.</P><H5 align=""justify"">Methane – The Other Green-House Gas</H5><P align=""justify"">I have mentioned <mark>CO2</mark> so far, but methane is a much more potent greenhouse gas, and is released into the atmosphere from the following three sources-</P><OL><LI><P align=""justify"">Any rotting organic material, on farms, landfill sites, and occurring naturally in peat bogs, and the like.</P></LI><LI><P align=""justify"">Bovine animals reared for food, of which there are billions of individuals in the world today. They release methane through the mouth, in the process of digestion of plant material.</P></LI><LI><P align=""justify"">Oil and gas wells, from which methane constantly leaks, unless carefully managed.</P></LI></OL><P align=""justify"">It is simply not <mark>sustainable</mark> to continue consuming animals as food, and we all need to stop doing this for environmental, moral, and health reasons. If you must eat meat, eat birds or fishes, or when it comes in, the new “lab” meat. Methane from rotting material needs to be carefully managed, and can be used as a bio-fuel. Methane oxidizing bacteria can be employed to stop methane emissions, but these become decreasingly  effective from temperatures above 20 degrees Celcius. Methane from oil and gas wells will cease, once those wells are decommissioned, and in the meantime, need to be carefully managed. Methane from wells is a fossil fuel, and so should not be used.</P><P align=""justify"">As individuals we need to look at our own lifestyle, to reduce our use of energy and maximise our energy efficiency. This can be by large investments such as photovoltaic cells, wind turbines, electric vehicles, ground source heat pump installations, and home insulation, and also simple, low, or no, cost choices, such as changing what we eat, and how extravagant, or otherwise, we are in our use of energy. People also need to stop voting for irrational politicians like Trump, in the US, and The Tories, in the UK.</P><P align=""justify"">This ends Part I of this article: <A href=""https://evobsession.com/planet-earth-the…e-change-part-ii/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">in Part II</A>, coming soon, I will be talking about the contrast between what we need to do, as laid out above, but in more detail, and what we are actually doing, and the huge gap between what governments say, and what they are actually doing.</P><P align=""justify"">In the meantime you can follow me on <A href=""https://twitter.com/AndyMilesco"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Twitter</A>.</P> </DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2,0,Neutral,,

I stress here the word, “known”, as statisticians are able to say that, as there are trillions of planets in the universe, millions of them must support life. We also know of many planets, orbiting stars, which are said to be, “Goldilocks” planets, as they are, as Goldilocks would say, just right. But they are only just right as far as the position and size go, for liquid water, and surface gravity, as we have no idea, really, whether they could support life, or not. Add into these uncertainties, the fact that the nearest star is 4 light years away, which is approximately 24 trillion miles, and all of these, so-called, “Goldilocks planets”, are much further away than that. The nearest is about 12 light years away. Our current methods of space travel, allow speeds of around 160,000 mph, using  gravitational slingshots, but by rockets alone, can only reach around 30,000 mph. It would take about 15,000 years to get to even the nearest star, by current technology, making those “Goldilocks” planets as much of a fairy-tale as the original story.</P><P align=""justify"">So let’s focus on the real story, which is our own little planet Earth , which, as I said, is the only planet in the universe known to be able to support life, and the only home we have. On the Earth we have just the right temperature. Our position relative to the sun should make the Earth a relatively cold planet, an ice planet, rather than the blue planet we know today. During the ice age it was a cold planet, and what we believe ended that was a change in the Earth’s atmosphere through volcanic activity, which caused more of the Sun’s radiant energy to be retained. So, now, we have the right temperature, just about the right amount of water, and land, just the right solid composition, and at this distance from the sun, we have just the right atmosphere. This is an atmosphere just right for both us, and plants, to symbiotically coexist, in the constant exchange of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, and oxygen between us. The Earth has just the right humidity, and the right conditions for rainfall. It has the magnetic field that prevents the solar wind from blowing our atmosphere away. We have the ozone layer which protects us from savage levels of ultraviolet radiation. So, all of this is just right, as Goldilocks would say, and the Earth is really the only planet we can say, with any certainty, is “The Goldilocks planet”.</P><H5 align=""justify"">Life and Water</H5><P align=""justify"">The conditions for the survival of life on this planet are so precarious and unusual that our existence is something of a miracle. Look at the behaviour of water, for example. We all learn at school that as things get colder they contract, and having the same mass, are therefore more dense. Water behaves in the same way, but when it reaches 4°C, it starts to expand again, and become less dense, so that the solid form of water, ice, is less dense than the water, and floats on the top of it. In the winter, instead of the coldest water falling to the bottom and freezing at the bottom, it is the water at 4°C that falls to the bottom, so ice, which is less dense, forms on the top. This allows aquatic creatures to survive in the liquid water at the bottom. So, if it were not for the peculiar behaviour of water, aquatic life and therefore, possibly, life on land, would not have been possible. This just adds to all those other things I have mentioned, the ozone layer, the magnetic field, and so on, without which, our life would not be possible, and which make this planet Earth so unique.</P><H5 align=""justify"">The Tree of Knowledge, and The Garden of Eden</H5><P align=""justify"">In the past few hundred years there has been a great evolution in awareness, of the nature of our planet. Prior to Copernicus and Galileo people thought that the Earth was at the very centre of the entire universe, and even that the Earth was the entire universe, with the sun and moon being lights put into the sky by God for the convenience of mankind. The stars were merely fairy lights to decorate the night sky for our amusement. It was a very comforting picture, and that we, like little children on our playground, were being looked over by the great Father God, to see that all was well, and no harm could come to us.</P><P align=""justify"">Since the time it was accepted that Copernicus, and Galileo, were correct, and that the Earth travels around the sun, we have made more and more startling discoveries about the nature of the universe, and now know that the Earth is no more than a speck of dust in a boiling cauldron of chaos. If cosmologists are correct, eventually the stars will all fade, one by one, and the universe will become an infinite, lifeless, expanse of nothingness, and darkness, enduring for ever. This is all quite a dramatic shift of perspective for us to have to face, and, just as in the Garden of Eden, eating from the Tree of Knowledge has cast us out from childlike innocence, to an adulthood, full of insecurity, and uncertainty.</P><H5 align=""justify"">Grown-up Responsibilities, and Challenges</H5><P align=""justify"">We know that the conditions for the survival of life on this planet are so precarious and unusual that our life is much more of a miracle than it seemed, even in those comforting days when we thought the Earth was our playground, permanent, safe, and secure. We now have to understand that the continuance of life on this planet is our responsibility, and considering the supreme idiocy, carelessness, and ignorance, displayed by so many, the thought that our survival depends on all people, and nations, cooperating is a scary thought.</P><P align=""justify"">There are known hazards that we will have to deal with sometime in the future. We might, or might not, survive the merging of the Milky Way galaxy with Andromeda, which is hurtling towards us. At some time in the future, all the hydrogen in the sun will have been converted to helium, at which point the precarious balance between gravity, and the explosive outpourings of energy from the sun, will shift to allow an expansion, and our Sun will become a red giant, and our little planet Earth, a glowing ember inside the Sun’s outer atmosphere. Before that, the Earth’s core might cease to generate the magnetic field, which protects us from the ferocious solar wind emanating from the Sun, and all our atmosphere might be swept away. Before that, super-volcanoes, such as at Yellowstone national park in the USA might erupt, filling the atmosphere with ash, and blotting out the sun’s warmth for months.</P><H5 align=""justify"">Rocks in Space</H5><P align=""justify"">In the 18th C, when scientists thought that planetary motion worked just like their clockwork models, with perfect spheres moving in perfect circles, in perfectly empty space, the idea that shooting stars might be pieces of space rock burning up in the atmosphere, was refuted by the bland statement, by the French Scientist, Antoine <EM>Lavoisier</EM>, “Stones cannot fall from the sky, because there are no stones in the sky.” This is a good illustration of how we tend to impose our concepts upon reality, and refuse to see what is in front of our faces. Now we know that there are countless millions of rocks, hurtling about in space, and the Earth could be struck by one at any time, with catastrophic consequences. There are people monitoring all those near-Earth objects, but, so far, we have not come up with any concerted effort to ensure that we would be able to do anything about any one of them being on a collision course with our planet.</P><H5 align=""justify"">Initiative Test</H5><P align=""justify"">Although there are so many hazards in the future there is one hazard that is with us right now, and if there were a Father God, it is just the sort of thing they might have come up with as an initiative test, a kind of easy one to start with, to see if mankind is capable of co-operating, and working together, in a rational way, to overcome a simple problem, before we have to go on to survive much more difficult problems in the future. So, how are we doing? Not very well I fear.</P><H5 align=""justify"">When Did we First Know About Global Warming?</H5><P align=""justify"">Beginning with work by Joseph Fourier in the 1820s, scientists had understood that gases in the atmosphere might trap the heat received from the Sun. As Fourier said,</P><P style=""padding-left: 30px"" align=""justify"">“Energy in the form of visible light from the Sun easily penetrates the atmosphere to reach the surface and heat it up, but heat cannot so easily escape back into space, for the air absorbs invisible heat rays, (‘infra-red radiation’), rising from the surface.”</P><P align=""justify"">The warmed air radiates some of the energy back down to the surface, helping it stay warm. This would later be called the “greenhouse effect.”</P><P align=""justify"">In 1859, the Irish physicist, John Tyndall, demonstrated that some gases have the ability to absorb radiant heat, so explaining, and confirming, the greenhouse effect. Tyndall set out to find which, if any, gases in the atmosphere could absorb radiant heat. He identified several gases that did so, including water vapour, and <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (<mark>CO2</mark>).</P><P align=""justify"">Svante Arrhenius was a Swedish scientist who was the first to claim, in 1896, that burning fossil fuels might cause global warming. He hypothesised a correlation between <mark>CO2</mark> concentrations in the atmosphere and temperature. He believed that the average surface temperature of the earth is about 15°C because of the capacity of water vapour and <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide to absorb radiant heat. This he called the greenhouse effect. Arrhenius suggested a doubling of the <mark>CO2</mark> concentration would lead to a 5°C temperature rise. He, and Thomas Chamberlin, calculated that human activities would warm the Earth by adding <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide to the atmosphere.</P><P align=""justify"">In 1938, G.S. Callendar argued that concentrations of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide were increasing and raising global temperature. By the 1950s most scientists accepted the idea of global warming, and believed that <mark>CO2</mark> plays a crucial role in <mark>climate change</mark>, so that rising levels would have significant consequences.</P><P align=""justify"">In 1959 the Physicist, Teller, gave a warning to the US Oil Industry that burning fossil fuels could cause global warming. <A href=""https://cleantechnica.com/2018/01/03/edward-teller-warned-oil-industry-<mark>carbon</mark>-dioxide-<mark>climate</mark>-change-6-decades-ago/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">(See CleanTechnica Article)</A></P><P align=""justify"">He said –</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P style=""text-align: justify"">Whenever you burn conventional fuel, you create <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide. [….] The <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide is invisible, it is transparent, you can’t smell it, it is not dangerous to health, so why should one worry about it? <mark>Carbon</mark> dioxide has a strange property. It transmits visible light but it absorbs the infra-red radiation which is emitted from the Earth. Its presence in the atmosphere causes a greenhouse effect [….] It has been calculated that a temperature rise corresponding to a 10 per cent increase in <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. All the coastal cities would be covered, and since a considerable percentage of the human race lives in coastal regions, I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.</P><P> </P><P style=""text-align: justify"">At present the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere has risen by 2 per cent over normal. By 1970, it will be perhaps 4 per cent, by 1980, 8 per cent, by 1990, 16 per cent [about 360 parts per million, by Teller’s accounting], if we keep on with our exponential rise in the use of purely conventional fuels. By that time, there will be a serious additional impediment for the radiation leaving the earth. Our planet will get a little warmer. It is hard to say whether it will be 2 degrees Fahrenheit or only 1°, or 5°.</P><P style=""text-align: left"" align=""justify"">But when the temperature does rise by a few degrees over the whole globe, there is a possibility that the ice-caps will start melting and the level of the oceans will begin to rise. Well, I don’t know whether they will cover the Empire State Building or not, but anyone can calculate it, by looking at the map, and noting that the ice-caps over Greenland, and over Antarctica, are perhaps 5,000 feet thick.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">From July 23rd, to the 27th, 1979, a scientific assessment of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, and <mark>climate</mark>, was made, and a report produced at Woods Hole, Massachusetts USA-</P><P align=""justify""><A href=""http://www.ecd.bnl.gov/steve/charney_report1979.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">http://www.ecd.bnl.gov/steve/charney_report1979.pdf</A></P><P align=""justify"">This was a report to the <mark>Climate</mark> Research Board, the Assembly of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and the National Research Council. In that report they stated –</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">For more than a century, we have been aware that changes in the composition of the atmosphere could affect its ability to trap the sun’s energy for our benefit. We now have incontrovertible evidence that the atmosphere is indeed changing, and that we ourselves contribute to the change. Atmospheric concentrations of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide are steadily increasing, and these changes are linked with man’s use of fossil fuels and exploitation of the land. Since <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide plays a significant role in the budget of the atmosphere it is reasonable to suppose that continued increases would affect <mark>climate</mark>.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">In their conclusion they stated –</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">Having examined the principal attempts to simulate the effects of increased atmospheric <mark>CO2</mark> on <mark>climate</mark>, we can assume a rate of increase that would lead to a doubling of airborne concentration at some time in the first half of the 21st-century. From this doubling we can predict a global surface warming of between 2° and 3.5° Celsius. However, it is expected that absorption of heat in the oceans, will initially mitigate the effects of warming, but that warming will eventually turn, and the associated regional climatic changes may well be significant.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">An article appeared in Inside <mark>Climate</mark> News by Neela Banerjee, Lisa Song and David Hasemyer</P><P align=""justify""><U><A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/15092015/exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/news/15092015/exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming</A></U></P><P align=""justify"">In the article they say –</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">In July 1977, at a meeting in Exxon Corporation’s headquarters, a senior company scientist named James F. Black delivered a sobering message: <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide from the world’s use of fossil fuels would warm the planet and could eventually endanger humanity.</P><P align=""justify"">In 1978, he warned Exxon scientists and managers that independent researchers estimated a doubling of the <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide (<mark>CO2</mark>) concentration in the atmosphere would increase average global temperatures by 2 to 3 degrees Celsius (4 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit), and as much as 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit) at the poles. Rainfall might get heavier in some regions, and other places might turn to desert.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P align=""justify"">The article goes on to say that at first, Exxon responded by launching its own research into <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide from fossil fuels, and its impact on the Earth, but then began to see it mainly as a problem that posed an existential threat to the oil business. Toward the end of the 1980s, <A href=""http://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/sites/default/files/documents/Exxon%20Review%20of%20<mark>Climate</mark>%20Research%20Program%20%281981%29.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><U>Exxon curtailed its <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide research</U></A>. and worked, instead, at the forefront of <A href=""https://inside<mark>climate</mark>news.org/topic/<mark>climate</mark>-denial"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><mark>climate</mark> denial</A><U>,</U> to create doubt about the reality of global warming. It lobbied against federal and international action to control greenhouse-gas emissions, and helped to erect a vast edifice of misinformation that stands to this day. The millions of dollars Exxon had spent since the 1990s on <mark>climate change</mark> deniers had long surpassed what it had once invested in <mark>climate</mark> science.</P><H5 align=""justify"">Current <mark>Climate Change</mark> Deniers</H5><P align=""justify"">So, here we have it. Though Trump, and his administration, like to pretend that there is no such thing as global warming, that it is all a hoax invented by the Chinese, and have even eradicated all mention of it on government websites, and although the US oil industry, appears to have taken the opportunity to spread misinformation, and doubt, concerning <mark>climate change</mark>, science has been well-established starting from the early part of the 19th century, and there is absolutely no doubt that our <mark>climate</mark> is deteriorating, due to our own activities, and if these activities are not brought under control there is a very real danger that the Earth will no longer be able to support life. It seems extraordinary to me that individuals are willing, and able, to put their short-term economic interests above the continuation of life on Earth, by creating and spreading these false denials of <mark>climate change</mark>. Such is the unfathomable stupidity, and wickedness of some, living amongst us. Equally unfathomable are those who, for no better reason than to inflate their own egos, disseminate these falsehoods, on websites, social media, and comments. They add to the delay of urgent protection for all life on Earth, just so that they can pretend to be members of the inner-circle, with the “insider knowledge” that other mere mortals, including 98% of the worlds <mark>climate</mark> scientists, do not possess.</P><H5 align=""justify"">What We Need to do Now.</H5><P align=""justify"">Had we started to do something about this 50 years ago, we would not need to do much at all right now, and if the politicians had started to actually do something at the time they just started to talk about doing something, the situation would not be as desperate as it is now. So far, despite all the talk, greenhouse gas emissions are still increasing, and to make it worse, the ability of our planet to absorb the greenhouse gas emissions is also being reduced by foolish human activity. Global warming, that has already started, is, itself, causing more greenhouse gas to be released, from the thawing Tundra, for example, so creating a self accelerating process. This is accelerated further by the loss of heat reflective white surfaces at the poles, as the ice melts. All of this makes the need for our intervention very urgent, and our action needs to be immediate, robust, and extensive.</P><P align=""justify"">Every Nation, needs to introduce new legislation today, which will ensure and encourage, investment in, and development of, renewable sources of energy, and which will expedite the installation of what ever renewable energy plant is currently available. They also need to lay definite plans for the phasing out of all fossil fuel burning, as alternatives become available, and to make every effort to make those alternatives available, as soon as possible. This would include fossil fuel burning in power stations, transport, and for domestic, and industrial, space heating, and in manafacturing.</P><P align=""justify"">In the area of transport, this would need measures for encouraging the adoption of electric vehicles, and positively discouraging the use of ICE cars, buses, and trucks. Ships trains, and planes will also need to cease using fossil fuels, and can use biofuels, or where practical be converted to use renewable energy directly. All trains can be electric, as many are already.</P><P align=""justify"">In the area of power generation, extensive use needs to be made of wind generators, both on-shore, and off-shore, solar panels to be installed wherever possible, and sufficient storage installed on the grid to buffer the mismatch between peak production, and peak demand. All other methods of energy harvesting, such as hydro, wave, tidal, and geothermal, need to be developed and utilised as soon as possible, and all the power produced by fossil fuels must be replaced by renewable energy sources at the earliest possible moment.</P><P align=""justify"">For space heating, renewable energy systems are already available, such as solar heat panels, and heat pumps operated by renewable electricity. Air conditioning can also be powered by renewable electricity. It is also possible to produce gas from bio-materials, from otherwise non-productive land. <A href=""https://cleantechnica.com/2017/12/09/rock-star-dale-vince-founder-of-ecotricity-interview/"">(See CleanTechnica Article)</A></P><P align=""justify"">In general, it must be made illegal to seek out any new sources of fossil fuels, or to drill any exploratory well, or mine, to test for the existence of fossil fuel deposits. All current fossil fuel production must cease, and wells and mines decommissioned, as soon as alternative energy sources become available. To put it more simply, all fossil fuels must be left in the ground as soon, and as much, as is practically possible.</P><P align=""justify"">We then need to look at energy efficiency so that the energy we are producing is not wasted. We also need to be conscious of the means by which <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide already in the atmosphere is absorbed. Plants, from microscopic phytoplankton in the ocean, to forest giants, are all absorbing <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide, and releasing oxygen, and without this process we could not live. We need to nurture and manage all of the land on the planet, and the oceans, to maximise the total of plant life, and plant health.</P><H5 align=""justify"">Methane – The Other Green-House Gas</H5><P align=""justify"">I have mentioned <mark>CO2</mark> so far, but methane is a much more potent greenhouse gas, and is released into the atmosphere from the following three sources-</P><OL><LI><P align=""justify"">Any rotting organic material, on farms, landfill sites, and occurring naturally in peat bogs, and the like.</P></LI><LI><P align=""justify"">Bovine animals reared for food, of which there are billions of individuals in the world today. They release methane through the mouth, in the process of digestion of plant material.</P></LI><LI><P align=""justify"">Oil and gas wells, from which methane constantly leaks, unless carefully managed.</P></LI></OL><P align=""justify"">It is simply not <mark>sustainable</mark> to continue consuming animals as food, and we all need to stop doing this for environmental, moral, and health reasons. If you must eat meat, eat birds or fishes, or when it comes in, the new “lab” meat. Methane from rotting material needs to be carefully managed, and can be used as a bio-fuel. Methane oxidizing bacteria can be employed to stop methane emissions, but these become decreasingly  effective from temperatures above 20 degrees Celcius. Methane from oil and gas wells will cease, once those wells are decommissioned, and in the meantime, need to be carefully managed. Methane from wells is a fossil fuel, and so should not be used.</P><P align=""justify"">As individuals we need to look at our own lifestyle, to reduce our use of energy and maximise our energy efficiency. This can be by large investments such as photovoltaic cells, wind turbines, electric vehicles, ground source heat pump installations, and home insulation, and also simple, low, or no, cost choices, such as changing what we eat, and how extravagant, or otherwise, we are in our use of energy. People also need to stop voting for irrational politicians like Trump, in the US, and The Tories, in the UK.</P><P align=""justify"">This ends Part I of this article: <A href=""https://evobsession.com/planet-earth-the…e-change-part-ii/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">in Part II</A>, coming soon, I will be talking about the contrast between what we need to do, as laid out above, but in more detail, and what we are actually doing, and the huge gap between what governments say, and what they are actually doing.</P><P align=""justify"">In the meantime you can follow me on <A href=""https://twitter.com/AndyMilesco"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Twitter</A>.</P> </DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>",2,0,Neutral,,
