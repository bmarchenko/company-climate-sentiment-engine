Generally, these were with senior level officials (cabinet members, directors-general or their deputies), but other familiar names crop up too. Connie Hedegaard, previous commissioner for <mark>climate</mark> action, has addressed an AMISA2 breakfast, as have the US ambassador to the EU; the Russian permanent representative to the EU; Giovanni Kessler, controversial Director General of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF); and top-EU-official-turned-tobacco-lobbyist <A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/revolvingdoorwatch/cases/michel-petite"">Michel Petite</A>.</P><P>Timely meetings have been held with:</P><UL><LI>Jos Delbeke, Director General, DG CLIMA on “what outcome should business expect from the COP21 <mark>Climate Change</mark> Conference in Paris” in May 2015, in the run-up to these important <mark>climate</mark> negotiations</LI><LI>Dominique Ristori, Director General, DG ENER on “The Energy Agenda” in September 2014, as the Energy Union is under-development</LI><LI>Olivier Guersent, Head of Cabinet of Michel Barnier, (then Commissioner Internal Market and Services) on the “Single Market – a Status Report” in June 2013</LI><LI>Horst Reichenbach, Head of the Taskforce for Greece, on “GREECE: Achievements and Future Challenges”, in March 2013, during the Greek debt crisis.</LI></UL><P>Georg Broadch himself, the president of AMISA2, calls himself an “Experienced Public Affairs Executive” on his <A href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/georg-brodach-1a439b"">LinkedIn profile</A> and has a history of working for major European companies. He spent 14 years with <mark>ABB</mark>, the power technology company; five years with AT&amp;T, the telecoms firm; and 10 years at German business associations.</P><P><STRONG>Corporate capture</STRONG></P><P>AMISA2’s <A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/2016-02-17_list_amisa2_membership_2016.pdf"">17 corporate </A><A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/2016-02-17_list_amisa2_membership_2016.pdf"">members</A>, as declared to CEO by Brodach, are: <mark>ABB</mark>, Airbus, Allianz, Amgen, BASF, Bayer, Dow Europe, ExxonMobil, Google, Norsk Hydro, LyondellBasell Industries, Michelin, Oracle, PGA, F. Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche), Solvay, and Total and, judging from the attendance lists at some of the breakfasts, there is a consistency about who attends the meetings from these companies. In fact, “the rule” is that only the head of a Brussels office can participate in AMISA2 breakfast meetings, so effectively that company’s top EU lobbyist.</P><P>These organisations each pay €4000 a year to be a member of AMISA2, more than enough to keep a roomful of lobbyists in croissants and coffee for a year. Presumably these membership fees are the source of the €60,000 budget declared in AMISA2’s lobby register declaration, the majority of which is spent on lobbying. AMISA2’s <A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=646699114665-12"">decl</A><A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=646699114665-12"">a</A><A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=646699114665-12"">red lobby spend</A> for 2015 is €25,000-€49,999; it’s not known on what else it spends its money.</P><P>CEO asked AMISA2 for the minutes of these breakfast meetings so that we could see exactly what is being discussed. However, Brodach <A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/email_exchanges_feb_2016.pdf"">told us</A>:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“There are no minutes and there is no result, because there is no common set of interests and the intention is not to come to a “result” whatsoever … if not to learn, understand and be educated on the topic. We are not a lobbying organization.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>But we find this disingenuous. While two chemical companies, or two energy companies might be competitors in the market place, more likely than not, they will also have very similar interests when it comes to EU policy-making. Corporations across sectors share many common interests and agendas when it comes to trade, tax, regulation and other matters. If that was not so, there would be no trade associations and no role for organisations like BusinessEurope which put forward common business demands.</P><P>Additionally, DG Trade’s <A href=""http://www.asktheeu.org/en/request/2593/response/9540/attach/4/Attachment.pdf"">internal </A><A href=""http://www.asktheeu.org/en/request/2593/response/9540/attach/4/Attachment.pdf"">minutes</A> of the meeting that Jean-Luc Demarty, Director General at DG TRADE, spoke at in February 2014 on “Recent Developments of the EU Trade Agenda” indicate that corporations get plenty of opportunity to ask questions about issues which concern their business, with Demarty providing direct one-to-one answers back. If this is any indication of how the other breakfast meetings work, it is not hard to see why senior staffers from major corporations are keen to participate in AMISA2.</P><P>And these corporations represent some of Brussels’ biggest lobbyists, between them declaring at least €28,589,000 lobby spend in the last year for which figures are available, and holding 73 European Parliament access passes. According to <A href=""http://www.integritywatch.eu/"">IntegrityWatch</A>, these corporations have, between them, held 217 lobbying meetings with the top brass at the Commission since December 2014. (All data correct as of 16 May 2016 and available in <A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/amisa2_members_in_lobby_register.xlsx"">this spreadsheet</A>.)</P><P>AMISA2 events are not advertised publicly and no one else attends. Oh, apart from “personal friends” of Brodach who are invited to ‘“beef-up” the audience.</P><P><STRONG>Transparency</STRONG></P><P>Notwithstanding Brodach’s candour when we approached him directly, AMISA2 is an opaque organisation and the lack of a website, or other public sources of information, is problematic.</P><P>Its members are not very open about their membership either. Of the 17 corporate members, only 5 (<mark>ABB</mark>, Amgen, Dow Europe, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, and Total) list AMISA2 in their lobby transparency declarations. The other 12 (71 per cent) do not bother.</P><P>But even more problematic, the Commission is also not transparent about its contacts with AMISA2. At least five of the breakfast meetings which have been held with AMISA2 since December 2014 have been held with top officials at the Commission who are <A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/3/2014/EN/3-2014-9004-EN-F1-1.Pdf"">now required to </A><A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/3/2014/EN/3-2014-9004-EN-F1-1.Pdf"">publish all their lobby meetings</A>.

Connie Hedegaard, previous commissioner for <mark>climate</mark> action, has addressed an AMISA2 breakfast, as have the US ambassador to the EU; the Russian permanent representative to the EU; Giovanni Kessler, controversial Director General of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF); and top-EU-official-turned-tobacco-lobbyist <A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/revolvingdoorwatch/cases/michel-petite"">Michel Petite</A>.</P><P>Timely meetings have been held with:</P><UL><LI>Jos Delbeke, Director General, DG CLIMA on “what outcome should business expect from the COP21 <mark>Climate Change</mark> Conference in Paris” in May 2015, in the run-up to these important <mark>climate</mark> negotiations</LI><LI>Dominique Ristori, Director General, DG ENER on “The Energy Agenda” in September 2014, as the Energy Union is under-development</LI><LI>Olivier Guersent, Head of Cabinet of Michel Barnier, (then Commissioner Internal Market and Services) on the “Single Market – a Status Report” in June 2013</LI><LI>Horst Reichenbach, Head of the Taskforce for Greece, on “GREECE: Achievements and Future Challenges”, in March 2013, during the Greek debt crisis.</LI></UL><P>Georg Broadch himself, the president of AMISA2, calls himself an “Experienced Public Affairs Executive” on his <A href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/georg-brodach-1a439b"">LinkedIn profile</A> and has a history of working for major European companies. He spent 14 years with <mark>ABB</mark>, the power technology company; five years with AT&amp;T, the telecoms firm; and 10 years at German business associations.</P><P><STRONG>Corporate capture</STRONG></P><P>AMISA2’s <A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/2016-02-17_list_amisa2_membership_2016.pdf"">17 corporate </A><A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/2016-02-17_list_amisa2_membership_2016.pdf"">members</A>, as declared to CEO by Brodach, are: <mark>ABB</mark>, Airbus, Allianz, Amgen, BASF, Bayer, Dow Europe, ExxonMobil, Google, Norsk Hydro, LyondellBasell Industries, Michelin, Oracle, PGA, F. Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche), Solvay, and Total and, judging from the attendance lists at some of the breakfasts, there is a consistency about who attends the meetings from these companies. In fact, “the rule” is that only the head of a Brussels office can participate in AMISA2 breakfast meetings, so effectively that company’s top EU lobbyist.</P><P>These organisations each pay €4000 a year to be a member of AMISA2, more than enough to keep a roomful of lobbyists in croissants and coffee for a year. Presumably these membership fees are the source of the €60,000 budget declared in AMISA2’s lobby register declaration, the majority of which is spent on lobbying. AMISA2’s <A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=646699114665-12"">decl</A><A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=646699114665-12"">a</A><A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=646699114665-12"">red lobby spend</A> for 2015 is €25,000-€49,999; it’s not known on what else it spends its money.</P><P>CEO asked AMISA2 for the minutes of these breakfast meetings so that we could see exactly what is being discussed. However, Brodach <A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/email_exchanges_feb_2016.pdf"">told us</A>:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“There are no minutes and there is no result, because there is no common set of interests and the intention is not to come to a “result” whatsoever … if not to learn, understand and be educated on the topic. We are not a lobbying organization.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>But we find this disingenuous. While two chemical companies, or two energy companies might be competitors in the market place, more likely than not, they will also have very similar interests when it comes to EU policy-making. Corporations across sectors share many common interests and agendas when it comes to trade, tax, regulation and other matters. If that was not so, there would be no trade associations and no role for organisations like BusinessEurope which put forward common business demands.</P><P>Additionally, DG Trade’s <A href=""http://www.asktheeu.org/en/request/2593/response/9540/attach/4/Attachment.pdf"">internal </A><A href=""http://www.asktheeu.org/en/request/2593/response/9540/attach/4/Attachment.pdf"">minutes</A> of the meeting that Jean-Luc Demarty, Director General at DG TRADE, spoke at in February 2014 on “Recent Developments of the EU Trade Agenda” indicate that corporations get plenty of opportunity to ask questions about issues which concern their business, with Demarty providing direct one-to-one answers back. If this is any indication of how the other breakfast meetings work, it is not hard to see why senior staffers from major corporations are keen to participate in AMISA2.</P><P>And these corporations represent some of Brussels’ biggest lobbyists, between them declaring at least €28,589,000 lobby spend in the last year for which figures are available, and holding 73 European Parliament access passes. According to <A href=""http://www.integritywatch.eu/"">IntegrityWatch</A>, these corporations have, between them, held 217 lobbying meetings with the top brass at the Commission since December 2014. (All data correct as of 16 May 2016 and available in <A href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/amisa2_members_in_lobby_register.xlsx"">this spreadsheet</A>.)</P><P>AMISA2 events are not advertised publicly and no one else attends. Oh, apart from “personal friends” of Brodach who are invited to ‘“beef-up” the audience.</P><P><STRONG>Transparency</STRONG></P><P>Notwithstanding Brodach’s candour when we approached him directly, AMISA2 is an opaque organisation and the lack of a website, or other public sources of information, is problematic.</P><P>Its members are not very open about their membership either. Of the 17 corporate members, only 5 (<mark>ABB</mark>, Amgen, Dow Europe, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, and Total) list AMISA2 in their lobby transparency declarations. The other 12 (71 per cent) do not bother.</P><P>But even more problematic, the Commission is also not transparent about its contacts with AMISA2. At least five of the breakfast meetings which have been held with AMISA2 since December 2014 have been held with top officials at the Commission who are <A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/3/2014/EN/3-2014-9004-EN-F1-1.Pdf"">now required to </A><A href=""http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/3/2014/EN/3-2014-9004-EN-F1-1.Pdf"">publish all their lobby meetings</A>.

                            Today’s increase in renewable energy production means the way electricity is generated, transmitted and distributed is changing from a traditional centralised model to a more distributed localised way of doing things. Peter Jones, technology strategy manager at <mark>ABB</mark>, explains.
                        </P><DIV class=""body-content""><P>“What we’re looking at is the idea of ‘distributed energy resource’,” says <mark>ABB</mark>’s Peter Jones. He explains the term has been coined to accommodate the fact that there are contributing factors beyond renewables that go into today’s power generation, transmission and distribution mix. “If photovoltaics (PV) or onshore wind is part of that, then so be it, but what is really important is that we are moving away from large-scale centralised generation. That’s the main issue.”</P><P>Renewables are only part of a mix covered by the term, which also includes combined heat and power (CHP) and energy storage. “One of the challenges is to operate systems that have these elements within it.” It’s a Brave New World where conventional national grids are making way for a future that includes localised micro power grids.</P><P>“Because I’ve worked with <mark>ABB</mark> for 17 years, and because I’ve come from a utilities background, I understand network planning,” says Jones. In the course of those 17 years, he has been involved in “pretty much all of the main grid technology that <mark>ABB</mark> is involved with in operational roles: high voltage DC, wind farms, energy storage, network control systems and so on. I’ve been hands-on.”</P><P>Three years ago, <mark>ABB</mark> asked Jones to review the characteristics of a changing marketplace, “and based on the toolkit of technology that we have, start clarifying what was happening specifically in the UK” with a view to analysing what technologies needed to be prioritised in response to the prevailing economic conditions. This was to further ensure the company wasn’t pushing technology “into an arena that wasn’t really ready for it. Rather, it was to understand what the market requirements were and then build a case for putting it in place.” He says that, as technology strategy manager, his brief was to look at trends and identify business cases while structuring opportunities for the application of the emerging technical <mark>innovation</mark>s he understands so well.</P><P>Having spent “30-plus years in the industry”, Jones spent his early career working in areas such as centralised planning and design standards at a time when the market was dominated by fossil fuels and nuclear power. “But in the past decade, there’s been this gradual change that started with wind power,” which he describes as originally being a ‘contained’ market event. Yet, as the reduction in the price of renewables had an impact on the network, it presented a challenge to the traditional areas of centralised generation, transmission and distribution. “Looking at today’s network, we are seeing a higher penetration of renewables, while advances in technology are challenging the topology of these networks. Which means that people like me are now faced with how we are going to deal with this.”</P><P>The big questions on everyone’s lips are: “How are we going to deal with power flows going in the wrong direction? How are we going to deal with generation being in the wrong location? How are we going to deal with demand that isn’t in the right place? How are we going to deal with a lack of centralised generation?” Jones sums up the position by explaining that once “there would have been a great big power station with a couple of power lines and people taking what they were given. Now we have a situation that is much more dynamic. We also have a situation where third parties are starting to come into the mix as well, and that is really quite exciting.” In the power game, he says, new players are slowly displacing the traditional players “who are looking to deliver new business models. To say this is a challenge is to understate the position, because the technology involved is considerable.”</P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""blockquote""><P>‘‘Alternative’ energy has gone beyond a societal wish. It now makes economic sense to look at decentralisation and distributed energy.’</P><FOOTER class=""blockquote-footer"">Peter Jones, technology strategy manager, <mark>ABB</mark></FOOTER></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Jones says the uptake in renewables was ‘obviously’ driven by the <mark>climate</mark> agenda, while admitting that his personal view is that “nobody really thought that it would take off to the extent that it has done”. Neither does he think we predicted adequately just how readily society would accept renewable energy. But “what people really underestimated was the price drop in the technology”. He refers to the Non Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO), the government’s primary instruments of renewable energy policy, in which emerging forms of energy supply were labelled ‘alternative’: a landscape that was regarded as either fringe or ‘nice’. Yet gradually, factors related to the decentralisation of generation “mean that renewables has gathered its own momentum, particularly with PV”.</P><P>While outliers of the movement were either visionaries or those simply on the lookout for subsidies, there was a middle ground of suppliers with a desire to provide an economically viable source of renewable energy that could contribute in a significant way to the national power mix.</P><P>In cases such as this, Jones says you’ve got to look at what is the main driver. While it is tempting to think the desire to appear ‘green’ was a strong candidate, “the main driver was the cost. In the early years, this was clearly subsidy-driven with a lot of emphasis on <mark>climate change</mark>.” Yet in the UK, “we took the approach that we would enable society’s wishes while fundamentally observing the real issue, which was cost. Our regulator has put a lot in place to enable low <mark>carbon</mark>, but it is primarily about cost. If you can put forward a solution that has <mark>carbon</mark> saving within it – which is difficult to put a value on – there is still always the question of the deliverable cost-saving to the customer.”</P><P>Today, says Jones, ‘alternative’ energy is self-sustaining, and “it can’t be stopped. This is because it has gone beyond a societal wish. It now makes economic sense to look at decentralisation and distributed energy.” The consensus in the market, he says, is that distributed energy will probably come in at a lower cost. “It is this cost argument now, rather than green credentials, that is a much more solid way of bringing this transition from centralised to distributed power into place. The early governmental subsidies for renewables were very brave. But they were always there to prime the pump for a future of distributed energy resource.”</P><P>Jones says that as a force in the power generation, transmission and distribution market, <mark>ABB</mark> provides technology to the industry “whichever way it goes”.</P><P>He means that as technologists, the company follows the market. “If it was for centralised generation and long-distance transmission, then <mark>ABB</mark> has that portfolio. If the market was for decentralised digitalisation and high levels of control ‘behind the meter’, then we have that too.</P><P>“We have the technology, but our brief is to look at what the drivers are. What we are seeing globally is that the trends are the same as in the UK,” which is a move away from large centralised generation plant that the industry is starting to view as ‘not bankable’. This implication that it makes more financial sense to work on a distributed basis can be seen “practically everywhere,” says Jones. It’s not so much that centralisation is “yesterday thinking”, as he carefully points out. “I would say that the market economics of big investments in centralised plants are less attractive in the current <mark>climate</mark>.”</P><P>At the same time, the economics of decentralisation are becoming more attractive. “At one time it was simply not thought feasible that it would be better to provide energy locally. It was always felt that the best way was to apply to a utility to get a connection. Yet now people are responding to a market pull, driven by a growing interest in available technology. They are looking to combine technologies and optimise use.”</P><P>As an example, Jones cites the Cheshire Energy Hub: “a group of customers that produces power and consumes large amounts of it”. One of its members is Peel, which has developed a 51MW onshore wind farm and through its Protos development, a 21MW biomass plant “right next to a science park. What Peel has asked is, if they were to optimise their resources locally, would that be a lower-cost solution than connecting to a traditional network?”</P><P>What’s important about this example, says Jones, is that “there are a number of people starting to think like that”. He says that where <mark>ABB</mark> comes in to a discussion like this, it isn’t to help them run the figures, but to deliver the appropriate technology to see the project through. “We can monitor and control a CHP plant and we can monitor, measure and control a biomass plant and collectively look right over the top of all this (because we have the software systems to do so), and provide data for the best solution.</P><P>“We’re speaking to customers asking us to tell them about micro-grids,” essentially investigating the feasibility of “operating as an island, only calling on the grid network when we need it. Is it possible to mix gas and electricity to reduce our energy costs? There are also third-party financial institutions looking into whether they can provide capacity into large cities.” What this means for Jones is that there are clients “asking us to show that this technology exists”.</P><P>However, it has to work financially. “The main thing about centralised power generation in the past was that it was well-​proved that economies of scale were a huge factor. Yet it was never considered that a localised approach may be cost-effective too, while also allowing for the accommodation of more renewables.” Of course, it is more complex than that, because, as Jones says, “there are many, many strands running in parallel here. There are the economies of digitisation, which now make it possible to control and monitor so many pieces of equipment.” There is also the consideration that while it is possible for centralised generation providers to accommodate renewables – and Jones states that there are providers doing a good job in this area – “there are also those that have hit the limit. For example, centralised systems in the south-west with high inclusion of PV are experiencing big constraints. During the peak in summer, there’s a large amount of power trying to flow back up transmission systems that were never designed to take that sort of flow.”</P><P>What this means is that decentralisation, with optimised digitisation and control, allows for better movement of power into areas “where it could be used, which in turn would allow you to put more renewables on the network. You get a double win: if you’re using more renewables, then you’re simply getting more from renewables. But you’re also avoiding a large amount of network reinforcement costs.”</P><P>With distributed energy, “what we are starting to see are multi-stranded benefits. It’s not straightforward or simple, but it is starting to appear.” Jones then cites the case of China – “which we think of as having large centralised coal-fired plants with large renewables up in the mountains” – that is committed to high PV and wind targets. “Because these targets are eye-wateringly high, they cannot absorb all of that renewable power into their transmission system because they can’t shift it about, and they too are running into problems. So they have a two-stranded approach. First, you put as much as you economically can onto the general system, while then having local distribution accommodated within the network. When you start talking about accommodating large amounts of renewable energy cost-effectively on a network, you’re talking distribution level, where the economics start to swing in your favour.”</P><P>What this example shows, says Jones, is that distributed energy resource isn’t just driven by the British market or the green agenda, but by engineering principles, which are, in a nutshell: “If you can’t use it, try and get it to where it’s going to be used. If you can’t use it at the right time, look to see if you can find a technology that will allow you to manage that. That’s what we are seeing globally, it’s what the market is telling us locally, and we’re seeing customer groups that are coming to us asking us if there is another way.” This ‘other way’ finds itself in that Brave New World, aligned to a cusp of technology change driven by market economic forces and, to an extent, green values targets.</P><P>What’s going to happen next? “From what I can see, the future is not going to follow the rules. There are an awful lot of network assets out there and they are not easy to change because of the money involved. So we are finding ourselves constrained by them. However, market pull is really testing this situation by demanding <mark>innovation</mark>. It’s extremely early days. Yet who would have thought that changes we have seen in other technological spheres would have happened?”</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></ARTICLE></BODY></HTML>","2","2","Positive"

As a result, a 65% discount from the levy was allowed for those sectors that agreed targets for improving their energy efficiency or reducing <mark>carbon</mark> emissions. The discount on electricity increased to an important 90% in 2013.

More and more mining companies are also looking into <mark>sustainable</mark> solutions to improve their environmental footprint.</P><P name=""301c"" id=""301c"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Mines are mainly located in areas with either good wind or photovoltaics conditions and often have little restrictions in regards of available space. With the drop in CAPEX of renewables, the cost of electricity produced by wind or photovoltaics can be significantly cheaper than any other energy source.</P><P name=""3b0d"" id=""3b0d"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">In order to use those renewable resources, <mark>ABB</mark>’s microgrid solutions (<mark>ABB</mark> PowerStoreTM) can enable a mine to often use as much as 100% renewable energy while ensuring grid stability and power quality.</P><P name=""33ce"" id=""33ce"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">According to your experience, what single change — technological, regulatory or otherwise — could further catalyse the industry?</STRONG></P><P name=""0391"" id=""0391"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">There are three very obvious catalysts. First of all, more regulatory certainty would increase the speed of growth, as more certainty usually improves the availability of financing. That’s a simple observation, but we can observe this in many projects. Any serious implementation of <mark>carbon</mark> pricing would also greatly benefit the integration of renewables and thus microgrids, that’s the second idea. Last but not least, battery prices are decreasing — any additional decrease multiplies that attractiveness of microgrids in many areas.</P><P name=""ca2f"" id=""ca2f"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">Talking about the future, where globally do you think will see the biggest expansion of microgrids in five years from now?</STRONG></P><P name=""aba4"" id=""aba4"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">We look at this less in geographies, and more in applications that geographies can have in common. The largest growth will happen in remote communities, whether this is a town in Alaska or a village in Africa. This should be followed by established utilities pushing into microgrids to lower costs and retain customer access. Another very promising parametre we expect is the growth coming from commercial and industrial applications.</P><P name=""87cd"" id=""87cd"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">How optimistic are you about “plug and play” microgrid systems like the PowerStoreTM supporting the replacement of most of the fossil fuel-based capacity in off-grid locations like mining or island utilities in the future?</STRONG></P><P name=""402e"" id=""402e"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">We are very optimistic about it. <mark>ABB</mark> has standardised and productised PowerStoreTM solutions to enable “plug and play” integration.

The Standalone is specifically built for larger sites like mining and in case battery manufacturers take a more visible role in the projects; the Hybrid system is most useful for the very small application in remote villages; and the Station and Integrated usually fit better for commercial and industrial applications.</P><P name=""7452"" id=""7452"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><STRONG class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">What is your vision for the future of off-grid electricity?</STRONG></P><P name=""9609"" id=""9609"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">I hope that off-grid areas in emerging countries will leapfrog several steps in the <mark>sustainable</mark> development and directly embrace a multi-energy infrastructure and distributed generation.

He is a frequent visitor to countries in Asia and in particular Singapore.</P><P>He joined <mark>ABB</mark> in 2001 and was involved in managing communications around many of <mark>ABB</mark>’s corporate, management, financial and environmental issues prior to his current position. He trained as a journalist and spent seven years in newspaper and broadcast journalism.</P><P>In this exclusive interview with Eco-Business, he shares how sustainability has changed the way corporates approach businesses and what drives <mark>ABB</mark> to want to be one of the world’s leading organisations on sustainability.</P><H4><STRONG>You’ve been head of sustainability since 2006, and at <mark>ABB</mark> since 2001 so you’ve seen the company through more than a decade. Can you share with us how the concept of sustainability has evolved since those early days? </STRONG></H4><P>If I look back at sustainability in corporations, in the mid to late 90s it was quite clear that the NGOs were successful in holding bigger companies to account on their environmental performance. So for many MNCs like <mark>ABB</mark>, one of our priorities then was to get our house in order, get our processes cleaner, more efficient. We looked at reducing impact when we deployed various projects; it was a process of understanding our environment impact and about environmental sustainability.</P><P>As we crossed over the millennium into the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century, we started looking more at the social aspect. So we focused on human rights and labour issues. We also looked at the other part of the triple bottom line (of people, planet and profit) – which included the financial aspect.</P><H4><STRONG>How so? Can you elaborate?</STRONG></H4><P>Today, it’s quite clear when you look at <mark>ABB</mark>’s portfolio that a large proportion of our revenues come from products that help customers reduce their environmental impact. We’re making money from helping people help the environment, and we’ve been able to embed sustainability into all aspects of our business. </P><P>At the heart of this is some dedicated hard work by our research and development colleagues who have undertaken Life Cycle Analyses of more than 100 product groups, which result in us being able to communicate solid and reliable Environmental Product Declarations that itemize the environmental impact of every aspect of a product’s life-cycle – from extracting the raw material, manufacture, in use and recycling or disposal.</P><H4><STRONG>How has <mark>ABB</mark>’s approach to sustainability changed over this past decade?</STRONG></H4><P>About 10 years ago, for example, sustainability issues in the supply chain were not on our agenda. But slowly, it was creeping up the agenda for the power industry, and was even affecting industries such as sports manufacturing. It was something that <mark>ABB</mark> didn’t think applied to it in a critical way, but it became quite clear that what happened in the consumer industry will at some stage hit the capital goods market.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><H2 class=""quote"">“</H2><P>One area we are perhaps lacking is being recognised for our contributions to a better world. We have lots of opportunities to do this and base our story on solid data and evidence. I would never greenwash. My intention is that <mark>ABB</mark>’s stories are backed by solid data.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>So we began to convince colleagues who headed supply chain that we should have some sort of oversight. Over the last three years, we’ve been working with the head of supply chain and his team to implement a supplier sustainability programme and that trains our key suppliers, particularly in India and China, on the expectations we have.</P><P>This involves addressing issues such as how we expect them to behave on social, health, safety and basic things like labour rights, like paying people the right amount of money for the work they did. We started auditing and found that they were not complying in some areas, so we decided we would go higher up the chain and we implemented a training programme to ensure suppliers understood our expectations. So it’s still a work in progress.</P><P>Sustainability is a journey and not a destination. As long as we have some milestones on our route, and we have a positive direction, then we can make some progress. I would never claim that we’ve arrived at any of our objectives or KPIs – it’s an improvement process.</P><H4><STRONG>One of <mark>ABB</mark>’s objectives, as stated publicly, is to become recognised as one of the world’s leading organisations in sustainability – where is <mark>ABB</mark> on that journey? What are some challenges you forsee in fulfilling this vision?</STRONG></H4><P>Yes of course it’s a very ambitious target to be recognised as the world’s leading companies in <mark>sustainable</mark> practices. We certainly have pockets of excellence, and we are focused on minimizing and reducing our impact. I think our health and safety performance is probably not as mature as we expected and we will double our efforts in that area.</P><P>In areas such as supply chain sustainability, I think we are making good progress. For example, we are looking at suppliers in Malaysia in the coming year and adding to India, China and Mexico, we will also include the Middle East and Saudi Arabia.</P><P>In terms of community and local stakeholder engagement, we have set some minimum activity level and standards for that engagement. For example, we have developed a standard way to engage stakeholders in a formal dialogue so we can capture their inputs from a standardised process across different countries. </P><P>In addition, while we think we make some good contributions to local communities, we have developed a tool to help us identify appropriate causes to support and to measure the positive impact of that support. One area we are perhaps lacking is being recognised for our contributions to a better world. We have lots of opportunities to do this and base our story on solid data and evidence. I would never greenwash. My intention is that <mark>ABB</mark>’s stories are backed by solid data.</P><H4><STRONG>What motivates <mark>ABB</mark>? Not all engineering companies have this focus.</STRONG></H4><P>I’ll use a hackneyed anology. We’re pushing at an open door with regards to <mark>ABB</mark> and sustainability. There are inherent qualities and benefits in reducing energy use, optimising resource use, helping customers get more bangs for their buck… this addresses all three aspects – social, economic and environmental.</P><P>So for me, it’s not that <mark>ABB</mark> has to step outside normal business activities and think about being <mark>sustainable</mark>, it’s increasingly how we do things in <mark>ABB</mark> as a mainstream activity – a business imperative.</P><H4><STRONG>Have there been instances where <mark>ABB</mark> has had to make a tough decision between bottom line performance and sustainability environmental considerations? </STRONG></H4><P>Yes, there are some examples. Sustainability is a major consideration whenever we review projects. We have a seat at the table when major projects are being discussed, and we’ve looked at it from the technical, financial and sustainability point of view.</P><P>We have walked away from bidding on projects on the basis of concerns about human rights impact. If we are not necessarily going to be able to manage the risks, then we must consider the impact it will have on our reputation.</P><P>For instance, there was a small customer project where we were concerned about forced labour issues and we declined to supply products in the end. We have such a multitude of customers across the globe, and we are held to account to our most demanding of customers even if they’re not buying from us at the moment.</P><P>If we’re highlighted in the press as helping others abuse communities and human rights, others will start asking us what we’re doing, and we don’t want to have those conversations with our customers. Avoiding the hazard – instead of managing the risk – is the better option. But we are in the business to make money, so managing the risk – if it is not a ‘deal-breaker’-  is very often something that we might end up having to do.</P><P>We are also very thorough, open and honest in identifying the risks, and we have a plan on how best to mitigate them and that can involve social, environment, health and safety, or security aspects as well.</P><H4><STRONG>In Asia, where the awareness of sustainability is minimal in some developing countries, do you face difficulties talking about these issues to your suppliers and clients? How do you approach this?</STRONG></H4><P>In Asia, it’s extremely varied. The awareness level ranges from absolute zero to 100 per cent. It’s something that is relatively new in business anyway, but the awareness is growing. To me, it demonstrates how exceptionally fast companies in the region are in terms of learning these so-called ‘non-financial ’issues.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><H2 class=""quote"">“</H2><P>It’s a win-win. We tell them (suppliers): look after your people, be a good corporate citizen, and they also end up doing more business because other global companies will buy from them.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>They are concerned not because they want to be at the forefront of human rights development, but they understand that if you want to win a project, you must do it with considerations for human rights. That’s a “permission to do business” issue and a profitability issue. If you get projects wrong in countries like in India, for example, you can expect the local community to let you know in a direct way that they don’t like it. Some have been known to barricade your roads, and these disruptions cost money. It’s better if you assess what the critical issues are early and manage them with a plan.</P><P>With regards to our contractors and suppliers, we had a wake-up call about two years ago. We thought we would do a simple audit and address some non-compliance issues and get suppliers to fix it. But in some cases, you have to explain in very simple and basic terms what you expect them to do, such as it’s not okay to put polluted water into a drain or chuck your waste in a backyard where children can get injured.</P><P>But once you start talking to them about these topics, they are very fast to appreciate the value they bring to the business. We had one supplier in India who didn’t want to come to training, and didn’t want anything to do with our audit programmes. Eventually, we got them involved and a year later, they came back saying they were 20 per cent more productive. It’s a win-win. We tell them: look after your people, be a good corporate citizen, and they also end up doing more business because other global companies will buy from them.</P><P>We’re not on a crusade to correct all the ills in the global supply chain, but within our remit, we certainly want to improve capacity and performance.</P><H4><STRONG>Does <mark>ABB</mark>’s sustainability efforts help it win customers? How about in Asia?</STRONG></H4><P>I think it certainly does. We conducted a brand perception survey here and one of the things <mark>ABB</mark> was recognised for was corporate citizenship, so sustainability is linked to our brand as well as to power and <mark>innovation</mark>.</P><P>There’s much more we can do on the sustainability side. There are many on-going discussions now about <mark>sustainable</mark> development, and we have the technology to make it happen today, rather than tomorrow. Our strong credentials also helps us to conduct dialogue on these issues around the world.</P><H4><STRONG>How do you view <mark>ABB</mark>’s role in advancing sustainability in Singapore – and more broadly in Asia- given that it has become more important in this region?</STRONG></H4><P>We see it as a tremendous growth opportunity. There’s a lot more we can do in terms of the technologies and projects that we are involved globally, and there huge opportunities for similar projects in the region. Our solutions could help the region’s development tremendously. For example, in Indonesia, almost half the population do not have access to regular electricity so <mark>ABB</mark> can be quite central to that infrastructural development and we can raise sustainability in a number of ways through our projects.</P><H4><STRONG>You were a journalist before, so can you share what stories on <mark>ABB</mark>’s sustainability journey have stood out for you?</STRONG></H4><P>There are a couple – the community impact of <mark>ABB</mark> has been quite large and global, particularly in Asia. For example, the <mark>ABB</mark> Juergen Dormann Foundation was set up in 2007 to promote and support engineering education in different parts of the world.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><H2 class=""quote"">“</H2><P>Ultimately, the story about sustainability is that every day, when <mark>ABB</mark> people get up and go to work, they are making a contribution for a more <mark>sustainable</mark> world… We’re both making money and saving the planet. It’s a pretty good gig.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>It was set up to mark Dormann’s contribution in helping <mark>ABB</mark> turn the corner in early 2000. When he retired, <mark>ABB</mark> put several million dollars into a fund that would help educate students who come from poorer backgrounds in engineering. In South Asia, for example, we have relationships with three universities in Malaysia, India and Vietnam, and worldwide the foundation has supported 70 to 80 students gain degrees that they wouldn’t have been able to achieve otherwise.</P><P>Some of them have even come to work for <mark>ABB</mark>, so that’s a great closed loop. We make a contribution to educate an individual, and we benefit from a highly-skilled engineer who enters our workforce and makes a contribution. It’s truly heartwarming, and it also illustrates how there are business benefits to such programmes. It’s a win-win situation.</P><P>Ultimately, the story about sustainability is that every day, when <mark>ABB</mark> people get up and go to work, they are making a contribution for a more <mark>sustainable</mark> world, just through their work, in making products and solutions that are more energy efficient. We’re both making money and saving the planet. It’s a pretty good gig.</P><DIV class=""eb-circle__story-cta""><H3>Thanks for reading to the end of this story!</H3><P>We would be grateful if you would consider joining as a member of The EB Circle.

Not all engineering companies have this focus.</STRONG></H4><P>I’ll use a hackneyed anology. We’re pushing at an open door with regards to <mark>ABB</mark> and sustainability. There are inherent qualities and benefits in reducing energy use, optimising resource use, helping customers get more bangs for their buck… this addresses all three aspects – social, economic and environmental.</P><P>So for me, it’s not that <mark>ABB</mark> has to step outside normal business activities and think about being <mark>sustainable</mark>, it’s increasingly how we do things in <mark>ABB</mark> as a mainstream activity – a business imperative.</P><H4><STRONG>Have there been instances where <mark>ABB</mark> has had to make a tough decision between bottom line performance and sustainability environmental considerations? </STRONG></H4><P>Yes, there are some examples. Sustainability is a major consideration whenever we review projects. We have a seat at the table when major projects are being discussed, and we’ve looked at it from the technical, financial and sustainability point of view.</P><P>We have walked away from bidding on projects on the basis of concerns about human rights impact. If we are not necessarily going to be able to manage the risks, then we must consider the impact it will have on our reputation.</P><P>For instance, there was a small customer project where we were concerned about forced labour issues and we declined to supply products in the end. We have such a multitude of customers across the globe, and we are held to account to our most demanding of customers even if they’re not buying from us at the moment.</P><P>If we’re highlighted in the press as helping others abuse communities and human rights, others will start asking us what we’re doing, and we don’t want to have those conversations with our customers. Avoiding the hazard – instead of managing the risk – is the better option. But we are in the business to make money, so managing the risk – if it is not a ‘deal-breaker’-  is very often something that we might end up having to do.</P><P>We are also very thorough, open and honest in identifying the risks, and we have a plan on how best to mitigate them and that can involve social, environment, health and safety, or security aspects as well.</P><H4><STRONG>In Asia, where the awareness of sustainability is minimal in some developing countries, do you face difficulties talking about these issues to your suppliers and clients? How do you approach this?</STRONG></H4><P>In Asia, it’s extremely varied. The awareness level ranges from absolute zero to 100 per cent. It’s something that is relatively new in business anyway, but the awareness is growing. To me, it demonstrates how exceptionally fast companies in the region are in terms of learning these so-called ‘non-financial ’issues.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><H2 class=""quote"">“</H2><P>It’s a win-win. We tell them (suppliers): look after your people, be a good corporate citizen, and they also end up doing more business because other global companies will buy from them.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>They are concerned not because they want to be at the forefront of human rights development, but they understand that if you want to win a project, you must do it with considerations for human rights. That’s a “permission to do business” issue and a profitability issue. If you get projects wrong in countries like in India, for example, you can expect the local community to let you know in a direct way that they don’t like it. Some have been known to barricade your roads, and these disruptions cost money. It’s better if you assess what the critical issues are early and manage them with a plan.</P><P>With regards to our contractors and suppliers, we had a wake-up call about two years ago. We thought we would do a simple audit and address some non-compliance issues and get suppliers to fix it. But in some cases, you have to explain in very simple and basic terms what you expect them to do, such as it’s not okay to put polluted water into a drain or chuck your waste in a backyard where children can get injured.</P><P>But once you start talking to them about these topics, they are very fast to appreciate the value they bring to the business. We had one supplier in India who didn’t want to come to training, and didn’t want anything to do with our audit programmes. Eventually, we got them involved and a year later, they came back saying they were 20 per cent more productive. It’s a win-win. We tell them: look after your people, be a good corporate citizen, and they also end up doing more business because other global companies will buy from them.</P><P>We’re not on a crusade to correct all the ills in the global supply chain, but within our remit, we certainly want to improve capacity and performance.</P><H4><STRONG>Does <mark>ABB</mark>’s sustainability efforts help it win customers? How about in Asia?</STRONG></H4><P>I think it certainly does. We conducted a brand perception survey here and one of the things <mark>ABB</mark> was recognised for was corporate citizenship, so sustainability is linked to our brand as well as to power and <mark>innovation</mark>.</P><P>There’s much more we can do on the sustainability side. There are many on-going discussions now about <mark>sustainable</mark> development, and we have the technology to make it happen today, rather than tomorrow. Our strong credentials also helps us to conduct dialogue on these issues around the world.</P><H4><STRONG>How do you view <mark>ABB</mark>’s role in advancing sustainability in Singapore – and more broadly in Asia- given that it has become more important in this region?</STRONG></H4><P>We see it as a tremendous growth opportunity. There’s a lot more we can do in terms of the technologies and projects that we are involved globally, and there huge opportunities for similar projects in the region. Our solutions could help the region’s development tremendously. For example, in Indonesia, almost half the population do not have access to regular electricity so <mark>ABB</mark> can be quite central to that infrastructural development and we can raise sustainability in a number of ways through our projects.</P><H4><STRONG>You were a journalist before, so can you share what stories on <mark>ABB</mark>’s sustainability journey have stood out for you?</STRONG></H4><P>There are a couple – the community impact of <mark>ABB</mark> has been quite large and global, particularly in Asia. For example, the <mark>ABB</mark> Juergen Dormann Foundation was set up in 2007 to promote and support engineering education in different parts of the world.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><H2 class=""quote"">“</H2><P>Ultimately, the story about sustainability is that every day, when <mark>ABB</mark> people get up and go to work, they are making a contribution for a more <mark>sustainable</mark> world… We’re both making money and saving the planet. It’s a pretty good gig.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>It was set up to mark Dormann’s contribution in helping <mark>ABB</mark> turn the corner in early 2000. When he retired, <mark>ABB</mark> put several million dollars into a fund that would help educate students who come from poorer backgrounds in engineering.

He is a frequent visitor to countries in Asia and in particular Singapore.</P><P>He joined <mark>ABB</mark> in 2001 and was involved in managing communications around many of <mark>ABB</mark>’s corporate, management, financial and environmental issues prior to his current position. He trained as a journalist and spent seven years in newspaper and broadcast journalism.</P><P>In this exclusive interview with Eco-Business, he shares how sustainability has changed the way corporates approach businesses and what drives <mark>ABB</mark> to want to be one of the world’s leading organisations on sustainability.</P><H4><STRONG>You’ve been head of sustainability since 2006, and at <mark>ABB</mark> since 2001 so you’ve seen the company through more than a decade. Can you share with us how the concept of sustainability has evolved since those early days? </STRONG></H4><P>If I look back at sustainability in corporations, in the mid to late 90s it was quite clear that the NGOs were successful in holding bigger companies to account on their environmental performance. So for many MNCs like <mark>ABB</mark>, one of our priorities then was to get our house in order, get our processes cleaner, more efficient. We looked at reducing impact when we deployed various projects; it was a process of understanding our environment impact and about environmental sustainability.</P><P>As we crossed over the millennium into the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century, we started looking more at the social aspect. So we focused on human rights and labour issues. We also looked at the other part of the triple bottom line (of people, planet and profit) – which included the financial aspect.</P><H4><STRONG>How so? Can you elaborate?</STRONG></H4><P>Today, it’s quite clear when you look at <mark>ABB</mark>’s portfolio that a large proportion of our revenues come from products that help customers reduce their environmental impact. We’re making money from helping people help the environment, and we’ve been able to embed sustainability into all aspects of our business. </P><P>At the heart of this is some dedicated hard work by our research and development colleagues who have undertaken Life Cycle Analyses of more than 100 product groups, which result in us being able to communicate solid and reliable Environmental Product Declarations that itemize the environmental impact of every aspect of a product’s life-cycle – from extracting the raw material, manufacture, in use and recycling or disposal.</P><H4><STRONG>How has <mark>ABB</mark>’s approach to sustainability changed over this past decade?</STRONG></H4><P>About 10 years ago, for example, sustainability issues in the supply chain were not on our agenda. But slowly, it was creeping up the agenda for the power industry, and was even affecting industries such as sports manufacturing. It was something that <mark>ABB</mark> didn’t think applied to it in a critical way, but it became quite clear that what happened in the consumer industry will at some stage hit the capital goods market.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><H2 class=""quote"">“</H2><P>One area we are perhaps lacking is being recognised for our contributions to a better world. We have lots of opportunities to do this and base our story on solid data and evidence. I would never greenwash. My intention is that <mark>ABB</mark>’s stories are backed by solid data.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>So we began to convince colleagues who headed supply chain that we should have some sort of oversight. Over the last three years, we’ve been working with the head of supply chain and his team to implement a supplier sustainability programme and that trains our key suppliers, particularly in India and China, on the expectations we have.</P><P>This involves addressing issues such as how we expect them to behave on social, health, safety and basic things like labour rights, like paying people the right amount of money for the work they did. We started auditing and found that they were not complying in some areas, so we decided we would go higher up the chain and we implemented a training programme to ensure suppliers understood our expectations. So it’s still a work in progress.</P><P>Sustainability is a journey and not a destination. As long as we have some milestones on our route, and we have a positive direction, then we can make some progress. I would never claim that we’ve arrived at any of our objectives or KPIs – it’s an improvement process.</P><H4><STRONG>One of <mark>ABB</mark>’s objectives, as stated publicly, is to become recognised as one of the world’s leading organisations in sustainability – where is <mark>ABB</mark> on that journey? What are some challenges you forsee in fulfilling this vision?</STRONG></H4><P>Yes of course it’s a very ambitious target to be recognised as the world’s leading companies in <mark>sustainable</mark> practices. We certainly have pockets of excellence, and we are focused on minimizing and reducing our impact. I think our health and safety performance is probably not as mature as we expected and we will double our efforts in that area.</P><P>In areas such as supply chain sustainability, I think we are making good progress. For example, we are looking at suppliers in Malaysia in the coming year and adding to India, China and Mexico, we will also include the Middle East and Saudi Arabia.</P><P>In terms of community and local stakeholder engagement, we have set some minimum activity level and standards for that engagement. For example, we have developed a standard way to engage stakeholders in a formal dialogue so we can capture their inputs from a standardised process across different countries. </P><P>In addition, while we think we make some good contributions to local communities, we have developed a tool to help us identify appropriate causes to support and to measure the positive impact of that support. One area we are perhaps lacking is being recognised for our contributions to a better world. We have lots of opportunities to do this and base our story on solid data and evidence.

Attracting manufacturers such as Audi, Jaguar, Mahindra, Renault and, from the 2019-20 season, Mercedes and Porsche, the electric single-seater series is in a position of enviably rude health.</P><P>The <A href=""/node/225290"" target=""_blank"">addition of electronics giant <mark>ABB</mark> as a title sponsor in a multi-year deal</A>, however, is potentially the biggest coup so far, with some suggesting an annual fee of around $15 million finding its way into the coffers.</P><P>It flies in the face of the current motor sport <mark>climate</mark>, one in which Santander has pulled its $40 million annual sponsorship of Formula 1 and Ferrari to enter the Champions League in 2018; McLaren enters another new season lacking a major sponsor; NASCAR continues to wrestle with Monster Energy to renew its contract and IndyCar has lost the support of Verizon.</P><P>By bringing on board a title sponsor that earns nearly $34 billion of revenue per year, Formula E has seemingly bucked the trend. Significantly, it could now turn a profit for the first time.</P><P>The results of the partnership, a week after FE made its announcement in London, were instantly clear at Marrakesh, with towering banners sporting the electronic giant’s name lining the circuit for its first round as sponsor.</P><P>But it wasn’t immediately clear why billboards sporting the <mark>ABB</mark> logo were there, or who <mark>ABB</mark> was.

In Europe, there’s been talk for years of a supergrid that would pull together power from hydroelectric dams in Scandinavia with wind farms in Germany and large solar farms in Spain and even North Africa (see “<A href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/news/405558/a-supergrid-for-europe/"">A Supergrid for Europe</A>”).</P><P>But such a supergrid has faced serious technical hurdles. The transmission lines that make up conventional power grids use alternating current (AC), which loses large amounts of power over long distances unless complicated and expensive measures are taken. DC is more efficient over long distances, and it offers the additional benefit of working well underground and underwater, reducing or eliminating the need for the unsightly transmission towers that can make it difficult to site new transmission lines.</P><P>DC lines have long been used to transmit power across the North Sea, and from large hydroelectric dams to cities.

Within five milliseconds it can stop the flow of a huge amount of power—equal to the entire output of a nuclear power plant, <mark>ABB</mark> says. The breakers could be used to nearly instantaneously reroute power in a DC grid around a problem, allowing the grid to keep functioning. “Ordinarily, if something goes wrong anywhere, all the power goes off,” says Claes Rytoft, <mark>ABB</mark>’s chief technology officer. “The breaker can cut out the faulty line and keep the rest healthy.”</P><P>Researchers have been trying to develop high-voltage DC circuit breakers for a century (see “<A href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/news/427504/edisons-revenge-the-rise-of-dc-power/"">Edison’s Revenge: The Rise of DC Power</A>”). Mechanical switches alone didn’t work—they shut off power too slowly. Power electronics made of transistors that can switch on and off large amounts of power offered a possible solution, but they proved far too inefficient. <mark>ABB</mark>’s solution combines power electronics with a mechanical switch to create a hybrid system that’s both fast and efficient. The new circuit breaker could also be far less expensive than systems that use only transistors.</P><P>“The cost of the power electronics breaker was humongous,” says Ram Adapa, a power delivery technical leader at the Electric Power Research Institute. “The hybrid breaker should be less costly.”</P><P>With the major hurdle to DC grids out of the way, <mark>ABB</mark> is now developing algorithms to control them. The system will still need to work in concert with AC lines for distributing the power in local communities, since there is no inexpensive DC equivalent of the transformers needed to step down power to the relatively low voltages used in homes and businesses. One of the first markets for the new technology could be Germany, which has decided to turn off its nuclear power plants and rely heavily on renewable energy (see “<A href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/428145/the-great-german-energy-experiment/"">The Great German Energy Experiment</A>”).</P><P>The degree to which high-voltage DC grids can help renewables may depend on the economics of installing underground cables versus overhead lines.

But Adapa is skeptical, saying that underground installations could cost five times as much.</P><DIV class=""callout--tagged-event-promo"" desc=""in-story-promo-mittr-subscribe""><P class=""callout__copy"">Cut off?

	</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>If renewable energy is ever to account for a large part of the total energy supply, countries will need to install new, large-scale transmission grids, both to get power to cities from remote areas such as deserts that often have the best renewable resources, and to combine power from widely distributed wind turbines and solar panels, which can help average out fluctuations in their output. In Europe, there’s been talk for years of a supergrid that would pull together power from hydroelectric dams in Scandinavia with wind farms in Germany and large solar farms in Spain and even North Africa (see “<A href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/news/405558/a-supergrid-for-europe/"">A Supergrid for Europe</A>”).</P><P>But such a supergrid has faced serious technical hurdles. The transmission lines that make up conventional power grids use alternating current (AC), which loses large amounts of power over long distances unless complicated and expensive measures are taken. DC is more efficient over long distances, and it offers the additional benefit of working well underground and underwater, reducing or eliminating the need for the unsightly transmission towers that can make it difficult to site new transmission lines.</P><P>DC lines have long been used to transmit power across the North Sea, and from large hydroelectric dams to cities. But until <mark>ABB</mark>’s advance, it wasn’t safe to connect DC lines into a large-scale grid.</P><P><mark>ABB</mark>’s circuit breaker changes that. Within five milliseconds it can stop the flow of a huge amount of power—equal to the entire output of a nuclear power plant, <mark>ABB</mark> says. The breakers could be used to nearly instantaneously reroute power in a DC grid around a problem, allowing the grid to keep functioning. “Ordinarily, if something goes wrong anywhere, all the power goes off,” says Claes Rytoft, <mark>ABB</mark>’s chief technology officer. “The breaker can cut out the faulty line and keep the rest healthy.”</P><P>Researchers have been trying to develop high-voltage DC circuit breakers for a century (see “<A href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/news/427504/edisons-revenge-the-rise-of-dc-power/"">Edison’s Revenge: The Rise of DC Power</A>”). Mechanical switches alone didn’t work—they shut off power too slowly. Power electronics made of transistors that can switch on and off large amounts of power offered a possible solution, but they proved far too inefficient. <mark>ABB</mark>’s solution combines power electronics with a mechanical switch to create a hybrid system that’s both fast and efficient. The new circuit breaker could also be far less expensive than systems that use only transistors.</P><P>“The cost of the power electronics breaker was humongous,” says Ram Adapa, a power delivery technical leader at the Electric Power Research Institute. “The hybrid breaker should be less costly.”</P><P>With the major hurdle to DC grids out of the way, <mark>ABB</mark> is now developing algorithms to control them. The system will still need to work in concert with AC lines for distributing the power in local communities, since there is no inexpensive DC equivalent of the transformers needed to step down power to the relatively low voltages used in homes and businesses. One of the first markets for the new technology could be Germany, which has decided to turn off its nuclear power plants and rely heavily on renewable energy (see “<A href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/428145/the-great-german-energy-experiment/"">The Great German Energy Experiment</A>”).</P><P>The degree to which high-voltage DC grids can help renewables may depend on the economics of installing underground cables versus overhead lines. Obtaining rights-of-way is one of the biggest obstacles to installing new transmission lines in many countries, and underground installations don’t require obtaining new rights-of-way, since they can be easily installed along existing roadways. <mark>ABB</mark> says that when the entire system cost is taken into account, underground installations are only slightly more expensive than overhead ones. But Adapa is skeptical, saying that underground installations could cost five times as much.</P><DIV class=""callout--tagged-event-promo"" desc=""in-story-promo-mittr-subscribe""><P class=""callout__copy"">Cut off?

The firm then went on to build its SunWave module, which features a solar panel and microinverter that attach to power poles to create a smart grid network in half an hour's time, Kuran said.</P><P>&quot;You have to think about reliability first, and solar production second,&quot; Kuran said.</P><P><STRONG>Industrial Giants, Led by <mark>ABB</mark>, Prepare for Surge</STRONG></P><P>Global manufacturing giants are already prepping themselves for the spending surge on smart grid technologies that is being spurred by utilities.</P><P>Companies like <A href=""http://www.<mark>abb</mark>.com/""><mark>ABB</mark></A>, <A href=""http://www.siemens.com/"">Siemens AG</A> and <A href=""http://www.gepower.com/"">General Electric (GE)</A>, which provide myriad services to power utility companies, are n<mark>abb</mark>ing leading telecommunications and IT firms to bolster their data-processing portfolios, hoping to secure their piece of the $34.2 billion pie.</P><P>&quot;It is a very strong move for them because it is a natural progression,&quot; Minnihan said.</P><P>He continued: &quot;The electricity industry is conservative and very slow to adopt new technologies, so if utilities have worked with a company in the past, they are more likely to adopt new smart grid technologies if they are being brought to them by a company that they already have a relationship with.&quot;</P><P>Switzerland-based <mark>ABB</mark> has led the charge. The firm provides electrical equipment at power plants and utility grids in more than 100 countries and made $32 billion in revenues in 2009.</P><P>Last May, the company spent $1 billion to acquire Atlanta-based <A href=""http://www.ventyx.com/"">Ventyx</A>, a major software, data and advisory services provider for utilities and smart grid markets. In December and January, <mark>ABB</mark> added <A href=""http://www.insertkey.com/"" target=""_blank"">Insert Key Solutions</A> (IKS) of Pennsylvania and <A href=""http://www.obvient.com/"" target=""_blank"">Obvient Strategies Inc.</A> of Georgia, both privately owned specialist software providers, to its Ventyx portfolio for undisclosed amounts.</P><P>Connecticut-based GE Energy, whose parent company made $38 billion in 2010 revenues, has gone on a spree of its own.</P><P>Last fall, it acquired large smart grid software companies <A href=""http://www.opalsoftware.com.au/"" target=""_blank"">Opal Software</A> of Australia and <A href=""http://www.snclavalin.com/ecs/en/indexen.htm"" target=""_blank"">SNC-Lavalin's Energy Control Systems</A> of Montreal for undisclosed amounts. Earlier this year, the corporation acquired Remote Energy Monitoring, a software and hardware firm in Australia and the U.K. that helps households and utilities to more efficiently manage energy usage.</P><P>German energy behemoth <A href=""http://www.siemens.com/"" target=""_blank"">Siemens</A> has similar ambitions in mind. Early last year, the company said its goal is to receive orders worth more than €6 billion, or $8.3 billion, for smart grids by 2015. The company made $38 billion in sales on energy-conserving electricity grids, wind power and solar energy last year.</P><P>&quot;The Smart Grid market will see increasingly dynamic growth fueled by <mark>climate change</mark> and economic stimulus programs. We want to grow twice as fast as the overall market,&quot; said Wolfgang Dehen, CEO of the Siemens Energy Sector, <A href=""http://www.siemens.com/press/en/pressrelease/?press=/en/pressrelease/2009/corporate_communication/axx20090981.htm"">in a press release</A>.</P><P>&quot;The world needs intelligent power grids in order to meet the growing demand for energy in a way that is eco-friendly and reliable. We estimate that the demand for electricity will double by 2030, due to trends like <A href=""http://www.energy.siemens.com/us/en/power-distribution/e-mobility.htm"">e-mobility</A>, which is just emerging,&quot; he said.</P><P>Lux Research's Minnihan said that leading networking firms like <A href=""http://www.cisco.com/""> Cisco Systems Inc.</A>, <A href=""http://www.ibm.com/"">IBM</A> and <A href=""http://www.intel.com/"">Intel</A>, plus mid-sized startups such as <A href=""http://www.silverspringnet.com/"">Silver Spring Networks</A> of Redwood City, Calif., are also gearing up to capitalize on rising demand from utilities and governments.</P><P>&quot;This is the next big market explosion for the electricity industry. It makes sense that they all want a piece of the pie,&quot; he said.</P><P>Image: Duke Energy</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN></DIV></BODY></HTML>","2","1","Strongly Positive"

Out of these applications electrical motors are having the highest share of electrical energy use, about 53 per cent. By 2030 the number of transformers and motors needed is expected to grow considerably. Most of the older motors and transformer products in use today and many of the new ones being sold waste electricity.

      city of Davos and <mark>ABB</mark> have teamed up in a long-term partnership to 
      provide e-infrastructure for public and private transportation.
    </P><P>
      Davos residents and WEF guests can experience the pioneering TOSA bus 
      for themselves. The award-winning TOSA bus, developed by <mark>ABB</mark> in 
      Switzerland, is already in use in Geneva and will soon be implemented in 
      the French city of Nantes. It can recharge its battery in just 20 
      seconds as passengers board and disembark. In Davos, it will operate on 
      the busy Line 1, running from the tourist center to the hospital. This 
      is the first time TOSA technology is being used in an Alpine region. The 
      idea is to run the system under extreme winter weather conditions; <mark>ABB</mark> 
      and its project partners expect to gain valuable insights from this 
      pilot project.
    </P><P>
      In addition, electric cars transporting attendees around Davos will be 
      able to recharge their batteries at eight newly installed <mark>ABB</mark> 
      fast-charging stations.
    </P><P>
      Collectively, the TOSA e-bus and the charging stations provide a 
      powerful, real-world demonstration of state-of-the-art <mark>sustainable</mark> 
      transportation technologies, which are seeing increased deployment 
      throughout the world as e-mobility becomes the driving force for 
      bringing energy efficiency with low environmental impact to cars, buses, 
      trains, ships and cable cars.
    </P><P>
      “The shift to electric vehicles is no longer a question of if, but 
      rather of when and how quickly,” said <mark>ABB</mark> CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer. “EVs 
      are becoming increasingly attractive to motorists. As well as being 
      ecologically responsible, they're becoming less expensive to buy and 
      maintain.”
    </P><P>
      <mark>ABB</mark> is the technology leader in the fast-charging products and systems 
      that are transforming transportation in globally <mark>sustainable</mark> ways. 
      <mark>Sustainable</mark> transportation is playing a crucial role in the fight 
      against <mark>climate change</mark>, as e-mobility begins to replace 
      fossil-fuel-powered vehicles spewing greenhouse gases contributing to 
      global warming.
    </P><P><B>Fast-charging at the World Economic Forum meeting</B></P><P>
      For e-cars, <mark>ABB</mark> is already the global leader in fast charging, with more 
      than 6,000 stations installed in more than 50 countries. At Davos, world 
      leaders will get to see the eight recently installed <mark>ABB</mark> Terra 53 
      charging stations in action. The <mark>ABB</mark> Terra 53 is the best-selling 50 kW 
      DC charging station in Europe and North America, supporting the CCS, 
      CHAdeMO and simultaneous 43 kW AC charging standards.
    </P><P>
      For public transport, the all-electric TOSA e-bus at Davos is at the 
      cutting edge of <mark>sustainable</mark> transportation <mark>innovation</mark>. Indeed, TOSA 
      received the prestigious Watt d’Or 2018 in the energy efficient mobility 
      category from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy. The TOSA technology 
      was jointly developed in Switzerland by <mark>ABB</mark> in partnership with 
      Transport Publics Genevois (tpg), the Office de Promotion of Industries 
      et des Technologies (OPI), the Services Industriels de Genève (SIG), and 
      bus manufacturer Carrosserie HESS.
    </P><P>
      The same TOSA technology in use at Davos has been powering buses on 
      Geneva's bus line 23 airport route. They use overhead contacts that 
      connect at selected stops along their routes to replenish their 
      batteries in as little as 20 seconds, recharging as passengers board and 
      exit. The environmentally friendly system in Geneva could ultimately cut 
      <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions by 1,000 tons annually.
    </P><P>
      But <mark>ABB</mark>’s <mark>sustainable</mark> transportation solutions aren't limited to 
      conventional cars and buses.
    </P><P>
      <mark>ABB</mark> supplies the railway sector with innovative and energy-efficient 
      technologies like traction transformer and converter made primarily in 
      Switzerland. One example is the Rhaetian Railway that shuttles between 
      Landquart and Davos.
    </P><P>
      In the racing world, through its recently announced partnership with the 
      Formula E electric-car racing organization, <mark>ABB</mark> will help to refine the 
      design and functionality of electric vehicles and infrastructure as well 
      as associated digital platforms.
    </P><P>
      <mark>ABB</mark> is also enabling e-mobility in ocean-going tankers, freighters and 
      passenger ships. There, <mark>ABB</mark>’s <A target=""_blank"" href=""http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fnew.<mark>abb</mark>.com%2Fmarine%2Fsystems-and-solutions%2Felectric-propulsion%2Fazipod&amp;esheet=51746724&amp;newsitemid=20180122006126&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Azipod&amp;index=1&amp;md5=91ef11b58ad0e903731583e9b679b482"" rel=""nofollow"">Azipod</A> 
      propulsion systems power vessels with steerable, high-efficiency 
      electric-drive propellers, which make ships significantly more 
      maneuverable and can reduce their need for on-board fossil fuels by 40 
      percent or more.
    </P><P>
      <mark>ABB</mark> is also taking e-mobility to new heights in cable cars. <mark>ABB</mark> motors 
      power the steepest funicular cable railway in the world, which opened in 
      the Swiss Alpine village of Stoos in December 2017. The <mark>ABB</mark> motors, 
      which deliver a total output of 2.3 megawatts, enable the cable railway 
      to carry up to 1,500 people per hour in each direction over its 1.7 
      kilometer route. <mark>ABB</mark> has also provided state-of-the-art motors and 
      drives for a newly opened, record-setting gondola system carrying 580 
      passengers an hour to the Zugspitze — Germany's highest peak.
    </P><P><B><mark>ABB</mark></B> (<mark>ABB</mark>N: SIX Swiss Ex) is a pioneering technology leader in 
      electrification products, robotics and motion, industrial automation and 
      power grids, serving customers in utilities, industry and transport &amp;

      city of Davos and <mark>ABB</mark> have teamed up in a long-term partnership to 
      provide e-infrastructure for public and private transportation.
    </P><P>
      Davos residents and WEF guests can experience the pioneering TOSA bus 
      for themselves. The award-winning TOSA bus, developed by <mark>ABB</mark> in 
      Switzerland, is already in use in Geneva and will soon be implemented in 
      the French city of Nantes. It can recharge its battery in just 20 
      seconds as passengers board and disembark. In Davos, it will operate on 
      the busy Line 1, running from the tourist center to the hospital. This 
      is the first time TOSA technology is being used in an Alpine region. The 
      idea is to run the system under extreme winter weather conditions; <mark>ABB</mark> 
      and its project partners expect to gain valuable insights from this 
      pilot project.
    </P><P>
      In addition, electric cars transporting attendees around Davos will be 
      able to recharge their batteries at eight newly installed <mark>ABB</mark> 
      fast-charging stations.
    </P><P>
      Collectively, the TOSA e-bus and the charging stations provide a 
      powerful, real-world demonstration of state-of-the-art <mark>sustainable</mark> 
      transportation technologies, which are seeing increased deployment 
      throughout the world as e-mobility becomes the driving force for 
      bringing energy efficiency with low environmental impact to cars, buses, 
      trains, ships and cable cars.
    </P><P>
      “The shift to electric vehicles is no longer a question of if, but 
      rather of when and how quickly,” said <mark>ABB</mark> CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer. “EVs 
      are becoming increasingly attractive to motorists. As well as being 
      ecologically responsible, they're becoming less expensive to buy and 
      maintain.”
    </P><P>
      <mark>ABB</mark> is the technology leader in the fast-charging products and systems 
      that are transforming transportation in globally <mark>sustainable</mark> ways. 
      <mark>Sustainable</mark> transportation is playing a crucial role in the fight 
      against <mark>climate change</mark>, as e-mobility begins to replace 
      fossil-fuel-powered vehicles spewing greenhouse gases contributing to 
      global warming.
    </P><P><B>Fast-charging at the World Economic Forum meeting</B></P><P>
      For e-cars, <mark>ABB</mark> is already the global leader in fast charging, with more 
      than 6,000 stations installed in more than 50 countries. At Davos, world 
      leaders will get to see the eight recently installed <mark>ABB</mark> Terra 53 
      charging stations in action. The <mark>ABB</mark> Terra 53 is the best-selling 50 kW 
      DC charging station in Europe and North America, supporting the CCS, 
      CHAdeMO and simultaneous 43 kW AC charging standards.
    </P><P>
      For public transport, the all-electric TOSA e-bus at Davos is at the 
      cutting edge of <mark>sustainable</mark> transportation <mark>innovation</mark>. Indeed, TOSA 
      received the prestigious Watt d’Or 2018 in the energy efficient mobility 
      category from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy. The TOSA technology 
      was jointly developed in Switzerland by <mark>ABB</mark> in partnership with 
      Transport Publics Genevois (tpg), the Office de Promotion of Industries 
      et des Technologies (OPI), the Services Industriels de Genève (SIG), and 
      bus manufacturer Carrosserie HESS.
    </P><P>
      The same TOSA technology in use at Davos has been powering buses on 
      Geneva's bus line 23 airport route. They use overhead contacts that 
      connect at selected stops along their routes to replenish their 
      batteries in as little as 20 seconds, recharging as passengers board and 
      exit. The environmentally friendly system in Geneva could ultimately cut 
      <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide emissions by 1,000 tons annually.
    </P><P>
      But <mark>ABB</mark>’s <mark>sustainable</mark> transportation solutions aren't limited to 
      conventional cars and buses.
    </P><P>
      <mark>ABB</mark> supplies the railway sector with innovative and energy-efficient 
      technologies like traction transformer and converter made primarily in 
      Switzerland. One example is the Rhaetian Railway that shuttles between 
      Landquart and Davos.

One might think -- after years of focus on global warming -- that all the easy measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions had already been deployed. And yet, as governments engage in the 21st annual conference on <mark>climate change</mark> (COP21), some surprisingly low-hanging fruit remains.</P><P>
I don’t mean small fruit, either. I’m talking about big, high-yield fruit. Consider this: fitting energy-efficient electric motors on all pumps and fans with devices to regulate their speed would save 3,338 terawatt-hours, roughly equivalent to the amount of electrical energy produced in the EU in 2013.</P><P>
The opportunity is so huge because electric motors are among the biggest consumers of energy. They power all manner of equipment and account for about 40 percent of all electricity consumed worldwide. In the European Union, they are responsible for about 12 percent of total <mark>CO2</mark> emissions, second only to space-heating products.</P><P>
In recent years, the EU, along with several countries such as the United States and China, has imposed new rules requiring older, energy-hungry motors to be phased out. These rules, known as Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS), specify the minimum acceptable efficiency levels of a product, defining which products can be marketed and sold. Typically, these MEPS become more stringent over time. In the EU, for instance, rules requiring a higher efficiency class of motors came into effect in January 2015.</P><P>
MEPS in Europe and their equivalents in other countries will ultimately lead to the upgrading of the installed base of electric motors. However, at the current pace of implementation, and taking account of loopholes and enforcement issues, they will likely fall short of the energy savings needed to achieve <mark>climate</mark> goals, especially given that global energy consumption is expected to increase by 30 percent over the next 15 years.</P><P>
One reason is that MEPS specify the efficiency of individual products, in this case electric motors, rather than the efficiency of motor systems. No matter how efficient a motor is, if it cannot regulate its speed according to load, it will always be operating at full throttle. Legislation is gradually changing to take account of this -- for instance, EU rules that came into force in January 2015 specify that certain (less-efficient) motors must be able to adjust their speed. But only around 10 percent of motors in service worldwide are currently equipped with (variable-speed) drives that allow them to do this, even though the energy savings can be substantial -- up to 50 percent in some cases.</P><P>
Another challenge is to establish common MEPS globally. Again, progress is being made in this area, with more and more countries moving toward harmonized standards, but much remains to be done. A recent study commissioned by the European Commission concluded that if the most stringent current MEPS for product energy efficiency were harmonized today, overall global energy consumption would be 9 percent lower, and energy consumption due specifically to products would be 21 percent lower. This would save 8,950 terawatt-hours of electricity, equivalent to closing 165 coal-fired power plants, or taking 132 million cars off the road.</P><P>
The clock is ticking on <mark>climate change</mark>. The weight of scientific opinion is that we don’t have much more time to turn the tide on emissions; otherwise, it will not be possible to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, which is considered the maximum temperature increase we can sustain without triggering potentially catastrophic <mark>climate</mark> events.</P><P>
Of all the actions that can and are being taken to limit <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and mitigate the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, none holds out more promise than improving energy efficiency. There are numerous measures that can be undertaken immediately, without fear of harming economic growth; indeed, since most investments in energy-efficient technology are paid back within a year or two through lower energy costs, they can significantly boost competitiveness, and through the replacement of old equipment, generate additional economic activity. Fruit doesn’t hang much lower than this.</P><P>

Legislation is gradually changing to take account of this -- for instance, EU rules that came into force in January 2015 specify that certain (less-efficient) motors must be able to adjust their speed. But only around 10 percent of motors in service worldwide are currently equipped with (variable-speed) drives that allow them to do this, even though the energy savings can be substantial -- up to 50 percent in some cases.</P><P>
Another challenge is to establish common MEPS globally. Again, progress is being made in this area, with more and more countries moving toward harmonized standards, but much remains to be done. A recent study commissioned by the European Commission concluded that if the most stringent current MEPS for product energy efficiency were harmonized today, overall global energy consumption would be 9 percent lower, and energy consumption due specifically to products would be 21 percent lower. This would save 8,950 terawatt-hours of electricity, equivalent to closing 165 coal-fired power plants, or taking 132 million cars off the road.</P><P>
The clock is ticking on <mark>climate change</mark>. The weight of scientific opinion is that we don’t have much more time to turn the tide on emissions; otherwise, it will not be possible to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, which is considered the maximum temperature increase we can sustain without triggering potentially catastrophic <mark>climate</mark> events.</P><P>
Of all the actions that can and are being taken to limit <mark>carbon</mark> emissions and mitigate the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, none holds out more promise than improving energy efficiency. There are numerous measures that can be undertaken immediately, without fear of harming economic growth; indeed, since most investments in energy-efficient technology are paid back within a year or two through lower energy costs, they can significantly boost competitiveness, and through the replacement of old equipment, generate additional economic activity.

One might think -- after years of focus on global warming -- that all the easy measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions had already been deployed. And yet, as governments engage in the 21st annual conference on <mark>climate change</mark> (COP21), some surprisingly low-hanging fruit remains.</P><P>
I don’t mean small fruit, either. I’m talking about big, high-yield fruit. Consider this: fitting energy-efficient electric motors on all pumps and fans with devices to regulate their speed would save 3,338 terawatt-hours, roughly equivalent to the amount of electrical energy produced in the EU in 2013.</P><P>
The opportunity is so huge because electric motors are among the biggest consumers of energy. They power all manner of equipment and account for about 40 percent of all electricity consumed worldwide. In the European Union, they are responsible for about 12 percent of total <mark>CO2</mark> emissions, second only to space-heating products.</P><P>
In recent years, the EU, along with several countries such as the United States and China, has imposed new rules requiring older, energy-hungry motors to be phased out. These rules, known as Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS), specify the minimum acceptable efficiency levels of a product, defining which products can be marketed and sold. Typically, these MEPS become more stringent over time. In the EU, for instance, rules requiring a higher efficiency class of motors came into effect in January 2015.</P><P>
MEPS in Europe and their equivalents in other countries will ultimately lead to the upgrading of the installed base of electric motors. However, at the current pace of implementation, and taking account of loopholes and enforcement issues, they will likely fall short of the energy savings needed to achieve <mark>climate</mark> goals, especially given that global energy consumption is expected to increase by 30 percent over the next 15 years.</P><P>
One reason is that MEPS specify the efficiency of individual products, in this case electric motors, rather than the efficiency of motor systems. No matter how efficient a motor is, if it cannot regulate its speed according to load, it will always be operating at full throttle. Legislation is gradually changing to take account of this -- for instance, EU rules that came into force in January 2015 specify that certain (less-efficient) motors must be able to adjust their speed. But only around 10 percent of motors in service worldwide are currently equipped with (variable-speed) drives that allow them to do this, even though the energy savings can be substantial -- up to 50 percent in some cases.</P><P>

This would save 8,950 terawatt-hours of electricity, equivalent to closing 165 coal-fired power plants, or taking 132 million cars off the road.</P><P>

Some 50 percent of the <A href=""http://microgridmedia.com/indias-fast-growing-number-cloud-data-centers-may-spur-microgrid-investments/"" target=""_blank"">renewable energy generated in India</A> passes through <mark>ABB</mark> equipment and the company is keen to capitalize on the confluence of fast rising telecoms and distributed computing, renewable energy and microgrid investment.</P><P>On Nov. 18, <mark>ABB</mark> and IIT Madras, part of India’s premier national engineering college, <A href=""http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/<mark>abb</mark>-india-iit-madras-to-develop-multi-village-microgrid-models/articleshow/55496085.cms"" target=""_blank"">announced</A> they are joining forces to develop a power management platform capable of managing multiple local distributed energy microgrids, whether off-grid or grid-connected. </P><P><STRONG>Microgrids Key to Acheiving India’s Renewable Energy, Rural Electrification Goals</STRONG></P><BLOCKQUOTE class=""wpsm-quote alignleft"" style=""width:34%""><P>This system will also enable the integration of individual solar photovoltaic rooftops to a village microgrid </P><CITE><mark>ABB</mark> in a Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) filing.</CITE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>India intends to have 40 gigawatts (GW) of grid-connected rooftop and small-scale solar power generation capacity online in five years time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised that all villages in India will have access to electricity by 2018 and 24×7 access by 2019, an extremely ambitious goal given the size and geographic diversity of the Indian nation, the regulatory reform required and the fact that more than 250 million Indians lack access at present.</P><P>The national government is following through by instituting new energy policies aimed at accelerating renewable microgrid investment and deployment. That includes launching the Ujjwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY) tariff scheme, and UJALA domestic efficient lighting program.</P><P>In addition the Indian Ministry of New and Renewable Energy <A href=""http://microgridmedia.com/scaling-micro-grids-in-india-connecting-dots/"" target=""_blank"">in June proposed</A> a national policy on renewable energy in which renewable mini and microgrids are singled out as a means of expanding electricity access throughout the vast nation, in particular in rural, remote areas.</P><P><STRONG><mark>ABB</mark> Zooms in on Microgrid Development</STRONG></P><P>For its part, <mark>ABB</mark> has adopted a flexible, customer-driven approach as it marshals its resources and expertise in order to capitalize on growing renewable and hybrid microgrid opportunities, a trend that is now global in scope, Maxine Ghavi, <mark>ABB</mark>’s global director, microgrids, explained in <A href=""http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2016/10/encouraging-results-from-<mark>abb</mark>-s-hybrid-renewable-microgrids.html"" target=""_blank"">a recent interview</A>.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>“The drivers are different in different regions and among different types of customers,” Ghavi said. “It could be resilience, energy security; reducing costs, environmental impacts or reducing reliance on diesel fuel; or providing energy access — the drivers in play in specific markets and situations are multi-polar.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><mark>ABB</mark> has deployed more than 30 microgrids worldwide to date, and it’s in the midst of deploying them worldwide across its own fleet of manufacturing facilities. That includes announcing a project at its largest manufacturing facility in India, and one already up and running in Johannesburg, South Africa.</P><P>The initiative is a core aspect of management’s plans to reduce the organization’s <mark>carbon</mark> and environmental footprints, energy consumption and costs, as well as ensure quality uninterruptible power, Ghavi added.</P><P><mark>ABB</mark>’s microgrid platform, products and services also provide an opportunity to implement and demonstrate the benefits of <mark>ABB</mark>’s “Internet of Things, Services &amp; People” strategy, she noted.</P><DIV class=""sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled""><DIV class=""robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing""><H3 class=""sd-title"">Share</H3></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>","2","2","Positive"
