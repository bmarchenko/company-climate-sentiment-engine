Rather, he said, humanity's larger economic decisions are to blame.</P><SECTION class=""ad medium""><P class=""label"">Advertisement</P></SECTION><P>&quot;The IPCC does not say it's the extraction and production of oil that is driving these emissions,&quot; he said. &quot;It's economic activity that creates the demand for energy, and that leads to emissions.&quot;</P><P>The unusual five-hour hearing was required by Judge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, who is overseeing the cities' lawsuits seeking damages related to sea-level rise and other effects of <mark>climate change</mark>.</P><P>Earlier this month, Alsup asked the cities and oil companies to answer nine questions, including &quot;What are the main sources of <mark>CO2</mark> that account for the incremental buildup of <mark>CO2</mark> in the atmosphere?&quot; and &quot;What are the main sources of heat that account for the incremental rise in temperature on Earth?&quot;</P><P>In answering those questions, Boutrous hewed to the Fifth Assessment Report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark> (IPCC), issued in 2014. His presentation and the cities' presentation overlapped significantly, acknowledging the historic contributions of scientists including Joseph Fourier, John Tyndall, Svante Arrhenius, Gilbert Plass and Roger Revelle.</P><P>But where Boutrous relied nearly exclusively on the U.N. report, which draws on science from 2012 and earlier, the plaintiffs cited more-recent and more-specific findings, like the National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment and the state of California's Ocean Protection Council <A href=""http://www.opc.ca.gov/webmaster/ftp/pdf/docs/rising-seas-in-california-an-update-on-sea-level-rise-science.pdf"">guidance</A> on sea-level rise, both released last year.</P><P>Under active questioning from Alsup, Oxford University physicist Myles Allen explained the details of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide's role in preventing infrared radiation from leaving the atmosphere, how various parts of the Earth absorb the molecules, and how the greenhouse effect works on other planets. He only got through about one-third of his material before he had exhausted his allotted hour.</P><P>&quot;I didn't know that U.S. courts did this kind of thing,&quot; he said in an interview afterward. &quot;I think it's great.&quot;</P><P>Another scientist called by the plaintiffs, Gary Griggs, an oceanographer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who led the state report on sea-level rise, said that sea levels have been rising an average of 1.1 millimeters annually and warned of the possibility that polar ice sheets could melt and cause catastrophic rises.</P><P>Boutrous used the IPCC data to point to decreases in sea surface height off the West Coast from 1993 to 2012 and highlight the uncertainties of future projections of sea-level rise. &quot;Even his own study is saying there's a 0.1 percent chance&quot; of a 10-foot sea-level rise off San Francisco by 2100, he said of Griggs' research.</P><P>Alsup asked the plaintiffs where they differed from <mark>Chevron</mark>'s positions.</P><P>&quot;They do agree that humans are putting <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide into the air, that does in fact cause warming, that does in fact cause sea-level rise,&quot; Alsup said. &quot;What critique would you make of what I just heard from the other side? They seem to be largely agreeing.&quot;</P><P>&quot;That's not what you see at all in the media, and that's why these points are emphasized,&quot; said Don Wuebbles, a University of Illinois atmospheric scientist who led a special science report for the most recent National <mark>Climate</mark> Assessment and was assistant director at the Office of Science and Technology Policy under former President Obama. Wuebbles pointed out that over the past century, sea levels off San Francisco have risen 7.7 inches, according to tide gauges.</P><P>&quot;If you look at the time period since 2012, you actually go back to seeing an increase in the region,&quot; he said. &quot;That is a little different than the picture he [Boutrous] was trying to paint in his presentation. Again, the science does not stop in 2012.&quot;</P><P>The San Francisco and Oakland cases are among numerous lawsuits from California municipalities against oil companies for <mark>climate</mark> damages. Federal court Judge Vince Chhabria — located in the same building as Alsup — last week ruled that lawsuits from Imperial Beach, San Mateo and Marin County should not have been moved to federal court and sent them back to state court. He said that federal common law does not govern their claims. He's also handling suits from Richmond, Santa Cruz and Santa Cruz County but hasn't ruled yet on whether those should go back to state court. <mark>Chevron</mark> and ConocoPhillips are appealing Chhabria's decision.</P><P>&quot;As the defendants note, these state law claims raise national and perhaps global questions,&quot; Chhabria said in the order affecting Imperial Beach, San Mateo and Marin County. &quot;It may even be that these local actions are federally preempted. But to justify removal from state court to federal court, a defendant must be able to show that the case being removed fits within one of a small handful of small boxes. Because these lawsuits do not fit within any of those boxes, they were properly filed in state court and improperly removed to federal court.&quot;</P><P>Alsup ordered the other defendants in the suit — BP PLC, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, all of which had representatives at the hearing — to submit briefs within two weeks detailing any points of disagreement with <mark>Chevron</mark>. &quot;Otherwise, I'm going to assume you're in agreement,&quot; he said. &quot;You can't get away with sitting there in silence and then later say, 'He wasn't speaking for us.'&quot;</P><P>Plaintiffs criticized <mark>Chevron</mark> and the other companies' approach.</P><P>&quot;What we saw today was one oil company begrudgingly accept the scientific consensus while trying to overemphasize the extent of scientific uncertainty,&quot; San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said in a statement. &quot;The other four major oil companies refused to even participate or recognize the court has jurisdiction over them. Apparently they think they're above the law.&quot;</P><P>Other observers said that it was notable that <mark>Chevron</mark> acknowledged mainstream <mark>climate</mark> science, but that it could be years before the case is resolved. The companies have all filed motions to dismiss both suits; presuming the suits continue, both courts would need to reach decisions before an appeal could be heard.</P><P>&quot;The sea-rise evidence and the sea-rise data is so much stronger than it was six years ago that they can kind of use the IPCC as a conservative approach, whereas the plaintiffs are taking the current, state-of-the-art approach,&quot; said Bill Rossbach, a trial lawyer consulting for the Center for <mark>Climate</mark> Integrity.</P><P>&quot;I'm sure they have other bases for thinking that they are not liable, and those are all going to be put forth in legal arguments to have the court throw the case out,&quot; he said. &quot;There's a long way from here to them writing a check.&quot;</P><P><EM>Reporter Anne C.

And as the Trump administration seeks to play down <mark>climate change</mark>, some states are pushing back. Now, two California cities have brought a lawsuit against the <mark>Chevron</mark> Corporation and other big oil companies, looking to find them responsible for their role in <mark>climate change</mark>. And because the federal judge in the case felt he wasn’t quite up on his <mark>climate</mark> science, he asked each side to teach him how they view the state of the research.</P><P>Molly Peterson was in that courtroom and is here to fill us in on that story. She’s a reporter for KQED Science out there in San Francisco. Thanks for joining us this hour.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Yeah, my pleasure.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: So each side had a different tactic for presenting the <mark>climate</mark> data. Tell us. <mark>Chevron</mark> was the only company, though, representing all the oil companies.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Yeah, that day, he was. So for both sides, the judge wanted both the current state of the science and a kind of history of what they knew, what scientists knew, when they knew it. Each side had two hours to present. The cities turned it over to scientists. The City Attorney was there to introduce scientists to give this story. And <mark>Chevron</mark> used a lawyer to convey its information.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: So what was his argument?</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Well, I mean, he went on the record saying, it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the 20th century. So <mark>Chevron</mark> says, it has been its position for 10 years that it accepts the findings of the IPCC report. But at the same time, <mark>Chevron</mark> was also pointing out and casting doubt wherever it could on how certain scientists were about the influence of humans on <mark>climate change</mark> over this time.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: And so San Francisco and Oakland are the two cities involved in this case. And so they presented their side.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: And their side focused a lot on sea level rise, because obviously, that’s a major concern in California. And I should say that this is part of this growing body of cases, not just San Francisco and Oakland, but the city of Richmond, San Mateo County, Imperial, Beach in Southern California, these other cities are also suing using different legal strategies that one historian of science kind of told me reminded him of the tobacco lawsuits.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: Yeah. And so, they’re upset, of course, that if the oceans are rising, they’re going to be underwater. And they can show, then, that there is actual money damages that are going to occur to their cities.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: That’s right. I mean, in San Francisco in particular, they’re talking about billions of dollars, including, I think, a $350 million bond that might be on the ballot there later this year. The city’s got engineers and consultants out there, trying to figure out what would happen to the Embarcadero along San Francisco. So yeah, they are connecting it to that.</P><P>And so, the presence of IPCC science and scientists was interesting and important, because the most recent IPCC was 2013, 2014. The end of the data for that report was 2012. And a lot has happened in sea level rise science since then.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: Now, I understand this isn’t the first time that this judge has done research for a court case.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: No, it’s not. And he doesn’t do it exclusively in science. But he did it for LIDAR in a case involving self-driving cars. He did it for DACA recently. He’s famous for having taught himself how to program in Basic, and for learning a few lines of Java for a case involving Oracle.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: Wow. So where does this head? This is not the actual court case itself, right?</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: It’s not. In fact, <mark>Chevron</mark> was kind of subtly trying to make this argument that it is also filed with the court a motion to dismiss. <mark>Chevron</mark> says, this is a global problem. It needs a global solution. So even though they’re saying that human activity contributed to this, they say that they’re beyond the reach of this court. So the judge still has to rule on that.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: So do all of the oil companies agree with what <mark>Chevron</mark> is saying?</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Well, at the of the hearing, the judge looked at the other oil companies and said, do you agree with everything this guy said? And they all kind of sat there. And he said, well, you can have two weeks, which is up just about now, for them to weigh in on every single word that was said. So he said to them, his message was clear, you can’t get away sitting here in silence.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: So there’s going to be a lot more we’re going to hear about this, as it moves forward.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Yeah. I mean, it is interesting that the judge is trying to figure out how to use this science as evidence, if the case goes forward. Yeah,</P><P>IRA FLATOW: And how, then, to turn it into damages, if you’re going to penalize somebody. What’s your role or your part in it?</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Yeah. I mean, with the tobacco cases, I think we’re talking about $250 billion so far that tobacco companies have paid as settlements.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: Well, we’ll see. Thank you, Molly, for taking time to be with us today. We’ll check in later as it’s necessary.

She’s based in Los Angeles, California.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordions l-row-txt""><DIV class=""accordion-row""><DIV class=""toggle-content""><P>IRA FLATOW: And now, it’s time to check in on the state of science.</P><P>SPEAKER 2: This is KER–</P><P>SPEAKER 3: For WWNO–</P><P>SPEAKER 4: St. Louis Public Radio.</P><P>SPEAKER 5: Iowa Public Radio News.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: Local science stories of national importance. And as the Trump administration seeks to play down <mark>climate change</mark>, some states are pushing back. Now, two California cities have brought a lawsuit against the <mark>Chevron</mark> Corporation and other big oil companies, looking to find them responsible for their role in <mark>climate change</mark>. And because the federal judge in the case felt he wasn’t quite up on his <mark>climate</mark> science, he asked each side to teach him how they view the state of the research.</P><P>Molly Peterson was in that courtroom and is here to fill us in on that story. She’s a reporter for KQED Science out there in San Francisco. Thanks for joining us this hour.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Yeah, my pleasure.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: So each side had a different tactic for presenting the <mark>climate</mark> data. Tell us. <mark>Chevron</mark> was the only company, though, representing all the oil companies.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Yeah, that day, he was. So for both sides, the judge wanted both the current state of the science and a kind of history of what they knew, what scientists knew, when they knew it. Each side had two hours to present. The cities turned it over to scientists. The City Attorney was there to introduce scientists to give this story. And <mark>Chevron</mark> used a lawyer to convey its information.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: So what was his argument?</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Well, I mean, he went on the record saying, it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the 20th century. So <mark>Chevron</mark> says, it has been its position for 10 years that it accepts the findings of the IPCC report. But at the same time, <mark>Chevron</mark> was also pointing out and casting doubt wherever it could on how certain scientists were about the influence of humans on <mark>climate change</mark> over this time.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: And so San Francisco and Oakland are the two cities involved in this case. And so they presented their side.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: And their side focused a lot on sea level rise, because obviously, that’s a major concern in California. And I should say that this is part of this growing body of cases, not just San Francisco and Oakland, but the city of Richmond, San Mateo County, Imperial, Beach in Southern California, these other cities are also suing using different legal strategies that one historian of science kind of told me reminded him of the tobacco lawsuits.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: Yeah. And so, they’re upset, of course, that if the oceans are rising, they’re going to be underwater. And they can show, then, that there is actual money damages that are going to occur to their cities.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: That’s right. I mean, in San Francisco in particular, they’re talking about billions of dollars, including, I think, a $350 million bond that might be on the ballot there later this year. The city’s got engineers and consultants out there, trying to figure out what would happen to the Embarcadero along San Francisco. So yeah, they are connecting it to that.</P><P>And so, the presence of IPCC science and scientists was interesting and important, because the most recent IPCC was 2013, 2014. The end of the data for that report was 2012. And a lot has happened in sea level rise science since then.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: Now, I understand this isn’t the first time that this judge has done research for a court case.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: No, it’s not. And he doesn’t do it exclusively in science. But he did it for LIDAR in a case involving self-driving cars. He did it for DACA recently. He’s famous for having taught himself how to program in Basic, and for learning a few lines of Java for a case involving Oracle.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: Wow. So where does this head? This is not the actual court case itself, right?</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: It’s not. In fact, <mark>Chevron</mark> was kind of subtly trying to make this argument that it is also filed with the court a motion to dismiss. <mark>Chevron</mark> says, this is a global problem. It needs a global solution. So even though they’re saying that human activity contributed to this, they say that they’re beyond the reach of this court. So the judge still has to rule on that.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: So do all of the oil companies agree with what <mark>Chevron</mark> is saying?</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Well, at the of the hearing, the judge looked at the other oil companies and said, do you agree with everything this guy said? And they all kind of sat there. And he said, well, you can have two weeks, which is up just about now, for them to weigh in on every single word that was said. So he said to them, his message was clear, you can’t get away sitting here in silence.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: So there’s going to be a lot more we’re going to hear about this, as it moves forward.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Yeah. I mean, it is interesting that the judge is trying to figure out how to use this science as evidence, if the case goes forward. Yeah,</P><P>IRA FLATOW: And how, then, to turn it into damages, if you’re going to penalize somebody. What’s your role or your part in it?</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Yeah. I mean, with the tobacco cases, I think we’re talking about $250 billion so far that tobacco companies have paid as settlements.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: Well, we’ll see. Thank you, Molly, for taking time to be with us today. We’ll check in later as it’s necessary.

She’s based in Los Angeles, California.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class=""accordions l-row-txt""><DIV class=""accordion-row""><DIV class=""toggle-content""><P>IRA FLATOW: And now, it’s time to check in on the state of science.</P><P>SPEAKER 2: This is KER–</P><P>SPEAKER 3: For WWNO–</P><P>SPEAKER 4: St. Louis Public Radio.</P><P>SPEAKER 5: Iowa Public Radio News.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: Local science stories of national importance. And as the Trump administration seeks to play down <mark>climate change</mark>, some states are pushing back. Now, two California cities have brought a lawsuit against the <mark>Chevron</mark> Corporation and other big oil companies, looking to find them responsible for their role in <mark>climate change</mark>. And because the federal judge in the case felt he wasn’t quite up on his <mark>climate</mark> science, he asked each side to teach him how they view the state of the research.</P><P>Molly Peterson was in that courtroom and is here to fill us in on that story. She’s a reporter for KQED Science out there in San Francisco. Thanks for joining us this hour.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Yeah, my pleasure.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: So each side had a different tactic for presenting the <mark>climate</mark> data. Tell us. <mark>Chevron</mark> was the only company, though, representing all the oil companies.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Yeah, that day, he was. So for both sides, the judge wanted both the current state of the science and a kind of history of what they knew, what scientists knew, when they knew it. Each side had two hours to present. The cities turned it over to scientists. The City Attorney was there to introduce scientists to give this story. And <mark>Chevron</mark> used a lawyer to convey its information.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: So what was his argument?</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Well, I mean, he went on the record saying, it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the 20th century. So <mark>Chevron</mark> says, it has been its position for 10 years that it accepts the findings of the IPCC report. But at the same time, <mark>Chevron</mark> was also pointing out and casting doubt wherever it could on how certain scientists were about the influence of humans on <mark>climate change</mark> over this time.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: And so San Francisco and Oakland are the two cities involved in this case. And so they presented their side.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: And their side focused a lot on sea level rise, because obviously, that’s a major concern in California. And I should say that this is part of this growing body of cases, not just San Francisco and Oakland, but the city of Richmond, San Mateo County, Imperial, Beach in Southern California, these other cities are also suing using different legal strategies that one historian of science kind of told me reminded him of the tobacco lawsuits.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: Yeah. And so, they’re upset, of course, that if the oceans are rising, they’re going to be underwater. And they can show, then, that there is actual money damages that are going to occur to their cities.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: That’s right. I mean, in San Francisco in particular, they’re talking about billions of dollars, including, I think, a $350 million bond that might be on the ballot there later this year. The city’s got engineers and consultants out there, trying to figure out what would happen to the Embarcadero along San Francisco. So yeah, they are connecting it to that.</P><P>And so, the presence of IPCC science and scientists was interesting and important, because the most recent IPCC was 2013, 2014. The end of the data for that report was 2012. And a lot has happened in sea level rise science since then.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: Now, I understand this isn’t the first time that this judge has done research for a court case.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: No, it’s not. And he doesn’t do it exclusively in science. But he did it for LIDAR in a case involving self-driving cars. He did it for DACA recently. He’s famous for having taught himself how to program in Basic, and for learning a few lines of Java for a case involving Oracle.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: Wow. So where does this head? This is not the actual court case itself, right?</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: It’s not. In fact, <mark>Chevron</mark> was kind of subtly trying to make this argument that it is also filed with the court a motion to dismiss. <mark>Chevron</mark> says, this is a global problem. It needs a global solution. So even though they’re saying that human activity contributed to this, they say that they’re beyond the reach of this court. So the judge still has to rule on that.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: So do all of the oil companies agree with what <mark>Chevron</mark> is saying?</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Well, at the of the hearing, the judge looked at the other oil companies and said, do you agree with everything this guy said? And they all kind of sat there. And he said, well, you can have two weeks, which is up just about now, for them to weigh in on every single word that was said. So he said to them, his message was clear, you can’t get away sitting here in silence.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: So there’s going to be a lot more we’re going to hear about this, as it moves forward.</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Yeah. I mean, it is interesting that the judge is trying to figure out how to use this science as evidence, if the case goes forward. Yeah,</P><P>IRA FLATOW: And how, then, to turn it into damages, if you’re going to penalize somebody. What’s your role or your part in it?</P><P>MOLLY PETERSON: Yeah. I mean, with the tobacco cases, I think we’re talking about $250 billion so far that tobacco companies have paid as settlements.</P><P>IRA FLATOW: Well, we’ll see. Thank you, Molly, for taking time to be with us today. We’ll check in later as it’s necessary.

BP,</EM><A name=""_ftnref1"" href=""#_ftn1"">[1]</A>  Judge Alsup fired questions about global warming and <mark>climate change</mark> at plaintiffs and defendants alike.  The local governments have alleged that five major energy companies created a public nuisance by extracting and promoting the sale of fossil fuels with the knowledge that such products caused global warming.</P><P>Only one of the defendants’ attorneys spoke at the tutorial.  Counsel for <mark>Chevron</mark> accepted the general scientific consensus that humans are primarily responsible for <mark>climate change</mark>.  However, focusing extensively on a 2013 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on <mark>Climate Change</mark>, <mark>Chevron</mark>’s lawyer highlighted uncertainties surrounding the effects of <mark>climate change</mark>, including sea level rise. </P><P>The cities called several experts to present their side to the court.  Myles Allen, head of the <mark>Climate</mark> Dynamics group at the University of Oxford, asserted that science has recognized since the 1950’s the effects and sources of <mark>carbon</mark> dioxide in the atmosphere.  University of California at Santa Cruz professor Gary Griggs and University of Illinois professor Don Wuebbles outlined the increasing rate of sea level rise.</P><P>Judge Alsup, who has employed tutorials in other complex scientific cases, indicated at the end of the hearing that the remaining defendant companies, who have objected to the court’s personal jurisdiction, had two weeks to file written statements agreeing with or refuting points made by <mark>Chevron</mark>’s counsel.<A name=""_ftnref2"" href=""#_ftn2""><SPAN>[2]</SPAN></A>  </P><P><STRONG>Motions to Dismiss – San Francisco/Oakland Cases</STRONG></P><P>A day before the tutorial, defendants in the Oakland and San Francisco cases filed several motions to dismiss the lawsuits.<A name=""_ftnref3"" href=""#_ftn3""><SPAN>[3]</SPAN></A>  The primary motion, filed by <mark>Chevron</mark> and joined by the other defendants, centered on an argument that the Clean Air Act displaced the plaintiffs’ claims. </P><P>Defendants argued that, despite the focus of the cities’ claims on the production and sale of fossil fuels, not the eventual combustion of those fuels, the court should hold that the “domestic portions” of plaintiffs’ claims at least are displaced under <EM>AEP v. Connecticut</EM><A name=""_ftnref4"" href=""#_ftn4"">[4]</A> and <EM>Kivalina v. ExxonMobil</EM><A name=""_ftnref5"" href=""#_ftn5"">[5]</A> “because they ultimately turn on the alleged harm caused by domestic fossil fuel emissions.”<A name=""_ftnref6"" href=""#_ftn6""><SPAN>[6]</SPAN></A>   </P><P>Defendants added that even if plaintiffs’ claims do target fossil fuel production and promotion rather than emissions, the claims are displaced by other federal statutes, like the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1992 and the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which encourage and regulate such conduct.<A name=""_ftnref7"" href=""#_ftn7""><SPAN>[7]</SPAN></A>  </P><P>The defendants also posited that the cities’ allegations did not meet the elements of a federal common law claim for public nuisance, asserting, among other defects: (1) the failure to show that defendants’ conduct caused the injuries alleged, (2) the lack of defendants’ control over the fossil fuels when they were combusted, and (3) the relief sought – billions of dollars in adaptation funding – is unconstitutional.<A name=""_ftnref8"" href=""#_ftn8""><SPAN>[8]</SPAN></A>  Additionally, defendants asserted that the plaintiffs “cannot prove that worldwide greenhouse gas emissions would have been materially lower but for Defendants’ conduct.”<A name=""_ftnref9"" href=""#_ftn9""><SPAN>[9]</SPAN></A>  </P><P>In parallel motions to dismiss, several defendants also argued that the court could not exercise personal jurisdiction over them.<A name=""_ftnref10"" href=""#_ftn10""><SPAN>[10]</SPAN></A>  Shell also claimed that service of process was insufficient, an alleged flaw which Judge Alsup has suggested is curable.<A name=""_ftnref11"" href=""#_ftn11""><SPAN>[11]</SPAN></A>   </P><P><STRONG>Remand and District Level Split – San Mateo and Marin Counties, City of Imperial Beach</STRONG></P><P>U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria, presiding over similar <mark>climate change</mark> liability cases by multiple California local governments against an assortment of energy companies in <EM>County of San Mateo v. <mark>Chevron</mark></EM>,<A name=""_ftnref12"" href=""#_ftn12""><SPAN>[12]</SPAN></A>  granted the plaintiffs’ motions to remand their claims back to state court.<A name=""_ftnref13"" href=""#_ftn13""><SPAN>[13]</SPAN></A>  The court’s ruling creates a district-level split (Judge Alsup in the Oakland and San Francisco litigation <A href=""http://www.bdlaw.com/news-2201.html"">denied</A> plaintiffs’ motion to remand), presaging a future decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on whether the potentially ground-breaking common law claims can remain in federal court.</P><P>Judge Chhabria held that plaintiffs’ claims are not materially different than those in <EM>Kivalina</EM>, which held that such common law nuisance claims are displaced at the federal level by the Clean Air Act.  According to Judge Chhabria, “[s]imply put, these cases should not have been removed to federal court on the basis of federal common law that no longer exists.”<A name=""_ftnref14"" href=""#_ftn14""><SPAN>[14]</SPAN></A>  </P><P>In support of the ruling, the Judge also held that plaintiffs’ claims were not “completely preempted” by the Clean Air Act, which preserves “state causes of action.”<A name=""_ftnref15"" href=""#_ftn15""><SPAN>[15]</SPAN></A>  If the cases return to state court, however, the preemptive effect of the Clean Air Act will be contested hotly there as well.</P><P>The court also disagreed with defendants’ arguments that removal to federal court was warranted on the basis of so-called <EM>Grable</EM> jurisdiction<A name=""_ftnref16"" href=""#_ftn16""><SPAN>[16]</SPAN></A> or any other “specialized statutory removal provisions.”<A name=""_ftnref17"" href=""#_ftn17""><SPAN>[17]</SPAN></A>  </P><P>The court delayed its remand order while it considers whether the order should be certified for interlocutory appeal to the Ninth Circuit. </P><P><STRONG>Implications</STRONG></P><P>Given the stakes, the Ninth Circuit – and, sooner or later, the Supreme Court – will be asked to resolve whether, consistent with prior precedent, any <mark>climate change</mark> tort claims may be brought in federal forums.  And, following a decision on the pending motions to dismiss in the Oakland and San Francisco cases, we can expect to see further controversy over whether federal common law can theoretically provide a remedy for these massive claims.   But, even if federal common law cannot be used by the plaintiffs, decisions in these cases that leave open the possibility of state tort law claims ultimately may be pyrrhic victories for the defendants.    </P><P><EM>Beveridge &amp; Diamond represents major industry associations, corporations, and other entities in the energy, transportation, manufacturing, and emissions trading sectors on <mark>climate change</mark> issues and domestic and international greenhouse gas regulatory programs.

They also allege the companies mounted campaigns to downplay the risks of global warming and discredit research that human activity was to blame.</P><P> The companies have asked the judge to dismiss the lawsuits. Federal law controls fossil fuel production, and Congress has encouraged oil and gas development, they said in court documents. They say the harm the cities claim is &quot;speculative&quot; and part of a complex chain of events that includes billions of oil and gas users and &quot;environmental phenomena occurring worldwide over many decades.&quot;</P><P> Legal observers said they had never heard of a court holding a tutorial on <mark>climate change</mark>, and they were eager to see how the oil companies explained global warming.</P><P> None of the other companies spoke.
